The Code for this Project is housed in seperate Jupyter Notebooks

Getting the Data:
 - Twitter Data: https://www.kaggle.com/alaix14/bitcoin-tweets-20160101-to-20190329
 - Reddit Data: Scraped using the PRAW API from December 2017 - March 2019 for the daily discussion threads on r/Bitcoin

The Reddit Crypto Price Predictor.ipynb contains everything needed to work with the Reddit code and train the SVM model
 - Some cells may be out of order, because code was moved around, so if you don't have a variable search for it and run the cell that creates it
 
The Notebook for the Twitter Data is in twitter.ipynb
