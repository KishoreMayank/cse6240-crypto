How it's priced will eventually be dependant on it's risk appetite.\n\n0% risk will probably mean conversion from/to fiat at point of sale and passing on all overheads including transaction fee to customers.  A higher risk appetite may mean setting aside a BTC settlement account.  This is very common in MNCs where foreign currencies from non-US subsidiaries are managed separately.",

Once the price catches up with the rapid advancement we see in framework, this simple strategy could bring in some hefty long term gains.   \nIf you worry about the price bouncing between 6-10k, you could be worried for a long time. Buy it during the lows, and your worst case scenario is breaking even. There's too much viral activity and effort underway to see Bitcoin going away, and once it acquires the volume of investment needed to initiate new ATH's (and I believe it will), your future self will thank your present self for having a realistic perspective of how long it takes these things to evolve and see mass adoption.",

If the utility of that thing is less than the currency you are spending for it, you don't buy it. The fact that the currency has more purchasing power next week doesn't really matter, except for the fact that it makes being efficient with your spending more worthwhile. I guess I would expect people to be less wasteful with their spending, which will probably hurt sales in some areas, but these areas already prey on impulse spending. Like dippin dots at the mall.

Despite coin price volatility, the growth in supporting technology, exchanges, apps, awareness and much more continues and does not suffer from this volatility in any way. So I see the price stability eventually catching up with the stability in framework advancement. I don't doubt for a minute that Bitcoin and crypto investments will never dissipate to a point where the coin price would completely tank. Until the price catches up, modest investing during price slumps may be the best strategy for long term gain.",

So, they may do a hybrid of what you propose with you paying what you want and it goes to your Bakkt account and makes the transfer from your fiat to BTC they have in \"the warehouse\" or some version of that.

            "Text": "Yeah, it\u2019s a common thing to use known information, patterns, account for unknowns and then ascribe a % chance to something.  Like for instance, if you flip a coin and could say, there is about a 50% chance it will land with a specific side facing up.  Technically I\u2019m just making that number up because there is a minuscule chance the coin could land on its edge, or be struck by lightening in the air, vaporized and never land.  Those possible outcomes are so remote as not to be considered in my 50/50 hypothesis.\n\nMost folks are taking the information that they know.  One piece being the organization submitting/backing the ETF proposal, the CBOE.  That increases the likelihood of approval ie, increases the % chance of approval....wait a minute, did you really need all that spelled out, do I need to continue showing you each piece of known data that would bring someone to the estimation of 90% likelihood of approval??? Naaaw, you\u2019re jerking my chain, right?  Anyway, yeah we\u2019re just making it up.",
