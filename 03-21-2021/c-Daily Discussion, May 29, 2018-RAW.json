That's ridiculous. No one will pay 500 and so on. What matters is perceived value. We are coming off of a low right now and the majority of people still have an emotional bearish bias. You also have the second issue of people who have been around for quite awhile and they remember $1,000 at the beginning of last year. The truth of the matter is the price can go anywhere but the real fun will be had if it goes considerably higher. All of the people who have disbelief. All of the people that think it's overvalued. If the price continues to climb the overwhelming majority of them will eventually give in and this creates a massive buying wave ",

You have banks that are in a tightening cycle and then you have Italy. If this plays out like I'm guessing they are going to be able to delay it for awhile but Italy is going to be one of the main catalysts of the global recession as we go into the next easing cycle. The only unpredictable part is how bad the inflation will be and how many billions of dollars worth of bonds they have to give Italy to get them solvent. \n\nIf there is talk about isolation there is no practical way to pull it off. How would they repay their obligation to the European Central Bank? An exit strategy would simply leave them with a lot of high interest bonds to try and finance their government. Greece quickly comes to mind here. ",
