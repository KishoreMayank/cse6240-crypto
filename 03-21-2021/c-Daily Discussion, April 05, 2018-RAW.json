The general environment at lows can be uncertain and worrying. The sentiment of many people is that everyone will sell or that the whole system will collapse. It is normally darkest just before dawn.

            "Text": "I disagree with your first paragraph. There are always buyers and sellers. Broadly, the market drops if more people want to sell than people who want to buy, and it rises if more people want to buy than people who want to sell. Obviously, it\u2019s to do with volume rather than number of people, but it was easier to write that way. \n\nIf a market hits the bottom, it is because the number of people wanting to sell becomes in equilibrium with the number of people wanting to buy. This could either be because the lower price has attracted more buyers or because its deterred the excess sellers. Usually, it\u2019s both. It is not purely down to the sellers, like you say above.",

Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.\n\n\u201cThis is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cHistorical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.\u201d\n\nLee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017.\n\nA crypto bull who maintains a year-end price target on Bitcoin of $25,000, Lee sees the selling pressure passing.\n\n\u201cWe still like Bitcoin and large-caps,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwhile we believe the bear market for alt coins is largely over, we do not see upside for alts until mid-August.\u201d",

            "Text": "Because when every coin is crashing down at 70% below the ATH, then its a sign that the whole market is pretty much gone up in smoke. Back when this happened 3-4 years ago, bitcoins weren't worth a lot of money - which is why it had stabilized for so long and then went up when more and more investors took advantage of the opportunity to hoard many coins to dump at the right time. Those investors are long gone. Never coming back. Bitcoins will probably never see the light of the $20k price tag again. Sorry but it will take a long time for bitcoins to rebound to even half of where it was before. If you really care about your money, I would NOT buy anymore bitcoins but rather keep the ones you have and hope to recoup as much loss as you can before the inevitable happens. That's what I'm gonna do; not hold on to the coins like an idiot when the opportunity to sell shows up again like it did when it reached almost $12k in Feb.",

What will happen is a fair amount of true believers WILL NOT sell now to pay their taxes,  they will pay the non payment penalty,  and pay the interest , hoping that their crypto will recover.  In 2001 that created the tax hangover,   look back and look at NASDAQ from April 2001.  My friend was just such a hold out.  He finally sold 7 months AFTER April 15, unwilling to pay the interest any further.",

What matters is what he says during interviews.  Ive seen just about every interview of him since last May 2017 and I get the impression he has a strong grasp on the technology and industry.  He's and old man at this point and has nothing to gain by spewing lies.  Sure he may get paid 100k to promote coins, or to promote whatever, but during his candid interviews or speeches he's given on stage its generally about the technology and its implication and use cases\n\n\n His bio - is a British-American computer programmer and businessman. He founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987 and ran it until 1994, when he resigned from the company. McAfee Associates achieved early success as the creators of McAfee, the first commercial antivirus software, and the business now produces a range of enterprise security software. The company was renamed to Intel Security in 2011 after being purchased by Intel, though the software still retains the McAfee brand name. McAfee's wealth peaked in 2007 at $100 million, before his investments plummeted in the global financial crisis that began that yeaimmediately states he is a computer programmer and business man.

Bitcoin will bottom out within seconds if there is a crash because people don't think straight. They are panicked, and sell all their investments. Suddenly that 40k bitcoin hits like $500. That's what the millionaires want, a crash so they can buy it all for cash and then own everything. The 1% always rig the system because they have enough money to buy everything during the fire sale should the banks crash. Sure the upper middle class take the hit but the big players with huge reserves of cash can buy everything up.\n\nRemember, if you are a giant mall owner, and suddenly ALL of your tenants can't pay rent, and you can't pay the bank, you are in big freaking trouble. I would love to know what Simon Malls would do in that situation? File bankruptcy to the builders and sit in trouble, or sell for 1/10 of a dollar to Warren Buffet?\n\nI love the idea of the bitcoin trade happening, but is it realistic in the event of a financial collapse? It will be interesting to see what happens with this trade war and impending interest hike. Trump will cause a collapse, yes, but how and when is the issue.",

But if $1 million was peanuts to you, and if deep down you had good reason to suspect beanie babies would double your money in a year - then there would be logic in the investment\n\nThe risk would be worth taking and is therefore logical. \n\nIllogical would be investing in something that you DIDNT think would make you money. That\u2019s illogical. And if one thinks Bitcoin won\u2019t ever make them money then they shouldn\u2019t buy any. Not $5000 not $50 not $5. \n\nBut if you truly believe it will increase in value then a $500,000 investment is just as logical as a $50 one - (more so actually) - provided that the loss of that money would have no impact on your life. \n\n\n\n",

Then the oscillations will dip down in the mid 6000s again.  That's what I see when I look at the charts.  We're still on a downswing on the 6h chart and the 1d chart, hence why the overall trend will continue downward, and I believe people should be taking advantage of the oscillations on the 1h cycle, if so inclined.",
