Then there would be the 'rational actor' argument - would a rational person tank the market, or release those coins slowly?  The latter is far more likely.  Thirdly, there is the judgement - what if those coins *were* suddenly released?  That would certainly tank the market in the short term, but given the finite supply, the value of Bitcoin would be expected to recover, albeit perhaps at a lower price for a few years.\n\nIf those coins belong to an individual, I really do wonder if he is still alive.\n\nIf Satoshi is a group, perhaps the splitting of the private key was such that circumstances changed in a way that no-one can use it.\n\nI sometimes suspect the latter.",

You long to travel to the stars, if only for a bit, and spend a portion of your vast wealth to secure a flight on a trip in orbit around the Earth. \n\nUnbeknownst to you, word of your trip has spread, and gave a vicious, well-funded group of mercenaries a bold idea. They have their own launch trip, aided by a country at odds with your nation, and are able to match your orbit. Special hardware is used to block all signals to or from Earth from your ship - the only signal you can get is from this new group of space brigands. \n\nThey inform you that their ground team has captured your lovely wife and family. They will release them safely, but only if you send a sizable portion of your net worth. Naturally, you explain how you can't arrange this transfer if they're blocking all signals from you to Earth. Their malicious laughter fills the air as one replies that obviously a man of your means and technical knowledge would have secured a sizable chunk of Bitcoin, and would be able to pass along your brain wallet to them verbally. They're giving you five minutes to think about it before they give the order to kill your family.\n\nYou gaze out the window, tears in your eyes - even the majestic sight of the Earth from space cannot move you now. Do you send your Bitcoins to save your family? Keep your wealth? Or is the choice not even yours, from the great panic-selling of 2018?",

In five years (if you hodl) you might laugh at the newbs coming on saying 'this bear market at 45k is killing me, will it ever go back to +100k?? was it the same back THEN?\"\n\nOn the other hand, nobody knows. Bitcoin is still completely wild west. We are out at the frontiers of an unprecedented technology. \n\nOn the other hand, without people believing in the vision + tech and (also) putting their money in, price would still be around 3$ or it would have died off long ago.\n\nSo propz.\n\n",
