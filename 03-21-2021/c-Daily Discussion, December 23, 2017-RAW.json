For the bitcoin noobs it'll teach you when to invest, and not recklessly invest. Dont immediately spend your kids college funds on bitcoin at 19k (i've seen a ton of posts like that, no trolls actual people.) because you might be able to buy it lower. Dont be afraid to wait on your chance to buy bitcoin the bus isnt always leaving, after a increase like we've had its destined there will be a decrease. \n\nFinally the main topic I wanted to talk about is \"BELIEVE IN YOUR INVESTMENT\" believe crypto is the future, realize the power it holds. Small minds will call it a scam, media will always talk about a dip and say \"bitcoin finally crashes\" its all BS, a increase like we had they couldnt wait to talk about this dip. Trust in your cryptos. People use this everyday, the likely hood of \"the end of bitcoin\" happening tomorrow is unlikely. When centralized dollars arent working around the world, our cryptos will have value over the over printed dollar bills every country has. \n\nBuy the dip. Watch it grow!",

They bought in at price points between 11k and 15k and panic sold yesterday at like 12k.\n\nSome still have a bit of their portfolio left.\n\nYeah, it looked bad. I get it, everyone has their own risk tolerance and if you need to sell, you need to sell. But it was a bad day for cryptos across the board. Bitcoin is weathering the BCH bullshit with coinbase and gdax. Overall in this month, we're still up 5k from hitting the 10k mark. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. It's gonna go up, it's gonna go down.\n\nYou haven't actually lost until you sell at a lower price than you bought at.\n\nSorry for the mini rant yall. This is a long term thing. It's bound to fluctuate up and down.",

I have a few day trades on stuff from early on, some of which happened on the same day. Blockfolio isn't organizing the same day transactions in the order I entered them. Some sell orders are showing up after my buy orders, so my unintentional sell low/buy high strategy isn't properly reflected.\n\n~~In Delta the prices it shows on the Transaction history are different than what I entered. Yet if I go into the details to check, the correct purchase price is there. For example I purchased 0.05067556 BTC @ $7,049.49, but it shows $6,972.65 on the page that lists out all the transactions. Delta does allow you to specify a purchase time (which is awesome and my problem with Blockfolio).~~\n\nEDIT: /u/keithkman made me double check I was entering the correct exchange for my transactions. That fixed my Delta problem.\n\nAlso, and this is for both apps, how can I enter a transfer from my account on one exchange to my account on another exchange (that then got turned into Alt coins). So I didn't really sell or buy, I just transferred the money.\n\nDoes anyone know of a fix to either problem?",

How is the volume  so high at $2,855,950,000? Are people just swapping between each other?\n\nEthereum has about a 6:1 advantage on circulating currency, and the volume is less.\n\nAm I making something out of nothing? Clueless?

            "Text": "As a currency, bitcoin fails the three basic characteristics of a good currency, it's a bad store of value, a bad medium of exchange, and a bad measure of account. A currency that's a store of value isn't supposed to loss 25% of it's value in increase 1000% percent in a short time span. As a medium of exchange, bitcoin is slow, expensive to use and has decent barriers to entry of use. Furthermore it's a bad measure of account something that costs 3$ is far more legible and understandable than something costing .000000000192848953 bitcoin. Plus I know that a object tomorrow is going to cost 3$, not so with bitcoin which greatly increases or decreases.  ",

            "Text": "**Why the next big crash will occur in Jan. 2018, When Coinbase allows BCash to be sold**\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the market structure.\n\nWe have exchanges like Coinbase that likely fragment coins into millions of utxos. Furthemore, we have a mempool that can be congested with low sat/byte.\n\nScenario 1: BCash gets dump for Cash by the majority of coin owners.\n\nOutcome: BCash goes to 0 quickly. Normal market operations.\n\nScenario 2: BCash gets converted to BTC.  Markets become illiquid.\n\nOutcome: Coinbase needs to buy BTC from other exchanges. It does so, but it also has to fragment the coins into millions of utxo. This fragmentation causes mempool congestion. Transaction fees spike. Exchanges becomes illiquid.\n\nAt this point, a dark pool can be set up, so exchanges can trade coins directly to one another with an IOU, once mempool congestion subsides, But all exchanges are quickly short on coin, so it's not viable.\n\nThe other path is for prices to perceptibly drop so ppl sell coins, putting it into the system, for cash.\nThe consequence of this is that exchanges have to recombine the millions of utxo to fulfill the BTC-> cash transaction, which can cost more than fragmenting, and puts more strain on the mempool, making the system more illiquid. Thus exchanges can become insolvent, as funds are drained to recombine utxos, if they weren't allowed to delay fiat transfers.\n\nHere's the point. The recent crash occured when BCash was allowed to trade for a few hours. When Coinbase allows BCash to be sold again, that's millions of coins that can be dumped, and converted into BTC, hence millions of BTC that need to be in the system. Which implies that it'll be **an order of magnitude worse** then what has happened these last few days.\n\nThey'll likely have to suspend trades after a few hours again.\n\nThere is no quick fix because this is a design flaw in the market structure. ie, if exchanges do fragment into millions of utxos. Every introduction of a new coin on a big exchange risks this systemic outcome.\n\nThe only fix is to never allow BCash to be traded. **It must become a stranded asset.**\n\n**Note**: Ppl pulling coins into hardware wallets will exasterbate this systemic risk. However, exchanges mediate this by delaying the wallet to wallet transfer.\n\n\n**Note2**:  Ironically, another fix is to have a central reserve of bitcoins held by a central authority to inject into the system when it becomes illiquid, much like a Central Bank.",

Bitcoin is weathering the BCH bullshit with coinbase and gdax. Overall in this month, we're still up 5k from hitting the 10k mark. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. It's gonna go up, it's gonna go down.\n> \n> \n\nWe are in it together mate, we have survived, and panic sells are common, depends on your risk appetite... so HODL whatever is left and look for dip, if there are significant ones.... I don't forsee a big drop any soon, but I may be wrong !!",

True, I don't know if the bobble has burst yet (or are we just in another small 30% dip) but I think it's time for another 80% crash. We haven't had one since the 1000 to 200 crash.",

Every few seconds a new market buy is placed. I'm not certain but I think the reverse is also happening where every few seconds there are bots placing market sells on Bitcoin. \n\nIn the past they tried using buy walls to pump up the price of BCash and sell walls to hold down the price of Bitcoin, but I think they realized that market buys and sells would be more effective since people were eating through the walls. \n\nAnyway I don't like it one bit and I think everyone should be worried that BCH has been hovering around 0.2 BTC for days now. I have no doubts that Roger Vermin and his army will launch another attack on BTC in the coming weeks/months and each time they may get a little closer to the flippening. \n\nI think the extra volume you are seeing is due to these bots.

I also don't like how the Bcash guy acts when he's being interviewed. It is unprofessional. I don't want to invest in a crypto where that kind of attitude is brought to the development table. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4OlPDXqoz0\n\nI bought bitcoin to make a return on my investment. But after I did some research and found out what bitcoin stood for and how it can actually help create a decentralized financial system to everyone in the world, i'm here to stay. \n\nedit* lol, was typing this up, then couldn't comment on it cuz of the lock.",

PayPal has already been invented, and don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for such a service.  I guess bcash is preferable to PayPal at least!\n\nBcash goes down a road that diminishes bitcoin's most important feature, and does so in a way that is underhand and undemocratic.  \n\nHigh fees are a necessary growing pain, as will be (attempted) regulation further down the road.",

Only the person who owns the private key of the receiving address has access to the Bitcoin received in the transaction. If you are the one who receives the Bitcoin in this transaction, you are the owner as long as you have both the public and private keys of the address. The public and private keys can be exported into hashes that you can print on paper. As long as you hold the paper, you can import your private keys into a new wallet and the balance of your Bitcoin will be available to you.",

            "Text": "No one can tell you how much to invest. It depends on a number of variables. How old are you? How tolerant are you of stress/losing money? What are your expenses? What\u2019s your income? Do you have dependents or others who rely on you? Et cetera. \n\nAs a very general rule of thumb, the younger an investor is, the greater the percentage they can/should invest in higher risk investments. This is simply because as you get older, you have less time to save for retirement and less time to recover your losses. \n\nIf you have a wife and children, you should also consider their well-being and ask yourself if you should really be gambling on a highly speculative investment. No matter how much faith you may have in Bitcoin\u2019s future, no one can predict with total certainty where it\u2019s price will be in a week... much less in a month or a year. \n\nBottom-line: Invest no more than you can stand to lose. You should mentally prepare yourself to lose it, the moment you commit to investing it. I have enormous faith in BTC\u2019s future, but I still make every decision on the assumption that I\u2019ll never see the money again. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t even view it as an investment. If you believe in the concept, then think of it as money donated toward helping BTC succeed. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and be rewarded with a return in your investment... but it isn\u2019t intended as an investment vehicle, and IMHO anyone investing in it shouldn\u2019t approach it as such. Invest in the concept and the technology because you believe in a better system... not because you want to get rich. If you do make money, that\u2019s awesome. If you don\u2019t, then you can feel good that you were a part of a movement and furthered the technology.  ",

You can use 10 different wallets and if you restore access using seed words/private keys, all 10 wallets will display the same amount since they are all on the same access key.

But if anything that just makes it worse and even more unreliable. \n\nThe only thing that makes Fiat money appear more reliable is the population of trust in it. Currency is only worth anything proportionate to the amount of trust people have in it. Trust accumulates and eventually frameworks of accessibility will be established. Right now the silly Legibility and wildly fluctuating prices seem crazy but that\u2019s only because we\u2019re seeing it from or in relation to another currency as opposed to from within the currency itself.

I remember there was one interview about a record exec talking about how Steve Jobs came into a board meeting once and said \u201cyou guys have had your heads up your asses for too long\u201d in relation to the advent of online music. Whilst everyone was more interested in distancing themselves for it, Jobs pivoted and subsequently leveraged their collective nativity towards his favor. Created iTunes, negotiated absurdly cheap licencing deal and the rest is history! \n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t believe or see the potential in crypto then fine! More opportunity for us! ",

Each time people will be more reluctant to see cryptos as a pump and dump money making scheme and will be more likely to only put money into it so they can actually use it for transactions. By this point the usuability of cryptos will also be very good with lots of different companies and services accepting it. The next couple of years will be the time to make money out of it. Beyond that it will become more like a true currency. ",

This could be due to a lot of bot-trading, but I wouldn't exclude the possibility that a few big institutional investors create some panic to buy in cheaper. With say 50 million you can make big swings in the order books. We don't have any safety measures in the crypto world and a lot of things that are illegal in the stock market are allowed here.

            "Text": "The original project was to get enough consensus and not only \"fork\" the Bitcoin blockchain, but to \"upgrade\" it. The fork in that case would be that the main Bitcoin blockchain would be BTC and the few people that didn't want to do this would be some sort of Bitcoin Classic. From there, it turns out that most exchanges wanted to call this \"upgrade\" B2X and keep the Bitcoin Classic as BTC. That's where everything fell apart..\n\nIn this case, I believe that B2X is just a small fork by a couple of people, but they don't have consensus from node runners and miners to \"upgrade\" the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.  So in other words, just another shitcoin being born without much support.",

            "Text": "Indeed for a few weeks bitcoin dropped while altcoins surged. But this is not that common. The reason was that Bitcoin gained a lot in October and November because of the forks (bitcoin gold and the canceled segwit 2x) and all the media attention (including announcement of the futures trading). In that period alts lost about 40% of their value relative to bitcoin. But they rebounded eventually. What I do notice though, which is in line with your ideas, is that certain drops look coordinated. And I would also say that the alts usually don't rebound that quickly. Usually the Bitcoin dominance becomes higher in correction periods and this time not so much. So indeed it could be that these sophistecated traders use the altcoins very efficiently at the way up. Interesting, food for thought!",

Therefor, only people with serious cash and investment can mine with any sort of profit, eliminating the mom and pop mining operations. It would be reducing the amount of miners, hence making it more centralized. Then there's also the issue of transferring that bigger block size to the entire network. Which takes more time and network resources to distribute and check. \nSo increasing the block size would basically kick out lots of people who are currently playing the game. \n\nThere's also another thing that's something like, if bitcoin were to handle as many transactions as Visa, the block size would have to be like 1gig, or something like that. So, simply increasing the block size, won't solve the bigger issues. ",

No one can honestly say (even though they might believe it) whether crypto will start to produce real value for anyone but speculators in the future. In five years from now I doubt the price of Ether is going to go up because Vitalik wrote the latest type of smart contract (or whatever) if no one can use Ethereum (or Bitcoin or Bcash) for anything but speculation.

Without a centralized overseer, high maintaince cost (in a centralized perspective, as costs are distributed between all participants) and much much more.\n\nBlockchain is about using our massive global network to keep track of the TRUTH, truth in a pragmatic not philosophical way.

            "Text": "I've been to New York City a couple times. Not sure if you have. One of the things that blew me away about that city was the financial district. It's an amazing sight. The massive buildings, the massive wealth. An incredible amount of money has gone into that place which supports many people who are by and large the wealthiest people in the world. Yet nothing is made there. There are no factories. Very little is done there that you could definitively say is \"real value for the economy\". Yet there it is. The greatest concentration of wealth in the world... right there where nothing is actually created other than \"financial products\" which amount to pushing paper around.\n\nI believe that crypto is the answer for that. It is the equivalent of the factory automation for the financial industry. That has value, and that's why people like me have invested in it.",

Then another 0.25 on the next one... and then the big one of 0.5 BTC at the lowest buy point. It's hard to determine bottoms or what price will do, but this way I \"average down\" my position.

Lightning Network is being built for that, given the current circumstances.\n\nLook, just like you there's a lot of people that is a sceptic about bitcoin, and it's understandable and healthy. But just think that people felt the same way about the internet a decades ago. In theory internet allow us to share data, and that's about it, with time we've managed to find thousand of cool and profitable applications of the internet, and that's the internet we know today.\n\n With Bitcoin and crytpocurrencies in general is the same story. Right now we only have a theory, features and a vague idea of how the world could be if bitcoin is massively implemented in our economy. \n\nThe only thing I DO know is that Bitcoin (and crytpocurrencies in general) is simply way to good to simply be a passing hype. The world is changing with this crypto revolution, you could either be a part of it, or stay away, it's not stopping for any of us.",

There's a black market for EVERYTHING, even diapers and coffee, so you can imagine there's one for Bitcoin, with normal people acting as exchanges, buying and selling btc whener they need to. Localbitcoins is huge in Venezuela, and peer to peer transactions in general are widely used.\n\nHowever this is not the case for the majority of the population. most Venezuelans are very very poor, with little or no access to an internet connection. The real Venezuelan Bitcoin users are either the agonizing middle class or the corrupt machinery of the military and the central government.",

But their liquidity is terrible since Mugabe is gone and they're in a crisis about it. So they could use something like that, but without the $30 fees obviously lol. \n\nThey wait for days to get $50 out of the bank right now (daily limit but often can't get it, even though they have money in the bank). They have ecocash and other options but the fees are too high. Many shops have 5 different pricing tiers based on how you pay for something. Cash is really hard to get ahold of there. \n\nA stable crypto that is easy to use with very low fees would be great for them imo. ",

            "Text": "I'm a politologist so I guess I studied to answer this question.\n\nGoing into socialism vs capitalism would be a long and difficult endeavour, as arguments are simply unlimited for both sides. The ultimate conclusion being that it depends a lot more of how it is applied in practice, than how good it sounds in theory.\n\nRegarding the last question, I can safely say Venezuela is indeed a state capitalism. I, as many Venezuelans, tend to willfully misuse the term because the goverment self describe themselves as socialist and communist. Inevitably we have grown to hate communist and socialist, and surely, most actions and policies taken by the goverment follow a strict socialist way of looking at things, naming things and doing things.  However, it would be false to say that Venezuela is a socialist or worse, a communist country, as there's absolutely no descentralization of power, there's a political incentive rather than a economical incentive in the government's doing. There's no heavy investment in social services like health and housing... And I could keep on forever.\n\nI'm amused by your interest in Venezuela and it's awesome to know that is people trying to figure our mess out. Short story, Venezuela is certainly state capitalism, as the figure of state and goverment have been simply merged, and the acting goverment simply acts whenever it feels like, wherever it feels like and with how much money and manpower it needs like (even making up laws deliberately whenever it is needed), like a big fat billionaire of wallstreet with unlimited political power would. It's funny how extremely different ideas, sometimes look so similar :)",
