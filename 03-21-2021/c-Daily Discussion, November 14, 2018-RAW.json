It's not simply that Bitcoin's ambitions are good; but that the incentive systems setup that secure the network are elegant and revolutionary.\n\nIf you understand this experiment you understand that it has the potential to fail. If it didn't have the potential to fail the price would already be millions per coin.\n\n\nAll that said I think Bitcoin is here for the long haul. How low might it go? I don't know ; but the lower it is the more you can buy. The lower it is, the easier it is for the 1800 coins mined per day to get absorbed by the market.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin prices can be manipulated by Whales; in the longer terms Bitcoin price is set by the market. It can only be kept up or down against the general trend for so long.\n\nIf Bitcoin goes down and stays down; that means this whole year of the price holding in the $6000's didn't really reflect the demand of the market. If thats the case the it was inevitable for the price to come down to sustainable reality.\n\nOn the other hand if the market throughout 2018 wasn't artificially kept up; that means that 1800 coins were being bought at market rate per day, plus those still selling their profits from the 2000% bull run.\n\nIf thats the case; then we'll see the market quickly take the price back to a higher equilibrium as buyers overwhelm sellers.\n\nThis market is still the wild west and it could do anything. That means we could still drop another 90%+ or go on a massive run. If you're throwing up over the possibility of losing it all; sell now. \n\nOtherwise butter your popcorn and enjoy the show.\n\n\n\n",

So now the price will bobble around for awhile until the SEC rejects the ETFs again.

HODL\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen you bought at $9,897 and couldn\u2019t believe your luck that you could still get some below $10k. \u201cWoohoo! Under $10k baby!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPrice drops to $8k and you start feverishly buying thinking you may never get a better chance again. \u201cThis thing is gonna fly soon again!!!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPrice drops to $7k.  \u201cUh oh. What\u2019s going on? Why isn\u2019t it going up yet?  Maybe I should just wait to buy more later.   Hmm or should I sell?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPrice drops to $6k. \u201cOH SHIT!!! THE SKY IS FALLING!  WE ARE ALL DOOMED! TIME TO SELL!!!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJune 29, 2018 bitcoin falls to $5,835.75.  \u201cSo glad I sold, now I can just sit back and watch in safety\u201d \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMeanwhile the smart money loads up.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJuly 25, 2018 bitcoin reaches $8,416.87.  \u201cBull run finally starting baby. Time to buy MOAR!!!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the lesson here is that short term price fluctuations are meaningless. The best time to buy is when most others have lost all hope.  Smart people bought more when the price was just $5.8k, while the Untrue Hodler already sold. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBitcoin has nearly a 10 year track record of increasing over the long term. There are many positive developments happening with bitcoin in the next few months into 2019 and the Halvening isn\u2019t that far away either (2020).  If you buy and HODL for years, you will be glad you did. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[- Hopium Time Archives -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/) ",

We dont even know how to store btc without it being stolen, we dont know how to use it without screwing something up. Imagine giving someone that had been incarcerated for the last 50 years a smart phone. They would have the same reaction and say the internet is stupid and it has no place in the future. But when they finally realize how to use it they will say its the best thing ever. So the same applies to BTC, we need to learn how to use it.  ",

From 7000 to 20.000 = average joe, who will not come back. 4 percent of western world has already invested in btc, which is a huge proportion for a speculative asset, considering the fact btc will never become a currency (at least not in the coming 50 years). I'm sure gold doesn't reach 4 percent. The fact that big institutional investors never were interested in crypto and will not be interested in crypto for the coming years, means we have a problem. Cause if average joe doesn't come back and institutional investors don't want to invest in crypto, where will new money come from? Only possibility left is from current investors, but they already lost too much money. You need extremely good news to get more money out of your pockets.",

I understand that markets have ups and downs and I've been in this for a year now. I've seen my investment drop 60%. I need to know when to call it and just dump. Can anyone give me a plausible reason to stay in? Not just HODL IF YOU CARE!!! No.  There needs to be a reason. I want to believe in this. But I'm losing so much money. What are valid reasons this can turn around? Why is Bitcoin so valuable that it'll reach 100,000 as one poster said? I'd just be happy if it came back up to 10,000. Thanks. ",

            "Text": "It\u2019s so troubling that Bitcoin is only being used as an asset by the whales and not a viable form of currency as intended by Satoshi. The amount of volatility is totally related to its value as an asset. Imagine if the dollar could lose value like that in a single day. It certainly can especially if the Venezuelan bolivar can fall so hard to the point its worthless. How many of you have more confidence in Bitcoin value over USD value? The USD currency has been around for over 240 years. Bitcoin has been around 8 years. The bolivar was around for nearly 130 years before it failed. This is why I have trouble confiding in any currency and believe more in finite commodities like gold, diamond and silver. Bitcoin was always a finite cryptocurrency until it was hard forked into Bitcoin Cash. Hard forks were never in Satoshi\u2019s vision. Now, they\u2019re appearing everywhere like spam email. I don\u2019t know if Bitcoin will experience mass adoption in our lifetime. But, I do believe in digital technology being the future and we are still at the infant stages of cryptocurrency similar to internet in the 90s. I can most certainly see Bitcoin hitting $100K by 2025 or the next major bull run. But, volatility continues to be Bitcoin\u2019s biggest hurdle and also what keeps institutional money out like a moat. The whales will never give up their stakehold in Bitcoin because they are the biggest HODLers, sold on its long-term potential. But, if they suddenly give up on BTC after a decade of inactivity, it\u2019s not far-fetched BTC could fall below $1K. Anything is possible.",

I have studied crypto, but I have never owned any; however, I've made and lost enough $ from other investments/speculations to know how it feels.  Actually, I've never lost sleep over loses or bets.  I usually have to remind myself in the morning what my positions were.  My attitude is that it is only $, and other things are more important.  As long as you are able bodied, you can earn a living the old fashioned way.\n\nMany are wondering if they should sell in the midst of this extended down turn.  The best general advice is that you should hold (hold, never hodl), if the reasons for taking the position are still valid.    If you had no position, would you take one now?  If the answer is \"no\", you should get out. If the answer is \"yes\", then keep the position.\n\n4 or 5 years ago I first took a look at bitcoin.   I spent quite a bit of time on it, even programming some of the cryptography from scratch to teach myself how it worked.  I was very close to buying $5k of it at around $20 a coin.  I decided not to because I saw flaws in it that made me doubt its long term future.  I was that close to having $5M, well it'd be $1.4M now...  I am not taking a position now because the reasons I didn't take a position 4 years ago are still valid.  I am not surprised it is going down.  I expected it to collapse from $100.",

I know most certainly that John McAfee will never eat his dick and that was an obvious hyperbole because he\u2019s a psychopath. I find the bipolarism and emotions in this subreddit hilarious. One day, everybody\u2019s spirits are up when the whales decided to pump the market, and BitcoinAlways sounds like he\u2019s having an orgasm. Then on days like this, everyone\u2019s on suicide watch. That\u2019s because most Bitcoin investors have Stockholm syndrome. They get abused by whales activities, then forget about it just to experience it again. It cracks me up. Does that make me a bad person to laugh? If so, I\u2019m a bad person hahah.",

I absolutely hate people that think like you, that need some dumbass justification to make sense of today\u2019s madness as if Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuation/volatility has a clear explanation. It doesn\u2019t. The whales read all the market, limit and stop orders and they meticulously plan a pump and dump when it\u2019s most favorable to them. The hard fork had no effect on their decision to dump Bitcoin today. It\u2019s kinda like you taking a dump when it\u2019s most favorable to your bowel movements and nobody is using your most convenient toilet. Are you learning anything? Get your FUD about the hard fork the hell out of here. You clearly are incompetent.",

All the real benefits of a currency are supposed to happen then.\n\nThe gains are only part of the transitional phase in the meantime.

Its potential will decrease (as it's already been realized), and its volatility will decrease (more people in the space). *That's* when the stable store of value attribute kicks in. Furthermore, the lesser potential for gains, relatively stable price, significantly larger number of users, and completion of second layer solutions will lead to an economy where spending is more the norm. That doesn't make as much sense in this stage, however.\n\nThe point is not that I guarantee this will happen, though I suspect it will.

            "Text": "When the stock market sinks, so will crypto. \n\nIt's really dead technology. It's a lot like 3D Printing. When 3D printers came out, everyone went nuts. Makerspaces popped up everywhere, and industrial arts/makerspaces popped up in high schools and middle schools. Suddenly 3D printers got cheap from china (and a little sucky) so the entire market cooled. No new technology kept the maker movement going, and even the maker movement cooled. 3D printer sales now are almost dead and more and more shops are closing. If it's not digital, nobody wants it. If it's not a $2 app, it's of little value. \n\nBitcoin has hit a similar parabola. Everyone of consequence with money knows what it is or has heard of it. Either they bought and sold (like me) or bought and hold and got screwed. No new people will suddenly buy, which means the crypto fad is over. Banks won't use it for transactions because they make 3% on those card readers which is a lot of money. The system works and everyone makes money so nobody except the merchant wants it.",

This shit doesn't trend at all. Just flat nothing followed by fomo after the whales make their moves. I'm thinking of only trading actual currencies moving forward that at least have a fucking direction and reasons behind their moves that the public is able to follow. Crypto has way too much non-public info controlling price movement (whales controlling movement on their whims, insider trading at coinbase befor BAT listing, the bcash war..why would ANYONE want a currency that can be fought over / controlled by a handful of individuals or small groups?) \n\nI continue to believe that without regulation or some type of serious consequences then this space will be doomed to fail as rogue / wealthy / deceitful parties use these markets as their personal play-things.",

            "Text": "I've been in Bitcoin since 2013. I saw the price shoot up from $100 to over $1100 in a few months, then take years to recover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, 2018 feels a lot like the bear market of 2014. As everyone says, there's no guarantee patterns continue. But as someone who's weathered the storm before, I do think there's a lot to be learned from the past as well. Instead of getting swallowed up by your own mood swings, pay attention to everyone else's; that might give you some clues as to where we are in the hype cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the first half of 2014, the price had a lot of volatility, but steadily declined from about $1000 to $600. During this phase, everyone was optimistic this was just another waiting period for the next breakout. The first half of 2018 was very similar; the price moved with volatility but steadily down from $17000 to $9000. Like before, everyone was optimistic this was just a break between price rises.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the second half of 2014, volatility was lower, but the price eventually broke support at $600 and fell to $400. This is when the trolls started coming out of the woodwork proclaiming crypto is dead. As prices have fallen from $9000 to $6000 this year, trolls have once again infested the space, with surprisingly similar ratios to what we saw before. Meanwhile, in both cases, pundits went from \"I'm still bullish\" to mealy-mouthed \"it could go up, but it could go down too\" non-answers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015, as the price shot down one more time from $400 to $200, the pain, desperation, and trolling were out in full force. Forums were not a pretty sight. Concern trolling turned into outright mockery over people losing money. Honestly, I had to get away from it for a while too, and didn't talk about it in person anymore either. Here at the end of 2018, I suspect we're headed toward a similar trend; the move to $5500 might just be the beginning (a cycle proportional to the previous one would put the bottom around $3500-4000).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, who knows if this offers any insight for the future, but here's the rest of what happened before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first three quarters of 2015 were quiet, and really, just plain boring. While price drifted aimlessly between $200 and $300, participation in discussions was low. People either got bored or perhaps were just embarrassed to still be in the space, so trolls had no one to troll as well. Little did anyone know this was the absolute best time to buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuddenly there was a sharp uptick back to $400 in October. This wasn't really enough for optimism to set in, as there were already several false breakouts, though this was the strongest upward move since 2013.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, 2016 was actually the most interesting year, since it featured a steady bull market all year back to near $1000, without even much of a bumpy ride. The permabulls started getting more vocal again while the trolls retreated, but it still didn't seem there were many new people around yet. It's interesting to note that 2012 featured a similar steady bull run, but I wasn't around then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen 2017 happened, which everyone already knows about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; The hype cycle appears to consist of a year-long parabolic bull run, a year-long bear market (with moods declining from optimism to denial to pessimism, I think we're just entering the pessimism phase), a year of boredom, and a year of a steady bull run back to the previous ATH. Granted, it's not a large sample size, but this has been going on since 2012, and a four-year cycle makes perfect sense with Bitcoin's halving pattern. If the future turns out remotely similar, we're not looking at new highs until 2021, but the bottom might be in early next year.",

I\u2019ll have you know I bought bitcoin over 12 years ago, and I\u2019ve been involved in numerous cryptocurrency projects, and I have over 300 different tokens. I am a pro at HODLing and I\u2019m the top poster on the bitcoin forums. You are nothing to me but just another shitcoiner. I will buy the dips the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am buy the dip so you better prepare for the parabolic move up, maggot. The parabolic move that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your portfolio. You\u2019re fucking broke, kid. I can buy any token, anytime, and I can hold bags in over seven hundred shitcoins, and that\u2019s just with my poloniex wallets. Not only am I extensively rich from HODLing, but I have access to the latest information from Prabolic Trav before it even hits youtube and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable shitcoin wallet off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon your portfolio, maybe you would have held your fucking bitcoin. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over this market and you will drown in it. You\u2019re fucking broke, kiddo.",

Do you think the price will go up or stay at 6000? Now, let's assume 250 people want to step out. What do you think will happen with the price? Right, it will fall. Current situation: flat interest line, which means the amount of btc holders stays approximately the same over a longer period of time, which means interest level is stable. No matter what happens, the price won't fall below a certain level that corresponds with amount of investors that are interested in btc, unless a nuclear war or something like that breaks out. I hope people finally understand this simple fact. You can moan all you want and dismiss what i say, the price will bounce back to natural price level",

Crypto has more immediate problems. Actually, I like the idea of putting your wealth into physical things, like collectibles.  The few collectibles I bought, I hang on to for a long time (like most of my life), and they've all done well in value.  You do need a place to put them, and to keep them out of the way of kids and dogs, so nothing is perfect.  Owning a home has also done well for me, despite the crash.\n\nEconomic growth is the solution to the US debt problem, and many other problems.  Currently we have some decent economic growth.  But with the tilt towards socialism in this country, it is hard to see that continuing, but that is another story.",

Nobody except for Tom Lee is more wrong about BTC price predictions than you. And on a bloodshed day, you are so stubborn to still be defensive about your precious Bakkt. Fuck bakkt- we all know that was a ploy by the whales to generate interest in Bitcoin when it was very stagnant. No interest was generated so the whales finally decided to tank the old boy.

            "Text": "That's an interesting way to frame the question, because I think the ultimate goal is for it to *replace* your savings.\n\nWe live in a Plato's cave of an inflationary world. Inflation is so deeply ingrained in our financial mindset that it's hard to imagine a world in which it doesn't dominate. Sure, everyone always wants their assets to appreciate in any system regardless, but in an inflationary world, it's necessary for survival. So if a new system comes to replace that, do you really need everything to appreciate against it to survive?\n\nThe most illustrative example is retirement accounts. Why do people have retirement *investments* like 401k's instead of retirement *savings*? Most of these people have no idea how to trade the stock market, then there's added complications with taxes, fees, etc. The reason they do it is not because they genuinely seek to make money, though that's always nice, but rather because they don't want their retirement to lose value to inflation. That example has the most significant consequences with respect to inflation since retirement is saved for decades, but all investments must beat inflation to be considered good, and their real gain in value is less than it sounds also due to inflation.\n\nBitcoin's final form is a store of value, making it a new form of savings. While **a store of value is a downgrade from being an investment, it's an upgrade from the current form of savings**, since even the best CD rates that lock the funds away for years often don't beat inflation. This new form of savings will outperform traditional savings (as traditional savings don't store value) and be far simpler than traditional retirement accounts. Imagine bypassing all that 401k nonsense to defeat the artificial problem of inflation when all you have to do is just hold final-form Bitcoin to retain reliable value.\n\nThe question of how or why such a transition would happen is a tricky one, because I agree, transitioning from an investment asset to a savings one is a downgrade. As generally long-term bullish as I am on Bitcoin, I suspect it'll be a decade before we get to see how it actually unfolds, but here's my current thoughts on it.\n\nCrypto has always gone through hype cycles, as you know. These hype cycles though are generally not just greater fools chasing gains though; there's always been some new paradigm vision people also seem to be chasing in the process. Remember the \"blockchain\" boom? For a while, everyone thought blockchains would be everywhere so people invented all kinds of stupid stuff just so they could jam a makeshift blockchain in the middle somewhere to appease giddy investors. Their imaginations were way bigger than reality. Then people realized blockchains are just terribly inefficient databases, and the only space where the additional security is worth it is a decentralized monetary system which we already had. More recently, we had an altcoin hype bubble, where there were all sorts of useless coins massively outperforming Bitcoin and the other major cryptos.\n\nBlockchains and altcoins do have value, but the true discovery of that value occurs well after the hype bubble pops and things level out to an equilibrium.\n\nWe haven't had a true \"bitcoin is the next store of value\" kind of bubble yet. As I said, I'm guessing that's a decade away. I don't remember what it was calculated to be. Depending on how much of the savings/retirement/currency market it would take, it would end up something like $200-500k per coin. That's an unbelievable number to comprehend right now, but Bitcoin maximalists often arrive at much higher numbers, because they suspect it will take over all that and much more.\n\nTake the following numbers merely for the sake of illustration. Let's say the \"true\" long-term savings value of Bitcoin is $250k/coin. The way I think this would play out is that there would be one last hurrah bubble going way over this, say to $1M, because once again, people's imaginations are way bigger than reality. Then when it comes back down, it will become frustrating, then boring, and never return to the fun glory days of $1M that everyone will reminisce fondly about years later. It will just serve as a dull, but reliable long term store of value, as originally designed. Its widespread availability makes it viable as a currency (assuming second layer solutions for microtransactions continue to improve), and people find it OK to hold onto in the meantime because its value doesn't inflate away. However, maximalists won't see it getting quite as big as they thought, and investors will no longer see it as a viable investment.

However you don't set the value of the dollar first then export. As you sell your product overseas you are setting the value of the dollar. That increases the dollar price against the foreign currency. The market sets the dollar, the dollar does not set the market. \n\nSometimes speculators play in the currency market but that is dwarfed by the overall volume of goods and services traded internationally.",

When I'm feeling very sick of the daily grind, I also dream about vanlife, living on a sailboat, going 'survival mode' in the forest or - the latest idea - going on a perpetual trip with a bicycle.\n\nRight now I'm in a happy relationship and have immediate career plans but shit might change in an instant, very much like Bitcoin does sometimes.\n\nThe bottom line is that you are not alone, many people I've met feel alienated in today's society and wish to work less and enjoy the simple things in life more. Some need to run away (to come back later), but all of us need to come to grips with the world that we live in. Bikepacking might be just the experience to mellow you out.",

I'll probably take out 50% of both BCH and the fork when I find the price to be overbought and put it into ETH and ride the rest to parabolic levels or to 0.\n\nI find BCH to be one of the most speculative projects based on the team.

Bitcoin would have to be broken in some catastrophic way for it to disappear, and it is not broken. I have been through times like this and they pass. I personally buy a little more every time or I work a little harder at my job so that i don't have to sell because I needed the money. Bitcoin isn't dead, it will out live all of us reading this sub. Don't panic and do something else that you enjoy doing. Before long you will be a pro like some of us that have more experience dealing with these drops. Get some sleep.

            "Text": "Bitcoin solved an unsolved computer science problem known as the \"Byzantine General's problem\". Basically, until bitcoin, there was no way to send data between two computers who don't trust each other and know for sure said data wasn't manipulated in some way. That's the greatest innovation of this and where Bitcoin's intrinsic value lies. Decentralization is basically the term used to describe the nature of the network. Basically, there is no Central point of failure in the network because it's a public network of computers running the same bitcoin software and they all verify the transactions on their end to keep the network honest. Basically a room full of strangers with a camcorder on someone in the middle of the room for a record of what happened to think of it another way. It's not better than pay pal yet. You'll see the lightning network get talked about a lot here. Once that's done, it will theoretically be able to process wayyyy more transactions per second than pay pal. Also, more features are that there is a set amount of bitcoins and no single entity or government is in control of it. Hope that helps.",

            "Text": "Bitcoin can process the algorithm needed to mine better than the 500 most powerful supercomputers COMBINED! Also, the mining of Bitcoin is timed to be every 10 minutes or so. If Bitcoins start to get mines faster, the difficulty of the algorithms(hashing) goes up until it's ten minutes again. also, bitcoin uses like a million dollars of electricity a day mining Bitcoin. So you'd essentially have to pay for that only to have difficulty turned up and wait ten minutes for your bitcoins. Plus, supercomputers aren't optimized to process the kinds of math the mining rigs are optimized for. Sure, the government could ban it. But they could still be used by anyone. Look at what happened with illegal music downloading. It forced the music industry to restructure to a streaming format to compete because the government couldn't stop p2p networks. P2p networks are decentralized, no single point of failure. Also, adversarial governments could promote bitcoin and the U.S. would only lose out of bitcoins because of it. Also, our software is not Rock solid. That's why we have malware, hacks, identity theft and teams of people trying to make your bank transactions safe. Bitcoin is safe, cheap, out of the hands of the government (like gold) and solves the Byzantine General's problem. It's beautiful.",
