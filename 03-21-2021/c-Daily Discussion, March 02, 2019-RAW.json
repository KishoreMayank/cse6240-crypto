The whales are greedy and will always look to bait new money to investing in Bitcoin. That\u2019s why there is no way Bitcoin will hang around the $3400-$4200 range the whole year. It could dip to $1900 or rise up to $6000 before falling back into the $3400-$4200 range. But, there is no way it will remain in this $800 range for 365 days. That would be a relatively unprecedented range for Bitcoin and is the least of possibilities. I personally believe Bitcoin will hit both $1900 and $6000 in this same year.",

Their only chance of obtaining \u00a310k in a reasonable amount of time is to gamble it on BTC (I am just using \u00a310k as an example and not necessarily think \u00a32.6k -> \u00a310k is possible).",

If the poster were to invest in BTC, odds are they would probably lose that money but if they had no income, their only way of achieving their savings goal is to gamble on the off chance BTC does well. What is better a 0% chance or a 10% chance to achieve their goal? I probably should have mentioned it also depends on how much the poster needs. If it is only something small, like a $100, keep it in a savings account. I also think you are missing context. The advice I am giving is for someone with a job and a saving goal because just accumulating through income is far more likely to succeed. Your advice is more suited for someone with no saving goal in mind.",
