            "Text": "Make your own decisions. I repeat, do not listen to ANYONE if they think its going to 8.5K then to 5K or they think its going to 11K... etc.. \n\nIt is your own money. Invest wisely, do not FOMO into anything. Stay away from TradingView opinions. MagicPoopCannon is an example that \"helped saved\"  thousands away from the 6.6K BTC to 9.5K BTC rise.\n\nYou make the call. Your profit margins are entirely yours. $100 USD profit or $1000 USD, or $100,000 USD, whatever your level of risk suits you best and makes you feel COMFORTABLE. **WHen you trade outside of your comfort zone, you make mistakes.**\n\nAlso, have a plan of when the price of BTC goes to 11K. Have a plan when the price of BTC goes to 5K. What alts do you want. What does your exit strategy look like? Before you buy, always have an exit plan and consider all possibilities. Like i said before when you trade with a smaller stack, you are alot more comfortable to make bolder decisions. You don't have to **kill it** on each and every trade. You just have to protect your capitol, and sometimes that means cutting losses. In other words, trade gently, but if you are not trading now, start coming up with plans on what you want to do!\n\nEdit: also learn to spot trends. If you miss out on a run , there's always a retracement. Every single damn day is an opportunity. Just because the price went +15% doesn't mean you screwed up. It means that you have to keep looking and scouting. In particular look how bull runs and bear dumps look like, and what they look like before, during, and after. There are stages to these things and you can spot them over time with a few months of practice. Don't even invest. Just watch the charts and learn. Put in $20 just to test. Try to turn your $20 into $25. You do not have to kill it on every trade.\n\nFor example. I missed out on the run from 9250 to 9377 just  now. I sold at even. I do not panic nor do i fomo, or regret selling at around my buy-in price. My goal was to cash out some alts and go back to fiat. I know there is  a retracement opportunity, and even if you miss one retracement, there are more coming. Each one with its own characteristics.\n\nHere's a simple \"trick\". Set a stop buy that anticipates retracement because #1 you don't have to commit to anything, and you control the buy in price after its proven its strength. As an example you set a stop buy of BTC at 8950  after BTC goes to 9075. There's also shapes you need to recognize, flag, triangles, and of course, the shape of bull runs and bear drops. Runs / Drops occassionally look like vertical lines, but more often, they are bubbles along the way. Lower circles ('soggy bottoms') and upper circles  ('top bubbles') appear on movement up and down, and there are thus 4 types \n\n* lower circles + price up = strong movement \n* lower circles + price down = descending but keep an eye to buy soon \n* upper circles + price up = dampening movment upwards.. look to sell soon\n* upper circles + price down = possible whale movement downwards! \n\nAlso of course look for pre-volume pump (high volume , relatively small price movement).. Tons and tons of things you can learn every day.",

This is why the SEC won't approve a bitcoin etf, and shouldn't;  even with all this liquidity there are too many big players capable of swinging the price dramatically at whim.  So what is it today?  A whale selling another 50 million.  Hedge fund guys selling bitcoin to drop the price before the expiration of their futures contracts.  Chinese miners and Ver dumping bitcoin when its down to pump up the  bcash price before it forks, which, by the way, is not going to air-drop any free coins like bitcoin forks did.",

Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/\n\nHaving recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.\n\nThe cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).\n\nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.\n\nA bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.\n\nView\n**The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**",

            "Text": "Sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I have a technical question about bitcoin. Does anyone know whats the reasoning behind the design choice of having fees that aren't fixed price for transactions? From what I see by not keeping them fixed it creates the problem of potentially delaying a transaction forever and I can't really see any advantages. It drives miners to choose the transactions with higher fees which in turn creates a \"unfair\" system as transactions aren't ordered in creation time. What would be the disadvantages of having fixed fees and having the mempool \"ordered\" with miners processing transactions in order? Is giving users the choice of paying higher fees to get their transaction processed faster a good enough advantage over fixed fees with ordered transactions?\n\nEdit: I speak about order a lot, but even if we don't order it, is fixing fees and making every transaction have the same chance to be processed a bad thing? Why do we want to give the miners the ability to choose which transactions to put on the block?",

Bitcoin went up from 6.6k to 9.7k, then it recently fell down to 8.7k - 8.8k, with most major alts mirroring its price movement fairly well. I guess down depends on when you bought in. For me it's still up about 28-30%.\n\nSure, there have been a tough sell pressure from some whales since the price reached 9.7k. On the flip side, other whales, combined with some bulls have defended the 8.7-8.8k price range for a while in spite of heavy pressure. There are many interests at play in the market.",

While pursuing sideways trading I wouldn't be surprised if bulls keep selling high and buying back low repeatedly in order to increase liquidity for further advances. They are investors and traders as well and need to make up for the cost of protecting price ranges.\n\nPersonally I appreciate the work of the bulls, they have endured a tough sell pressure lately and they also cannot risk to overextend themselves for the long run. So no, I don't consider bulls sitting on their arses.",

The storage space on the great immutable blockchain is intended for transactions but it would be misused for all kinds of other stuff. We saw that throughout the history of computing: the more space became available, the more it was used. Microsoft Word used to fit on a floppy disk, now it uses hundreds of MB of data.\n\nIf blocks were larger, people would find ways to fill them up somehow. Maybe some idiotic exchanges would start adding a scan of your ID attached to every transaction... because that would solve them some AML issues and with large blocks they could (I know it\u2019s stupid... but you never know). I can\u2019t predict how things will evolve, but historically more space always led it to be used up somehow.\n\nTransactions must have a price or we would succumb to spam or huge amounts of data.",

Transactions to multiple addresses are larger in size than 1 to 1.\n\nIf a transaction doesn't get picked up by miners because of a low fee, you can create a new transaction to the same address with a higher fee and the miners will most likely combine them to mine at the same time.\n\nGood questions.",
