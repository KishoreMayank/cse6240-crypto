            "Text": "Found out a co-worker has been a Bitcoin \"Trader\" since early 2016.  He was talking about something like \"I'm a crypto-trader-enthusiast,\" only in the space to make USD profit.\n\nHe has no clue how Bitcoin works.  He was shilling \"crypto\" to co-workers, and Hard forks came up.  He told them something similar to what has been in many news articles about Bitcoin forks, namely that Bitcoin forks are like \"Dividends and they increase the total supply of Bitcoin so Bitcoin isn't actually very scarce\"\n\nI interrupted and said that all hard forks were, were incompatible software changes with the rest of the original network.\n\nAnd he replied that \"Bitcoin isn't software,\" something about \"its created by the miners,\" He said something really stupid about what alt-coins were, I can't even remember what it was.   ???\n\nI don't even know what he was trying to say, made no sense.  How can you be in this space for 2 years~ and not  even know how it all works.\n\nI gave up a couple years ago trying to educate family and friends about Bitcoin\n\nNew people only care about making money :(",

I try to keep bitcoin at 6% of my net worth and generally don't sell unless it exceeds 12% during my quarterly rebalancing targets.  I've sold bitcoin 3 times in 5.5 years -- at $900, $3300 and in the $18,000 range.  \n\nSo every week I buy a small amount, typically around $125 average.  I retired 3 years ago at age 41 and have been buying $125 a week as usual, but as of last quarter (ending March 31, 2018) I realized my passive income is about double what I expected, so I am doubling my bitcoin purchases to $250 a week, every week.\n\nI am not living off of bitcoin profits, I just want to acquire more.  \n\nSince most people on this sub don't even have $100 in BTC, there's no point in wanting it to keep going up if you want to acquire more.\n\n$5000 would be nice right now.",

And the more people get burnt in this bubble pop, the harder of a time bitcoin will have to come up again. \n\nBecause not everybody FOMOing in now will stay and hodl. Most people will pull out when they start losing. They will take their 5% or 10% loss, walk away and never look back. Yeah, that's good for bitcoin /s\n\nSo I think people should also know my pessimistic views. And here is what I think: bitcoin can as easily fall under 7k again as it can continue up and test 11.6k again. \n\nNow downvote me, I am used to it. Remember March 4, BTC at 11500?
