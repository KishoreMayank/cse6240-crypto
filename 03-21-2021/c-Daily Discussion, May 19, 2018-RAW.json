If so, would I be charged the conversion fees to usd as well?\n\nIs there any alternative to this to save fees?\n\nI\u2019m trying to avoid the high banking fees that incur while transferring money internationally.\n\nThank you",

You need to first fund your account which will take some time but once you get into coinbase, I would suggest going through GDAX to buy or sell using limit orders. I generate day trading profits through GDAX using limit orders and then transfer those profits over to a coinbase wallet and have that wallet hooked up to a debit card I can use anywhere.... essentially buying things with bitcoin.",

You think the merchant doesn\u2019t pass those extra fees onto the customers through higher prices?  Of course they do.  It used to be obvious when buying gas.  Now many have same price cash/credit advertising. Doesn\u2019t matter since everyone pays more. Cash users end up subsidizing credit users.    \n\nCrypto fees will become more and more competitive with credit card fees and as more people switch to paying with crypto, prices of goods  will adjust downwards accordingly.  Merchants may even offer discounts initially for crypto users.   Bright future ahead boys. ",
