As of when I'm writing this, the market price says 8815, but there aren't enough sellers at that price, so you'd have to buy up to 9000 and would be buying 1117.6 BTC.  So you've spent 10 million and raised the price $200.  This would be noticed, but probably wouldn't greatly affect the market.  Also factored in to that was a 0.25% taker fee, which was $25,000.\n\nAt 1117.6 BTC per $10 million, your average price is about $8947.75. To make 1% profit you need to sell for an average of 9059.60 BTC/USD.  \n\nNow let's assume you already have the BTC on hand.  What would selling 1117.6 BTC do to the market right now?  Well again, you'd have to take a little less for each of them to fill enough orders to offload them all at once.  If you did that right now, you'd tank the price from 8815 to 8249.13, which is about a 600 drop in price.   Assuming the same levels, that means you'd need to wait until the price of bitcoin raised to nearly 9660 to sell your coins at a 1% profit.  You'd have to do it quickly, because this would definitely be noticed.\n\nEdit: fixed a couple of typos",

Look to the stars, Uranus is in Virgo.  Feel the bumps on your head - a good thought is coming.  Look at the lines on the palm of your hands - oh my, you'll be wealthy and then lose it all.\n\nYou have better odds predicting the outcome of professional sports.  TA sort of works in traditional investing.  This is not investing.  We are all day trading based upon the prevailing winds.  Some claim to be holding until the sun engulf the earth - but they are all really day trading (er, gambling).\n\nJust jump in.  I promise that the second you do, it will dip $100-200 and you'll be kicking yourself.  Then you'll jump in even more to feel better about the price - and it will dip again.  Then you will sell out of fear you cannot pay your mortgage - and it will rise $400... and you will scream at your computer and pound on the desk.\n\nThen you will repeat this all over again.",

The price is increasing because those people are seeing that when you buy bitcoin at $X, you can sell it at $X+Y. This increases FOMO, fear of missing out, so more people join in the market and drive the price up.\nIf you buy at $X and never sell, then you are doing nothing for contributing to the price. You are just someone who purchased bitcoin at $X. The guy/market who sold you that bitcoin has helped increase the price. SELLING FOR PROFIT increases the price, that's a fact.\n\n1. You BUY from someone who SELLs. Price increases a bit.\n2. You wait until you make profit or loss\n3. If you are at profit, you SELL to someone and increase the price a bit.\n4. You HODL if you are at loss, so you don't contribute to a price decrease.\n\nPlease stop telling people to HODL **if they are at a profit**. \"HOLD!\" is a good advice if the price is decreasing. If it's increasing, you keep buying and selling for profit, and the whole market goes up along with your profits.",

In your scenario you have the 8K sold at 9K with 1K profit, you add 1K, buy at 10K and then another 1K profit, add 1K, buy at 12K and then another 1K profit at 13K.  So essentially you've added 2K to your investment and made 3K profit, so 10K invested = 3K profit at 13K total.  If you didn't buy and sell your 8K would have made 5K profit at 13K.  That's a 62.5% return vs a 30% return.  So you're saying that the big whales in the market prefer a 30% return over a 62.5% return on investment? ",

Let's say everyone wanted to buy but all the exchanges were down and nobody could buy a bitcoin.  The price would go up without a single trade.  It's like new generation console releases at Christmas time.  The limited supply drives the price up.  The fundamental principal of economics is the supply, demand, and price relationship.  You say you're an economics professor but seem to not understand supply and demand.  You're premise of selling makes the price go up is misinformed.  A bunch of people buying when there are fewer selling is what makes the price go up.  It's a pressure system where the flow is dictated by supply and demand.",

I looked at your post history and noticed that you have a history of thinking you are very smart and insulting people who you either disagree with or people who you think you are smarter than.  Looking at your post history put things into context for me.  You've told at least three people that they have no understanding of how markets work & all three of those people simply explained the basic principals of supply and demand.  It's frustrating at first to have someone say \"I'm a really smart person, go read a book, you have no clue about anything\" but to then look at their post history and see every comment is down-voted is a bit of a relief.",

It's not like people have vastly different educations or knowledge.\n\nYou posted in all of my history, you never were able to produce a counter-argument in any of those. You just said I'm a jerk. I jerk around ignorant people like you who had no idea what they are talking about. And I don't care if I'm downvoted. I write the truth, people don't like to be corrected, they become bigger jerks and start attacking my history one by one. They never find any incorrect information though.\n\nYou aren't the first do call me a jerk, you aren't the first person whom I'm smarter than. You don't want to learn from me because you think I'm a jerk, your loss.\n\nI already made profit during last bitcoin crash from $16k to $8k. Knowing when to sell and buy makes you profit. You don't need to believe that I made a profit, you don't need to believe I'm telling the truth, you don't need to like me at all. Just try to realize people can be smarter or more educated than you. Those people can be jerks too. You'll meet successful jerks all the time in your life. They aren't actually jerks, they just don't try to win your love.",

You, however, inject vitriol into all your statements (for example, \"with their pocket money they got from their mommies\".  Here, I'll put some of my counter arguments in one place for you:\n\nThis makes no sense. You can't keep buying and selling while something goes up in price. You can only sell once. Once you've done that you'll be buying at a higher price than you sold and therefore not profiting.\n\nThe bitcoin doesn't know if you are selling at a profit or a loss. A sell has an effect, a buy has an effect, the conditions of each has no bearing.\n\nNope. Each sell and buy negated each other as far as the effect on the market goes. What I said is you can't sell and buy as the price of something goes up and make more money. You've lost money in comparison to someone who didn't sell.\n\nNow, you say you've avoided price drops. That's not a strategy. You buy when it drops and sell when it's high, not sell and buy while it's going up.\n\nWhile I've been polite to you, you've decided to identify yourself as an economics professor (even though you use k instead of K for one thousand) and have instructed me to go read a book and argue with you later. Simply because of your horrible attitude I am not interested in continuing this pointless discussion.\n\nLet's say everyone sold at once and nobody wanted to buy. The price would go to 0 without a single trade. Let's say everyone wanted to buy but all the exchanges were down and nobody could buy a bitcoin. The price would go up without a single trade. It's like new generation console releases at Christmas time. The limited supply drives the price up. The fundamental principal of economics is the supply, demand, and price relationship. You say you're an economics professor but seem to not understand supply and demand. You're premise of selling makes the price go up is misinformed. A bunch of people buying when there are fewer selling is what makes the price go up. It's a pressure system where the flow is dictated by supply and demand.\n\nYou see here how the value of your time goes up due to the limited supply? That's kinda like how markets work.\n\nSoftware acceleration is basically a GPU emulator, while hardware acceleration uses your GPU to decode the video. Since you need your basic system resources to use software acceleration, it has the potential to be less beneficial. These facts are mostly irrelevant when you are speaking of modern computing power, but it wasn't too long ago that you would absolutely have to have a gpu to do any video editing or display",

Holding means you are withdrawing yourself from the market and waiting to see what happens. You do not affect the price. Other people, who make the supply and demand will effect the price. That's what I'm saying. Supply affects price, but if you don't supply or demand, you aren't the one affecting the price. This is why \"HODL to increase the btc price\" is meaningless. You want to affect the price? You buy or sell.\n\n5. See number 4.",
