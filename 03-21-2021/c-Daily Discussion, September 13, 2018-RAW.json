Futures contract warehousing markets Starbucks Microsoft...its like the most pretentious sounding concept obfuscated with words most people don\u2019t understand but associating itself with legitimate reputable companies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s 100% bullshit. And what the hell is ICE anyway? Does anybody think Intercontinental Exchange? Noo I think of ICE as those government terrorists who harass Hispanics everyday. I hate shit like this.

Also, the battery health beta (under General > Battery > Battery Health Beta available on iOS 11 or higher) is totally inaccurate.

I have accomplished more than i had initially expected in life, and not just financially. All these accomplishments were a result of both intellectual achievement and requirement. So you can imagine how funny it is for me to read your comment on my IQ :). \n\nIt's people like yourself resorting to child like comments that is the reason the others in my investment group left this sub. I returned and simply continue to monitor this thread as well as hundreds of other resources. \nI won't humor you, but let me say that bakkt as a Bitcoin futures that allows participants to use actual bitcoin is exceptionally easy to understand. It's clear that the combination of physiological spinoff and the puchasing of actual BTC will be good for the space.\n\nNow the deal with MS and Starbucks is a little more convoluted and I will say many people I've explained it to over the past 3 weeks have found it less clear than the bakkt futures. But it isn't really that difficult. \nIn any case, you can say whatever you like about me, bakkt, and whatever else. Back when I bought my first few bitcoin I understood coding far more than the investment side of things, but in the past 6 years I have grown thick skin.",
