But the exception to this rule is when the news is about enablement of more money to flow into bitcoin through institutional enablement.\n\nEven if everyone is fully aware of this going to happen, the full impact will not price in prior to the event because you need money to price an asset and without the money, it just cannot get priced.\n\nTherein lies the importance of Bakkt and other institutional solutions that will make it easy for big money to flow in. No, this has not and cannot get baked in to the price now even if you know this is coming. ",

They are purposely keeping it vague. \nIf the Trump administration is so worried about China\u2019s power over the market, they should do what Germany did and not tax it till the market is mature enough. \n\nMiners in the USA get taxed at earned income tax rates which is approximately 30% depending on tax bracket. THAN, when they sell it, it gets taxed at capital gains rates!! \n\nWho would want to mine in the USA?!! No shit that China has 80% of the hash rate. If they truly believe it\u2019s a security risk having China control so much hashing power, don\u2019t tax it like that.  Either way, the government is going to be forced to make a decision when one of these mining farms in the USA takes the IRS to court. Than the courts will dictate the regulations. They are just \u201ckicking the can\u201d to another agency. They don\u2019t want bitcoin to mature and will do everything to hold it back till it\u2019s too late. Germany is the place to be. \n",

            "Text": "Surely the next major bull run will be predicated by an SEC-approved ETF. Because institutional money has not touched Bitcoin yet. Sure some institutional investors experimented with buying Bitcoin on an individual level but not on behalf an institution or bank. I remember when Bitcoin soared from like $13,500 to $20,000 in 8 days, all the crypto analysts claimed that institutional investors had finally entered Bitcoin. But, there was never any evidence of that because it was bullshit. Until Bitcoin is backed by major banks or an ETF is approved by an SEC, institutional investors will not touch Bitcoin with their clients money. It would be too reckless. What caused that spike in Dec. 2017 were the whales...that was their final pump, the pump of all pumps designed to bait inexperienced traders thinking it was surely going to go $25K and beyond. The whales did not know that the Bitcoin momentum continued beyond the new year since TV and radio commercials started advertising Bitcoin in Dec. Since February 2018, I have not seen a single Bitcoin TV ad. Then came all the negative news from Japan, South Korea and India which the whales identified as the start of a bear market. The whales used the announcement of Bitcoin ABC as an opportunity to perform a final crypto pump of the year and since then, it\u2019s been on a downward spiral now 5.5 months since the high in early May 2018. So what is ahead? I suspect one little pump by the end of the year before sudden doom beginning January 2019. Short-term future, Bitcoin looks very bleak. Long-term, I think it has the potential to hit $1M and beyond.",

Around 6000 is where it's going to stay for a couple of years, maybe it drops back to 5000 in 2019 due to declining interest.

That Bitcoin is still volatile and cannot remain in even 1K price range for a significant amount of time even though most Bitcoiners are so impatient and bored, that they want Bitcoin to move whether it\u2019s up or down just to see it\u2019s still kicking.

Particular plans that would jack the price of something they would obviously benefit from the most at its lowest price. No disrespect but it always seems hilarious when people on this sub talk as though they know what's going on (not you). I simply meant that over the next year, many will be in for a rude awakening if they think Bitcoin is simply going to stop rising as it has been for a decade. Bad year?
