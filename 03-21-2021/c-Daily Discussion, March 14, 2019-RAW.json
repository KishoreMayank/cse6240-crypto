            "Text": "Hi everybody. I'm pretty paranoid about the government knowing I have crypto and I want to keep adding to my stack without them knowing. I got in early 2017 luckily through a friend who I gave cash for BTC and have been using that stack every since that I put through Monero to clean the trail so to speak.\n\nHowever, I would like to start accumulating BTC by dollar cost averaging weekly and doing so without a paper-trail. Localbitcoins requires KYC. Exchanges from bank accounts require KYC. ATMs don't but they charge a crazy premium (20% here).\n\nWhat options do I have? I know LocalMonero is an option but I have never tried it. Anything else like that? I wish I could automate the DCA process, but I dont think that's possible without dealing with KYC/AML. Please tell me if I have any other options, thanks.",

            "Text": "whats your opinion on its ability to only do 7 transactions a second?  Just using the digital gold narrative, lets say it becomes a popular investment id imagine there would be a lot of ppl that would want their coins confirmed on the blockchain versus buying on exchange and leaving there.  Also i assume FDA has to have all its coins on the blockchain, and if Bakkt ever happens they would as well.  However, theres so much speculation that happens mainly on exchanges which is off chain.  \n\nI guess my point is last bull run, transactions got really slow and expensive, which would still work if its just digital gold, but at prices of 100k per coin there could be a lot more on chain transactions and i wonder if it could take days to confirm?   (btw for this example Lightning network is separate but its potentially what something like Bakkt will be using, i believe they are gonna kind of be like their own lightning).",

No auditing of the blockchain means no ability to verify a transfer occurred - thus lots of scamming.  Might be easier to buy BTC, then exchange for a privacy coin if that's what you're after.  If you're looking for a DEX, bisq, localbitcoins, hodlhodl, and paxful are the major options I'm aware of (no personal experience with any of them).  Also, be aware, you'll probably need to initiate offers most of the time as these exchanges don't have market makers.",

Private key would be something like E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389_SAMPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_DO_NOT_IMPORT_F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262\n\nIn 2013 i would think you would be using something like an Electrum wallet. Again stored only locally on the PC, unless you actively backed it up somewhere (cloud storage/usb drive, paper wallet).  \n\nHappy to put my sleuth hat on and see if i can turn anything up, but i would not expect much\n\n\n:edit:  upon further review it looks like you very likely never held the private keys for 50btc.  they approximated hash power and gave you an IOU for that amount of bitcoin. You likely had an opportunity to withdraw/payout but that is not possible anymore.  So if you never withdrew, they are gone, and never really existed anyway.   Only way to get what is owed to you would be to find the operators of the site and shake the coins out of them. ",

If you don't, and if it is linked to your email, you should be able to request the wallet id here: https://login.blockchain.com/#/help\n\nbut you will need to remember/guess your password, otherwise without the 12 word seed you won't be able to access it. \n\nedit: I should clarify, if you find a string of numbers and letters which dose not have any dashes, this could be your private key so do not enter it into blockchain.com. if you find such a string, download electrum and try sweeping it into there.
