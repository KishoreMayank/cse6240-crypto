            "Text": ">if people simply don't feel like it's a space worth investing in\n\nDid I say that? 'Your lol of the day' really? Clearly your a kid, but that's irrelevant. I was a smart kid, so maybe you are too :).\n\nAnyway, sentiment of the general public is highly influenced by negative information, intentionally manufactured to attract ad clicks and views, and in some cases they are paid articles to promote FUD. This is a known fact. Anyone that has lived through previous technology disruptions such as the PC/OS, space travel, cellular communications, post military internet evolution, etc, is well aware that most of the solutions that bring any of these technologies mainstream are simply not invented yet. So without vision, many people don't open their minds to accept things like Bitcoin or AI advancement, etc. They see only their present state and evaluate their future success without considering the innovation that will eventually bring them mainstream.\n\nNow back to your comment - Until people are more open to adoption, we have to wait for time to do its job. Before you know it, you'll be swiping your smart phone to scan your Bitcoin wallet and pay for gas. So no, I was not simply refering to people not thinking it was worth investing in.",
