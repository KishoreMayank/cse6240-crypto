THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS MARKET.\n\nBecause of thIs inherently short-termist approach, any news, or even rumour of news, sends everyone into a spin, reacting violently and whipping the market around, which in turn leads to more reactive behaviour.\n\nCan you not understand that this is a self-propagating problem?! Short-termism breeds reactive behaviour breeds violent swings, and so on.\n\nIt's been said before, but STOP THINKING IN A TIME FRAME MEASURED IN HOURS AND DAYS. For goodness sake just settle down!\n\nIf you believe in the projects you are invested in, just hold the damn coins and ease off the obsessive 'where is the price going?!', 'what's the price prediction?!', 'when is the price going back up?!' questions.\n\nPlease take this to heart: if you behave reactively and with a short-termist outlook: YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM, YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE MARKET VOLATILITY AND YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR OWN LOSSES.",

            "Text": "Hello r/Bitcoin! Some of you may remember that three months ago I made a survey looking at the demographics and opinions of crypto redditors and comparing the results across different subreddits. Now, three months later r/Bitcoin has over 350,000 new members and the cryptocurrency market cap is triple what it was when I made the survey! I have decided that I will make a new survey with many of the same questions to see how the community has changed! (Obviously I have had to remove the \"do you think bitconnect is a ponzi scheme?\" question) \n\n**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeiPznhM5A6eD4Erum_l3yXa4rnkfZpElQXtHkc2S4U1J5PA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**\n\nUnfortunately I was unable to post the results post for the original survey here because the post was continually getting removed automatically and I decided to leave it since I felt like I had shared it on enough of the other subreddits for most people to see it. For those of you who haven't seen the results to my previous survey, you can see that [here.] (https://redd.it/7gid7w)\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\n**Edit:** Live results of the new survey here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1clxCHXoF7z4LpNPlh7V2nu-Z3F1n-ZnwFYOVhiAIYyQ/edit?usp=sharing",

Is it simply that they themselves own and believe in BTC? Or are they rewarded in some other way?\n\n2) I understand it's completely open source, so anyone can build on the network. Once something is built, does it have to be 'approved' by the majority (95%) of the mining network to actually be implemented? If not, how does this whole process work?\n\n3) if they aren't being rewarded through methods other than simply owning some BTC themselves, wouldn't there be massive incentive for the sharpest developers to shift towards centralised alternatives where owners have very deep pockets? Hopefully the answer to 1) answers this already, but didn't want to clog up the thread by posting twice.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I thought that Bitcoin having \"bad scalability\" means that the transaction fees aren't able to change appropriately with the amount of bitcoin being sent. However, I've noticed that that's not true. Perhaps I'm not that well informed, but for example when I was sending around 1 BTC, the fee was about $800, and when I was sending 0.05 BTC the fee went down to around $500. Isn't it supposed to be the same if it's not scalable? Thanks.",

I feel like it's probably overrated now, but that's mostly just because it's currently valued at an absurd rate. I'm not high on today's altcoins that claim to have special utility, but I wouldn't be surprised if some novel use for it comes up some time in the future.\n\nThis is all still pretty new technology. If Bitcoin were TCP/IP and the genesis block was the equivalent of when IBM adopted that standard, we'd only be in 1993 right now.",

Personally, I do think some are undervalued but there are so many that seems promising. I think it\u2019s a great strategy for businesses to do this too. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re issuing stock to gain capital for start up. It\u2019s hard for me to say they\u2019re overvalued when I look at the long term possibilities, these coins can really disrupt the markets we have today. I agree that it\u2019s hard to keep track of all the coins out there, but the majority are created to serve a purpose, so it makes sense that a company wants to tailor a cryptocurrency to their specific use case for the biggest effect. Now that we\u2019re starting to come out with universal wallets it won\u2019t matter as much about keeping track of them. It might just become the norm to have and use multiple cryptos regularly. Imagine having 10-20 bank accounts in the same app, each dedicated to a certain activity like travel, food, entertainment, savings, etc. Could be a great way to budget and organize your finances. ",

            "Text": "The increased number of Segwit transactions in these blocks mean that more transactions can fit into the block, which increases the actual size (in bytes) of the block to greater than 1MB levels.\n\nBefore Segwit, blocks had a size limit in bytes of 1MB. Every transaction is a variable size in bytes depending on how many [inputs and outputs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Explanation) there are. After Segwit was implemented, the limit is not defined in bytes but in *weight units* (WU) or *vbytes* ([more info](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units)). For non-Segwit transactions the weight is simply the transaction size in bytes multiplied by 4, but for transactions sent from a Segwit wallet this is less than 4 times the transaction size (so a smaller weight than legacy transactions). Check out [this page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units#Weight_for_segwit_transactions) for a more detailed explanation of Segwit weighting.\n\nEssentially, this means that the weight limit of 4WU (often written as 4MB but actually only equal to 1MB of legacy transactions) allows blocks to hold more transactions in them if some transactions are Segwit transactions. The more Segwit transactions are in the block the more free space there is for non-Segwit transactions, allowing the blocksize to effectively increase above 1MB when more Segwit transactions are included in a block.",

So in the end, unless a miner is willing to lose some money to increase segwit addoption by prioritizing their transactions, there is not much possibility for them to do bigger blocks until more of the \"interesting\" (fee-wise) transactions are waiting.",

Market sentiment is very volatile ATM.\n\n2) USDT is issued by Bitfinex, a technically insolvent exchange that accounts for more than half the total world trade volume according to Worldcoinindex. Failure of Bitfinex is a much bigger risk IMO.\n\nHaving said that, I am holding and intending to buy more if a big enough dip overcomes my conservative mood ATM.",

If you can't make a blockchain, you can't be an expert on the topic.\n\n2: People who say 'Bitcoin is a bubble, will fail, is dumb... but blockchain is revolutionary'. That's the quickest way you can tell me that you don't understand Bitcoin or blockchain.

They're bringing a semi-centralized, touring complete side chain to BTC. They're doing what eth should have done - tapping into the liquidity of BTC. Large retailers probably would prefer (due to gov coercion) a more controlled side chain. If it pans out, RSK will probably implement LN and be able to transfer btc via ln through their federated pegs. So we'd get crypto-anarchy while pretending to be legit for regulators.\n\nOpen Bazaar is a cool idea and looks like is has decent developers. If they ICO we'll have to lynch them though.\n\nNamecoin was a good idea but they didn't have much talent and it wasn't the right time for them.\n\nThat's about it. Everything else is either a scam or a manifestation of the over regulated industries in Western nations. It's easy to regulate producers of physical stuff to extinction because they require physical locations that are easily discoverable. So there is an imbalance in markets where a disproportionate amount of wealth and human capitol goes to increasingly abstract industries. In the big picture most programming languages, software, and websites are entirely redundant.",

This lectionary was derived from various Protestant lectionaries in current use, which in turn were based on the 1969 Ordo Lectionum Missae, a three-year lectionary produced by the Roman Catholic Church following the reforms of the Second Vatican Council.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Conceivably Bitcoin could accomplish the same goal, but as of now Monero is the OG privacy coin and they have a great team. \n\nEthereum, I admittedly don't fully understand. But I see it as the OG smart contract coin. Again Bitcoin could bring this functionality under it's wing (and I know at least one project already is), but right now it's unique in that respect. \n\nThe alt coins are more or less just fun to play with. Some of them are interesting projects. I personally think bitcoin can do most everything they set out to do with updates/sidechains, but in the short to medium term they'll rise with the crypto market cap. And I've got very mild FOMO should one of them moon big, I like to have a lil of each.",

People keep saying Ethereum runs more transactions than bitcoin, so it scales better. I am pointing out this is not true. Also one of my problems with Ethereum is that it has so many deeply technical projects going on right now that I am pretty sure no one can understand them all, whereas bitcoin seems simple in comparison. This is why I will not invest in Ethereum, as I believe very few people investing in it right now actually understand it. ",

            "Text": "They state on their website that \"Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USD\u20ae is always equivalent to 1 USD.\"  Whether that's a true statement or not could be debated.  My point is everyone keeps stating they \"make up money\", which is a direct contradiction to what they've stated and there has been zero evidence presented that it's true.  At least have the intellectual honesty to state it is your own conspiracy theory, rather than just state things like they are facts when there is no back-up.  The truth is Tether is no different than any other alt coin or bitcoin for that matter.  Even if they DIDN'T back up each tether with traditional currency, it still has the value it has because others have bought into it.  Those that use it don't expect to go and trade it in for USD.  They would convert to BTC and then to USD like any other alt coin.  These people understand the way it works, and are ok with it's value being tethered to the dollar.  It's no more or less risky on an inherent level than any other alt coin, as in \"I'm paying you actual dollars in exchange for 1's & 0's in a computer screen\".  Now, if you do have proof or someone else does that something fishy is going on, I would like to hear about it.",
