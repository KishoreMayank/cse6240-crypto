            "Text": "> Is the high energy cost of bitcoins Proof-of-Work actually required for its level of security? \n\nthe higher the hashrate, the less likely someone can 51% it.\n\nso, yes. \n\nWill BTC still work if not using all that energy? sure. Will someone be able to doublespend and roll back the chain if they have more than the network hashrate? yes.\n\nI prefer security of the chain over energy reduction. All the miners should be using renewables any way. Wind/Solar/Hydro and there is no issue with energy consumption.",
