Then you need to realize that minus a few exceptions, most of these whales you refer to represent multiple investors and traders, not individuals. \n\nNext, understand that this hapoens all the time - think about all the bitcoin that were acquired at ground level years ago and were sold at 15-20k. Or the marijuana stocks that were bought for a tiny fraction lf what they were sold at by huge players. Yet, the world still spins as per usual. Go figure right?\n\nLastly, do you really think that the groups that hold between 10,000 and 20,000 BTC would wait for a 100k price to sell? Why would they hold that long when the profits would be so tempting long before that price?? Which is why 20k didn't hold long in 2017, and why stocks all move in a wave pattern on their way up. In any case, there's nothing to worry about regarding your concern. Millionaires and billionaires are made all the time, and on even more outlandish terms than holding a large amount of BTC.",

This will be a whole new species of rich people who got rich because they were idealists and visionaries, not because they were born with the name \"Rockefeller\" and own shares in the Federal Reserve.\n\nSpeaking of war, do you know why wars happen?  Do you know who makes money off war?  When fiat money defeats itself and Bitcoin takes over, war will make rich people poorer, not richer.  It will dis-incentivize war in a big way.",

You can make it inactive, but not force it to settle. Channels regularly are inactive and they are routed around.\n\nIf for some reason you chose to force close as many actively used channels from as many nodes as possible at once (which we have seen a handful of times already as people experiment with the network) transactions would be routed around alternative routes where available. Force closed channels also have a clearing time, some of my channels don't clear for over 100 hours worth of blocks. Gracefully closed channels resolve almost immediately.",

The only question is whether a bunch of sell orders appear as people decide to take an profit (or maybe recover from an investment from say Oct 2017), call that the \"Luxury Quilted\" scenario, or alternatively, sell orders are pulled and getting a decent price becomes really hard. I think of that as the \"Izal Medicated\" scenario.",

You must realize that when bitcoin hit 20k it then dropped like a stone. That's because although investors would prefer to sell small amounts at a time and continue to ride it up, they are worried that not all others will do same. Thus, that perspective is shared across the board and mass selling occurs to catch what is perceived as the safest profit taking point. Sometimes they buy back in at a lower price, but who knows. This works over time because it creates greater distribution. The entire process takes generations, and large amounts of wealth and power in the hands of a small percentage of people has been the status quo throughout history.",

            "Text": "I am in communications since prior to the Internet.  And a student of Marshall Mcluhan. He died before the Internet was here.  He made this testable hypothesis: A truly new media has been created if and only if prior media are communicated within it.  He didn't get to see the Internet and moreso mobile Internet swallow every prior media.  \n\nMoney is a communication medium.  Gold has high fidelity but is lumpy and heavy.  Bank money is information but is saturated with loss (aka inflation) and distortion (aka bank fraud).  \n\nUp until Bitcoin, bank money has not really been captured by the Internet.  It uses it as transport but not as a native application.  \n\nSo I will dispute that Bitcoin will take decades to overtake money.   I think Bitcoin's market cap will exceed the Fed's balance sheet before 2030. \n\n\n",

            "Text": "Sound argument. And I agree that money is most definitely a communication medium. Bitcoin will accomplish the goal of aligning money with today's digital society because it is in a sense becoming money as streaming content. It will change everything. That being said, I too am in communications..well network security and operations, digital advertising, and more. I grew up without internet and I am aware of the time it takes for infrastructure to be implemented. I remember when swiping a credit card with a huge contraption was inconvenient at best. It created a carbon copy.. and took time. Infrastructure and end user tech for bitcoin, online apps, ecommerce etc will take a long time to integrate with society, especially since much of it is not created yet. But I am pro bitcoin and believe it is the future. First, I see it succeeding as a value store, and yes its price in USD can easily go 20X -50X by 2030.",
