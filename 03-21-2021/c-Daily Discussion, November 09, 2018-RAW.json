Last year I joined in on the BTC ( A few months before moon circa $5000 ) What I loved and what was so exciting was when the price was going up, shit I scrambled trying to get hold of more miners. I sold at ATH and bought those dips. and sold again and made loses, but overall I made a tidy profit and was happy. I remember when I took a break from it all and noticed BTC at $12K I was like awesome buy the dip!! My point is even as it crashed I was still finding it entertaining. At the moment it's just so boring? Maybe that's why people selling up and throwing the towel in cos it's just not fun anymore? I know what you all going to reply, but c'mon surely we all loved the hikes and spikes. Also I still mine and have been HODLing for like what feels like years ( Only a few months) ",

As she get's older, more people are going to notice she's attractive and start showing more interest in her, but for now, she's not on their radar. For those watching her grow up, we already know she's going to be a heart breaker, and thankfully there are tons of bright minds making sure she'll have the brains to match.",

            "Text": "Yeah, it makes no sense. The correlation seems irrational and shows immaturity (or manipulation) in the price of Bitcoin. On 11/5 there was a perfect opposite movement (which would be expected for a mature store of value), but then on 11/7 and today, they moved drastically in the same direction.\n\nBitcoin should be a safe harbor for store of value, but people still bolt to cash / weird things happen whenever there's a slight twitch in the stock market.\n\nLove to hear from someone who can explain this beyond price manipulation and fear.",

Paper gold, silver, wheat, sugar, etc. trades order of magnitudes more volume than the underlying physical matter. Nobody ever asks to be delivered, and hence the paper markets are free to set the price. When bitcoin had its big rush a year ago the finance sharks opened BTC future exchanges, and that was the end of it. BTC is now tightly regulated, not in the meaning of government rules, but in the engineering meaning of say steam pressure being regulated by the Watt valve. The net effect is what you are seeing now: BTC stuck in a narrow range (6-6.5 k$), and alignment with general markets. You never really thought a new yorker billionnaire was going to drain the swamp that bred him, did you?",
