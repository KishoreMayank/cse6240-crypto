            "Text": " \n\n# The Coming Bifurcation of Bitcoin\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/the-coming-bifurcation-of-bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/the-coming-bifurcation-of-bitcoin)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n*Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to blockchain projects and a former EY blockchain lead.*\n\n*The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk\u2019s*\u00a0[*2018 Year in Review*](https://www.coindesk.com/category/2018-review)*.*\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nAmongst many others, the bitcoin community for the past few years has been working with two particularly important ideas related to the asset\u2019s future.\n\nOne is the narrative of institutional adoption: the idea that institutions will begin buying (or facilitating the buying) of [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/) as an investment. The other is decentralization: emphasizing control of one\u2019s own monetary sovereignty and the ease with which people can participate in the network at an affordable cost.\n\nWhile both are important in their own ways, considering how institutions operate, it is likely that these two narratives are going to conflict. This does not need to be a problem, however. What we\u2019re likely to see is a bifurcation in bitcoin usage throughout the world for different purposes, and consequently, how it is handled.\n\n## The Institutionalization of Bitcoin\n\nThis thesis comes from a number of different directions.\n\nThere is what I\u2019ll call the \u201chard money\u201d thesis: that bitcoin will be recognized as a superior form of money due to its monetary policy and will be adopted en masse by institutional investors. In this case, these investors are the likes of pension funds, endowment funds, insurers and, possibly, central banks.\n\nPart of institutional adoption, however, is looking beyond the underlying benefits of the asset, and into whether there\u2019s an appetite for people to buy, sell, hold and trade bitcoin. Where there is an appetite for a financial asset, institutions will facilitate. In this case, the investors will also include individuals.\n\nThe challenge faced by institutions in working with bitcoin in either instance, though, is that financial instruments for institutions need to be boring. Institutions rarely custody their own assets. Over many years, custody functions have been centralized with specialized institutions in the financial sector, who will hold the assets and perform all management functions that are needed on behalf of the ultimate asset owners.\n\nBut for bitcoin, custody is challenging, and not just for the technical reason that private keys need to be secure.\n\nHow do institutions manage forks? Do they need a central clearing function to offset risk? How do they manage sanctions risks for transaction fees if a block is mined by a miner in a sanctioned country?\n\nFor institutions to hold the keys is rarely operationally sensible: few financial institutions have the expertise in-house nor have the appetite to take on such a technically complex process.\n\nConsequently, for institutions to get on board with bitcoin, these issues will need to be addressed, and they will likely be addressed in the same way that the management of financial instruments usually are\u00a0\u2013 with standards\u00a0and centralized products. These standards may define what forks to accept and processes to follow to manage sanctions risks, which the industry will want to ensure is in line with peers to manage perceptions to clients and regulators.\n\nCentralized products managed by specialized companies may include custodians and clearing houses: we\u2019re starting to see this already.\n\nWhile there is opposition to this centralization, and in particular how certain custodians manage forks, the reality is that few financial institutions, at least in the short term, have a desire to undertake this side of digital asset management. Many seasoned bitcoiners object to this centralization. And rightly so, at a technical level.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point in censorship resistant money if you standardize and centralize it such that it can be censored?\n\n## Censorship-Resistant Money\n\nAs recently covered in [Time](http://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/), bitcoin is effective for freedom because it allows people to store money away from a government they don\u2019t trust. If there is a demand to keep money away from the government and bitcoin is effective in doing that, then naturally countries to which this is applicable will wish to restrict its usage.\n\nWe have already seen such controls with Zimbabwe and China. For such usage, bitcoin must be decentralized.\n\nCentralized custodians, clearing houses, and standards organizations can be influenced by such jurisdictions through law enforcement and consequently will not be held up to be censorship resistant.\n\nNow, if bitcoin for some reason is not effective as a tool for freedom, it is unlikely to adopted as such, in which case this whole discussion is moot. As much as I can probably assume that the reader is a fan of bitcoin and bullish for its eventual disruptive power, we should be pragmatic about the obstacles to it being adopted as a store of value.\n\nIt will need to significantly improve in its ease of use, particularly around key management. It will need a reduction in perceived volatility, and liquidity in these countries that need censorship resistant money, that by their nature likely have capital controls restricting money movement.\n\nUltimately, we will need a shift in perception to bitcoin being seen as a store of value on par with or superior to gold \u2013 which is no mean feat in itself. So while I\u2019m optimistic we can get there, we may well have a long road.\n\nIf Bitcoin is successful in achieving this status, the logical conclusion is that we would expect bitcoin to hold a dual status globally. In countries where people have greater faith in the rule of law and central banks, censorship resistance is less attractive, and thus bitcoin could be seen as an investible commodity akin to gold with the majority of assets held in centralized institutions.\n\nIn parts of the world under oppressive regimes, however, bitcoin may be closer to an illegal or at the very least highly restricted asset, where there would need to be a greater emphasis and need of self-management of wallets and keys.\n\nIt would certainly be exciting if it was use in those countries that drove the price for the rest of the world.\n\nCentralization of bitcoin products and services are not in and of themselves bad, as there will be a different demand for the asset from different markets. It is critical, however, that bitcoin at its base remains a decentralized, censorship-resistant medium of value transfer and storage: as without censorship resistance, we don\u2019t have an innovation at all.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Text": "Got this in my e-mail today.  Just a peek into what the Gemini exchange (Cameron + Tyler Winklevoss) is doing to build the future of money.\n\n\n---\n\nHello,\n\nToday, we ran a full-page ad in the New York Times outlining what we think the cryptocurrency revolution needs to succeed. We firmly believe this revolution will re-architect trade, the financial system, the Internet, and money as we know it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut it won\u2019t be easy, and there is no guarantee. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe crypto revolution has the potential to solve meaningful, real-world problems that no other technology can \u2013 but only a thoughtful, rule-based approach will get us there. Revolutions that build sets of rules to ensure a better future, are the ones that last.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a result, we are sharing the following set of guiding principles that we believe will help crypto fulfill its ultimate promise. As we build a real, sustainable bridge between the \u2018old world\u2019 of money and the future of money, we strive to always:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Build the Rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo work with regulators to establish thoughtful regulation that promotes positive and fair outcomes for all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn 2014, we testified at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Virtual Currency Hearings. These hearings set the stage for a thoughtful dialogue between the NYDFS and the crypto community, eventually leading to the New York Virtual Currency Regulations. To date, NYDFS has licensed or chartered 12 virtual currency businesses. All of these businesses, including Gemini which is a New York trust company, operate within a regulatory framework that fosters consumer protection. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition, we have championed best practices that we believe make Gemini a safe place that fosters market integrity:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Marketplace Conduct Rules - On September 21, 2017, we adopted Marketplace Conduct Rules. These rules were modeled off of the Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) Rulebook.\n- Marketplace Surveillance - On April 25, 2018, we announced our partnership with Nasdaq to implement Nasdaq\u2019s SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to monitor the Gemini marketplace. As of August 10, 2018, SMARTS has been deployed on the Gemini marketplace.\n- Market Surveillance Team - On April 25, 2018, we hired a Head of Market Surveillance. Since then, we have built a Market Surveillance Team that continues to grow. \n- Virtual Commodities Association - On March 13, 2018, we published a proposal for the Virtual Commodity Association, an industry-sponsored self-regulatory organization for virtual commodity exchanges. CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz issued a public statement in support. The initial working group held its inaugural meeting in September 2018.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is just the beginning as we plan to continue to engage and work with regulators across the country on both the state and federal level (Gemini currently has licenses or approvals in 49 states), as well as internationally, to help shape thoughtful regulation and oversight so that consumers are afforded the same protections in the crypto market as they are in more traditional markets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Play by the Rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo operate with necessary governmental or regulatory approvals. Ask for permission, not for forgiveness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough we started building Gemini in 2014, we waited until we received our New York trust company license in October of 2015 to begin operating. Our decision\u200a \u2014\u200a to ask for permission, not forgiveness \u200a\u2014\u200a was a first in cryptocurrency. We chose this path because we believed that in order to build the future of money, we had to first build trust in this new asset class.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are compliance-centric company \u2014 we have developed (and will continue to invest in) cutting edge tools for our Compliance Department to ensure that Gemini is not a place for bad actors. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. Value Security Over Profit.\n\nTo never cut corners. To set the standard and follow best practices in order to provide a platform that is free of hacking and fraud.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinancial crime affects both fiat and cryptocurrencies alike, but the crypto revolution will not succeed if our industry is plagued by nefarious activity. High-profile hacks that result in catastrophic losses must become a thing of the past, and we must shake the image of an industry characterized by poor security standards, internal controls, and policies and procedures. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn an effort to do so, we built our team with a security-first mentality from day one \u2014 a team that has built a state-of-the-art hot wallet and cold storage system and is deeply committed to employing cybersecurity best practices to protect your funds and the integrity of our platform. Recently, we added a further layer of protection by securing insurance coverage for the cryptocurrency that we hold on your behalf in our online hot wallet. We are, and will continue to be, committed to making Gemini a safe and secure platform to store your cryptocurrency. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n4. Be Principled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo do the right thing \u2013 because it\u2019s the right thing \u2013 even when it\u2019s the hard thing. To put the interests of our customers ahead of our own and provide proper disclosures and transparency.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe four pillars of Gemini are Product, Security, Licensing, and Compliance. We refuse to compromise in any of these areas and will continue to invest in long-term solutions that align with our North Star of building a company that provides enduring value to our customers \u2014 for more than a 100 years \u2014 a Centurion. We will continue to do these things even when it\u2019s the harder, less profitable, and slower path in the short-term. We\u2019re in this for the long game; we\u2019re trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n5. Pay it Forward.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo bring cryptocurrency to the people and places that need it most.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLike the invention of money itself, which solved the coincidence of wants dilemma and removed the shackles of barter; like the evolution of credit and debt, which helped transfer capital from idle savers to risk-taking entrepreneurs; like the invention of the joint-stock company, which spurred on investment by enabling atomistic ownership structures and limiting an investor's liability to his or her stock ownership; and like the invention of the stock exchange, which allowed liquid markets for a company\u2019s shares to emerge, the invention of cryptocurrencies have irrevocably expanded our concept of money and will forever change how we exchange, transfer, and store it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNot since the dawn of the Internet has technology had the potential for such profound impact. But in order to make such an impact, we must bring this technology to all reaches of the globe. We have started by building the Gemini dollar, which brings U.S. dollars onto the blockchain and to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. This is the first of many projects we hope to embark on that help foster, among other things, financial inclusion (e.g., banking the 1 billion+ unbanked citizens of the world), reduced friction and costs of cross-border payments (e.g., remittances), access to digital safe-haven assets (e.g., buying bitcoin through the Gemini Mobile App), and a more decentralized Internet that returns control of your data back to you. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJoin the Gemini Mission\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are only at the beginning of this journey. Yes, some of the hardest work remains ahead, but we\u2019re up for the challenge and we know you are too. We welcome industry leaders, developers, builders, entrepreneurs, investors, and whoever else, to join us as we strive to build rules for this amazing revolution that will ensure not just the future of money, but a better future for all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron + Tyler\n\n---\n",

Bond to US rate has moved to around 3/4:1 from 1:1 and since the fundamentals here won't change it's only a matter of time until the bond is useless. They printed more notes causing inflation so unless you have USD you pay more. People are buying stuff like bricks and cement (not available anymore) to store their value. With Bitcoin I know at least by this time next year I should have around the same amount of money vs waking up one day to redollarisation and being told my bank balance is $0",
