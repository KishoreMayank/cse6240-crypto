Would they just deny the account?\n\nBecause after searching and reading a lot of threads in the forum, I don't think I feel comfortable giving out my SSN even with the whole KYC/AML stuff that companies have to follow. I don't mind IDing and bank info but yeah, SSN is too far. And the alternatives that people mention aren't great so I think I might just not do bitcoin after all which is too bad. ",

No one will be able to keep track of every purchase they make with crypto's and calculate the change in asset value.  Believe me, I'm not an advocate of government intervention, but they are coming, whether we like it or not.  ",

            "Text": "Looking at December 17th at 9:00am, the price of Bitcoin was $19,810.33. On December 22nd at 11:00am the price was $12,510.16. The price difference between those 2 dates is $7300.17\n\nThis is a textbook definition of a volatile investment and can be considered a considerable drop. Much of this drop happened in just over a day from the 21st at 3:00am to the 22nd at 11:00am, dropping $4513.71, which can be considered a catastrophic drop by Investment terms. \n\nInvesting in Bitcoin and investing in Stocks are 2 separate strategies and are volatile in their own ways. As I had originally based that comment off of Stock investing, I respectfully say that I will not be eating my sock due to the reasons stated in the above paragraphs. \n\nAnd yes I know I changed it to a month, a week may be a long time  in Bitcoin exchange due to the volatility, but on the stock markets, it is a longer time due to slower climbing rates, so that is my reasoning for the change. \n\n",

There are many ugly trade-offs in tech/crypto. You can't have fast AND censorship AND cheap payments on a decentralised AND secure AND easy-to-scale network... There has to be an \"OR\" somewhere in there.   \nSo tl;dr: there are no \"more technically capable\" kids on the block. Any competitor claiming to be has an ugly trade-off hidden somewhere.",

Unfortunately it's not recommended we use these on the mainnet yet as they are still ironing out some of the bugs with lightning and all the companies and individuals involved are prioritizing security b/c it involves people's money (no rushed development). \n\nYou can check out the lightning thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7npeh6/lightning_network_megathread/\n\nKeep an eye on the thread as the development is actually happening pretty quickly.\n",

            "Text": "I might have a little insight on this. Firstly, to clarify something: decentralization has nothing to do with privacy. If thats what you are after, then Bitcoin isnt the right coin for you. While it is true that addresses themselves are annonymous, the way that law enforcement works is by targeting the entrance and exit ways to crypto, which are exchanges. Once it has bin confirmed that certain funds have bin used in illegal activities, these can be tracked. Since wallets are annonymous, your friend has no way to clear his name if somehow those coins found their way to him. If you want to obscure your tracks, you can use a mixing pool, where it is no longer certain which money came from which address. Now this part I dont have certain information, however all coins associated with this mixing pool will be attributed a certain value in relation to the bitcoins laundered in this way. Eventually you will have certain addresses at exchanges where this \"crime\" value reaches a certain point, which is a strong indicator you have found your drug dealer or what have you. The beauty of the blockchain is that its a public distributed ledger. All you need is enough transactions and eventually you will find your criminals.\n\nYour friend probably just got in contact with tainted coins. Nothing to be done about that probably without a lot of legal work. Good luck to him either way. Once Lightning comes out and is widely used, such tactics will once again become much harder to implement due to offchain transactions not being recorded. ",

Which would be about 6 dollars per day for you. Regardless of how much bitcoin actually rises. Their own calculator actually puts it at $2.51 dollars per day, which would be a measly 0.14% return. This would equal 0.91% return in a week where bitcoin went up 17%.\n\nNext time, maybe do a research where you put your money first. You clearly have no clue what you bought, it's all cleartext on the site.",

            "Text": "Just take a look at the /r/bitcoin front page with critical Electrum vulnerability, even though Bitcoin is simple compared to other altcoins, there can still be some vulnerabilities in Bitcoin implementations (not Bitcoin itself, but its implementation by 3rd parties). Bitcoin is being developed to be the most secure and stable base, you can say protocol that other ideas can build on top of it without affecting its security, so in the future, adding new features to Bitcoin won't affect the security of the Bitcoin. This is how you build complex system.\n\nSo for example we have RootStock is being built as a sidechain to Bitcoin, finding a security flaw in RootStock won't affect Bitcoin, this means that the development on the second layer will be fast than any other altcoin. \n\nNow lets take the example of Ethereum that wants to have everything run as a first layer, this is just calling for problems in the future, adding a new feature like switching from PoW to PoS in Casper may always introduce new vulnerabilities in the future that didn't exist in the past versions, this means that the development of Ethereum will never finish, thus you will always not be sure how secure it is. Whereas in Bitcoin, it is being developed with the same security standards as a protocol, meaning that they actually have a goal that once they achieve it, they will stop changing its code, this will means that it will have years of proven record of being secure.
