            "Text": "Bitcoin outside observer here. Can someone point me to a proper, detailed writeup of the effects of Bitcoin becoming \"too expensive to mine\"? (If the price becomes quite low).\n\nTo be clear, I understand that there is some connection between the difficulty of mining, and the amount of mining power available. So I believe that as the price drops, inefficient miners turn off their machine, thus making the job more profitable for those that remain, which helps to balance it.\n\nBut I don't think that mining is strictly based on \"proportion of work done\", right? Isn't there some raw amount of mining that has to be done? In fact, I saw headlines about the scheduled \"drops in difficulty\" that happen every once and a while (indicating that mining difficulty isn't just about work relative to other miners). Presumably, there is some amount of mining that has to be done for the network to work properly, right? \n\nIf say the price dropped way down to $1000, what would happen to the miners? Would suddenly almost all mining become unprofitable, or would there be some sort of equilibrium?\n\nI'm just an observer who has followed bitcoin with no real stake either way, but this is one technical issue I've never had explained to me. I know that when fewer people mine, it becomes more profitable to others, but I don't think that all mining difficulty is relative, and I assume there has to eb some point where it's basically unprofitable for *any* mining to occur? Or is that not the case. (I understand we're not close to that, I'm just using it as an example to understand the mining economy).",

            "Text": "The longterm progression of Bitcoin is one that can be explained with lots of idle time. Not sure if \u201cidle time\u201d is a good thing or not...or whether it defines lackluster volume during the bull run offseason. Since the beginning of Bitcoin in 2011, it rapidly rose to $1000 in less than 2 years before falling hardly and losing nearly 90% of its all time value when it fell from $1500 to $175 in 2015. Then came the 2 years of idle time marked by slow steady growth into the next bull run of $20,000 before falling and losing nearly the same value nearly 90% today at $3700. How I explain this idle time is that its occupied by people who use Bitcoin for its true intention which is as a medium of exchange like money. That\u2019s why even if there is never another bull run, there is a good percentage of traders who will continue to use Bitcoin as an exchange leading to its value rising. The bull run is activated by everyone else who seek to capitalize off it as an asset. When the whales identify this scenario, they further pump BTC and the bull run is officially activated. News media create more hype and FOMO is spread like wildfire. This is how the crypto market cap went from $20 billion to $830 billion in less than 11 months and it\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s fallen down to $120 bill today. FUD and FOMO are inherent in Bitcoin until institutional money and government intervention occurs to stop the manipulative practices in Bitcoin. Today in this idle time, Bitcoin is utilized by three types of people: HODLers, whales and people who use it for its true intention which is regular currency exchange. I\u2019m glad for idle time because it marks another progression of Bitcoin into the next value tier ($100K, $200K, etc).",

            "Text": "Everybody dig deep and remember that Bitcoin arose from the ashes of the financial crisis.  When you put it in cold storage such as a ledger, then you will realize that this is the first time you are in control of your money (outside of cash in your pocket or mattress).  The fact that you can be in control of your money is under appreciated.  When you put money in a bank, THEY are in control of it and they make money off your money.  In the future this could flip.  So now all the fucked up shit that Banks do to make money, you can do yourself and basically strip them of their power to do fucked up shit you disagree with. You buy bitcoin to take power away from them, and by doing so you are forcing change.  \n",

That's kind of the whole point of how money works. If you valued everything in silver pieces or shells, then the next generation of currency would obviously have to begin in its infancy by being valued in silver pieces or shells.\n\nSo ironic is the last thing I would call that. Common sense and obvious is the first thing I would call that. Also added to this equation is the fact that Bitcoin is destined to be accepted worldwide, to accommodate a connected, digital world with one globally accepted currency. It will need to rely on FIAT all around the world for generations as it continues on its current growth path.",

If that is true, great, lowering difficulty will keep mining profitable for the people still doing it, but isn't there some baseline level of computation needed to verify everything?  Saying \"it'll get fixed by lowering difficulty\" makes me think it's right back to \"waste this much energy for a reward\".

Who is doing the manipulating? To what ends?\n\nThere are hundreds of exchanges around the globe, people buy, people sell. That's not manipulation, it's a market.\n\nWhat the US government and established institutions don't like about Bitcoin is that they cannot control it. Period.\n\nThere have been literally five parabolic runs followed by bear markets-  [2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and now 2018](https://i.imgur.com/KwXyHMZ.jpg).\n\nPeople who bought these troughs and sold the tops have done better than investors in any other asset class in the history of the human race.\n\nBTC has gained 4 million percent since it hit exchanges nine years ago.\n\n",

Now if you are seeing people make snarky comments like that then maybe it is a sign of the bottom. \n\nIt is actually intuitive when you think of it. When there is too much optimism, the price probably already reflects the max the market can support. On the other hand, when everyone seems very negative, the price probably already has been bashed down to the minimum level.",

            "Text": "It's only less expensive right now. Eventually there needs to be some kind of scam insurance against buyers and sellers. This scam insurance costs money, and therefore there needs to be a 3% fee. The bank processing fee isn't only for fraud. In fact, I bet that fraud is only a tiny fraction of where that money goes. It goes to administrative costs, advertising, marketing, and some kind of protection incase of broken items, lost items, or other issues. With American Express, they can actually take the money back from a vendor if the vendor does something considered shady. With bitcoin, they can't. All of that costs money, and hence the 3%. Everyone is merely focusing on what they want to see, and not the big picture. It's like, when 3D Printing suddenly became popular, every internet kid in a garage said \"I can build and sell 3D printers for less than others\" and they rushed out to make websites. Suddenly they realized that they had to charge what everyone else charges because purchasers lie, vendors give broken parts sometimes, there is insurance you need, advertising costs, rent, etc.   I feel Bitcoin is a lot like that in that people say 'it will be less than 3%' and that may be true, but not by much. And if you get it to 2.5%, that might be millions for the WalMarts but for the mom n pop, that's not enough for them to really make the switch.",

Does bitcoin cost the same as fiat for purchases? (no, I have to pay a fee to buy bitcoin and then go buy the exact same thing).\n\n3. If my bitcoin is hacked, is it insured by the bank? No. \n\nAnd yet all of Reddit says I am stupid because I am saving money by using fiat and Bitcoin can't compete - YET. One day, maybe, but not anytime soon. Remember, it's 10 years old, and the price is only $3700 and it's adoption as a currency is minimal at best. Not even 1% of the worldwide vendors adopt it. ",

It's a speculative market, and the game is simple. Drop it down till even the strongest hands drop their bags, and then grab it cheap, pump it up and rinse and repeat. Each bull being higher than the previous and this can go on for years. Once you learn the hard way, you tend to hold the bag a little tighter, because nobody knows where it tops or bottoms.",

There's no way to predict which input will yield a certain output. Say the difficulty is level is based around how many zeroes that the output needs to start with. At current difficulty, the network will only accept an answer that starts with 10 zeroes. Your input can be quickly checked but it takes a lot of guessing to find an input that works. You're rewarded for finding a valid input and the input is what the network needs to verify a transaction. The difficulty adjustment would be, instead of 10 zeroes in a row, that now we'll accept 9 zeroes. It takes less guesses to do that - and less work.",

These behaviors happen continually with BTC. I don't think there is anyone who has day traded crypto for more than five minutes that hasn't seen this. \n\nThese manipulations are used to drive the price up and down in order to make money. These behaviors aren't illegal everywhere, but the United States still cares about these behaviors when evaluating if they will approve an ETF because they are patently against US law. I'm not talking about some macro whale conspiracy or China trying to drive down prices or some USDT conspiracy (who knows if these are happening?), I'm flagging day to day trading behavior.",

Let's take this example a little deeper. Imagine that carrying around cigarettes all the time can be dangerous (you could lose them or someone could take them from you) and cumbersome (you're wealthy in prison, and have accumulated 50,000 cigarettes).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine someone then comes up with a way for little bits of paper that are tough to replicate, with a social contract where they can be exchanged for cigarettes. In other words, passing the paper to someone else would generally work as verifying that some transaction has taken place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, you can obviously see how this scenario would never work, because why would \"verification of some data\" be beneficial? Except... you've just described the idea of currency. If you're going to argue against the idea of currency in general, you have a pretty uphill battle, as the past few thousand years of civilization have shown that it can come in handy.",

So if the currency of the USA suddenly had a massive global falling, which will happen one day, the top minds in the banking and financial sectors will join forces to come up with a new plan to fix the problem. Nobody will say 'let's use bitcoin'. If anything, they will create their own coin. Could you imagine if the US Government suddenly decided to abandon all banks? Countries around the globe would go into mass chaos and rebellion. You and I know that it will not happen like that. At no point will banking regulators and the US Government decided to convert their cash into an electronic form of currency that is global.",

There are clear policy arguments for both regulated and unregulated commodity and financial product markets. All I know is that the SEC is a regulator, and they believe that there is utility in regulated markets. When determining to approve or not approve an ETF, I bet ya that they will land more in the \"CFTC rules are not useless garbage, and we should protect U.S. retirement funds against manipulation\" camp rather than the \"regulation is tyranny\" camp. So, it is probably more likely that they will not approve an ETF due to the current Bitcoin market freedom/lawlessness dynamic.",

Every time bitcoin rises and falls people think that was the time the world caught on. Yet, there's always many times more people ready to jump on board for the next cycle. \n\nThe reality is that even with last year's hype, only a very tiny percentage of people have ever actually bought bitcoin. There are still many who don't know what bitcoin is, just that they heard of it. Still, this entity continues to grow, and continues to be developed and improved. Last year, the wait time for being approved on an exchange was enough that many were turned away. The process of dealing with account approvals, wallet addresses and storage devices was way over the average person's head. Now exchanges have ramped up their infrastructure, there are apps that allow you to buy and store bitcoin with a few clicks, and mainstream platforms like bakkt and proposed ETFs are entering the scene. The next phase will have a much lower barrier for entry. \n\nSo in short, yeah - I am definitely one of the guys who believe there are cycles and we are just in the very early stages.",

It's a long game but if you play with money you don't need or mind losing it's loads of fun! Nobody forces anyone to participate and that's the main factor here.. too many people in this sub are posting as if it bothers them that other people they don't even know are willing to risk their money. If it goes a few years and stops gaining me money then perhaps I'll remove the crypto market from my portfolio, but so far it's been bull, bear, bull, bear and up up up for years. You do you and I'll do me and we're all happy:)",

The people in Vegas don't have even bigger morons with holier than thou attitudes critizing their choice to have a little fun with money they can afford to risk.\nI've never put more money in crypto than I was willing to lose, and unlike my other investments I get a rush from it, and enjoy it.\nNow if you don't, and it's not for you, then I'm fairly certain none of us really care.\nSo yeah, crypto market, vegas, penny stocks, horse racing, poker, and whatever the hell else a person wants to enjoy should not be grounds to call them a moron. In fact that sounds like the words of a miserable human being who is reflecting some crappy life of their own. I work quite hard and invested quite strategically over the years to have disposable income to enjoy the crypto market, travel the world, try new things and not stress over the money. So while you struggle to get your pompous head out of your ass, I'll gladly take my profits from the next bullrun and see a great show in Vegas.",

And let me tell you, the negativity and bad reputation caused by Mt. Gox dwarfs the negativity of today. If Bitcoin survived ...and thrived after that, I believe it can survive whatever gets thrown at it. Well, aside from a catastrophic technical failure of course.\n\nThe main point is to always consider Bitcoin as currency, is a tiny infant just starting to grow, because a currency takes many generations to implement into society. But as a tech, it's been developing for 10 years, and if something has been around and growing for 10 years, it's WAY past the 'fad' stage. It's here to stay.

            "Text": "Look, a currency is not created by Agreeing. People will not keep their word.\n\nSo something of Real Value must be injected. For example if I trade with Rolex watches, and I say: \"Kiss XYZ and I'll pay you 2 rolexes,\" then if the person says: \"LOL I don't accept your currency. I know I had agreed, but I'm breaking my word!\"\n\nThen the other guy will say: \"Fine well screw you, I still find value in these 2 rolexes.\"",

            "Text": "Your perspective is extremely restricted. I'm not insulting you, you may be quite intelligent, but your allowing yourself to be limited by traditional thinking. If we all did that, we'd have zero innovation. \n\nIt's never been just agreeing, it's about valuing. And it sure as hell is not about keeping their word lol. If people know that they can buy a Rolex watch for a certain amount of bitcoin, then the person selling that watch would know that he can get an equal amount of value for that bitcoin.\n\nIf it's not uncomfortable to think about outside your usual box, then it's not going to ever give you the tiniest glimpse of the future. Things we're doing today were completely unthinkable 100 years ago. You need to get your timeline straight - this kind of thing isn't going to happen next week. It takes generations. ",
