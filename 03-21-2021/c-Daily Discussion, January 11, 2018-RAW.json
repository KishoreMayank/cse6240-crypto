My wife's car broke down the other day so yesterday I sold a little BTC on GDAX and sent it to my bank around 10am. Expecting not to get the money for a week. My bank account received the money around 4pm yesterday. So when anyone says BTC is not liquid, I have proof that it is more Liquid than my normal Savings account which takes 3-5 days to transfer. While I don't like some Coinbase/GDAX things, this was a nice surprise.\n\nSidenote: I have other saving not in crypto that we could have used to fix the car. I don't have money I can't afford to lose in Cyrpto. ",

I found one called \"Gatecoin\" but the volumes are too low so you would take a big loss if you were selling BTC/ETH. \n\nCoinbase isn't supported in Hong Kong.  Bitstamp is currently not accepting any applications.  So I wonder what is the best alternative now?\n\nThanks in advance",

            "Text": "I think today, and possibly tomorrow, are gigantic in terms of where BTC goes. If we drop below 12,600 we are going well under 10k in the near future. If we clear 15k, it is going up to 20k+. You can kind of see it in the chart too. Big movement is coming in one direction or the other. I don't think the whales will have a high incentive to stop either move (they would happily buy at 8k, or unload at 20k).\n\nEDIT* I also see a weird 15k sell wall that seems designed not to be bought through on GDAX, and something similar that reappears on Bittrex (symmetrical staggered steps). It reeks of manipulation. Not sure if it is to drive down to 8k, or for accumulation, but someone is going to send us in one way or another. ",

            "Text": "BTC is not yet mature. The architecture needs an L2 for small-value retail payments. Those worked in the past because the network was lightly loaded (very few actual users) and folks were willing to wait 10-60 minutes for confirmation. Bitcoin is the only protocol that is on a path to global-scale ubiquity and complete substitution for fiat alternatives. Etherium is hamstrung by its own engineering complexity and Bcash doesn't actually address any underlying issues - it just kicks the scalability problem a bit further down the road and ensures that when that blockchain is fully loaded, a lot more people are going to be unhappy with higher fees and long confirmation times. The hype has gotten out ahead of the engineering, but Bitcoin Cores is taking the right approach: slow and steady, solving the hard engineering problems in the right way. Things will look different toward the end of this year, I think. We should let the media hype pass by and be happy that the pundits and speculators have moved their attention elsewhere for the time being. There is work to be done and all this noise isn't helpful.",

If you want to buy $10k of BTC, try to buy in small increments every few days for a month or two, and plan to hold for 1-2 years. Unless, that is, you plan to sit 24/7 in front of your terminal and day trade. That can work, but it's only slightly less risky than playing high-stakes poker at the pro table.",

The problem is that there is still very little liquidity at exchanges, which means that you only need maybe 10 to 20 million dollars to impact the price a big deal. I have noticed several times, especially at Gdax, that a quick sell off leads to a chain reaction. A few very big whales/institutional investors dump a couple of millions worth of Bitcoin which leads to a lot of stop loss limit orders to be activated, which drops the price even more. After some time there is a quick rebound in which these whales buy their bitcoins back at lower prices. You would be amazed to see how little money, relatively speaking, you need to fill a large part of the order book at Gdax for example. It doesn't really help to see so many new investors panic selling all the time. ",

Especially when considering that a) most new traders lose money, and b) short term capital gains tax will wreck  any profits you may have. \n\nBest recommendation is to buy often what you can afford to lose, and consider long term vs short term taxes. \n\nAlso, get a hardware wallet (Trezor, Nano S) and move your coins off the exchange once it is a substantial amount.",

Is it okay if I copy you word for word in a FAQ?\nI'm still working up the FAQ, and I think your question should be the first question.\n\nThe Rainbow Charts are generated using the Compound Daily Periodic Rate (CDPR).  The CDPR is similar the a Daily Periodic Rate (DPR), except it considers compounding when it's derived. CDPR looks at the price change over time and creates an interest calculation that predicts today's price from the starting price for the given period. The two Rainbow Charts I've been leaving posted by default are calculated based on the 2012 CDP and the 2017 CDPR. The table below the rainb chart shows more CDPRs based on different time periods. It also shows doubling rates and projects when the price might reach a given price based on the CDPR for the period that's set in the given column.\n\nPlease ask clarifying questions. I want to give you a good answer that's clear and easy to understand.",

Adoption also will not tell you why the price jumped to 19k, but it explains why the price has now 4-5 digits instead of 3. So, in conclusion, you did not really ask a proper question, because on a larger scale of things, the price did not really go down, it just corrected a bit and is still in the area where it roughly belongs.",

I surely did not think \u201eyeah, 19k, that\u2018s because of adoption!\u201c - that was pure speculation and overheating. December was bananas, let\u2018s be honest, but of course I was happy because I made some money, or rather the value of my bitcoin investment went up. Still, that does of course not automatically make the upwards price movement more rational than the downwards one. That\u2018s all noise. But when you zoom out to a 3 year scale and look at monthly candles or weekly or whatever, there\u2018s less noise and more signal. ",
