I know how to do everything using my cellphone and my wallet and I've become pretty savvy at it. I've been asked by a nonprofit to give a workshop on crypto currency for sex workers, and I want to make it accessible, so I want to teach them how to use a paper bitcoin wallet because some of the attendees might not have cell phones.\n\nI know how to make a wallet on blockchain.info, how to make a paper wallet at a bitcoin atm, and how to scan the private key and sweep the paper wallet, but I'm hung up on the idea of importing a wallet, specifically I've read that if you import a wallet and spend part of the bitcoin, the entire wallet is depleted. Where does that bitcoin go? Will it still be available for the user with the blockchain.info wallet, or will it be gone forever?\n\nSo far I'm planning to just tell attendees to just sweep their paper wallets and destroy them, but I heard that importing can have a benefit by allowing money to be sent to the public key, then having it immediately available on the wallet. This might be helpful for girls who maybe only get 20 minutes of computer time at a library or drop in centre, so they can get in, post their ad on a website, then leave. It also means that they don't have to type or scan the private key every time, which exposes them to potential keylogging attacks. It can also be difficult to type it in every time if you're disabled or addicted to substances.\n\nIf anyone can help me out here in plain English it would be much appreciated. ",

This time it should move from 20k to $4k - a little more because there is more awareness today. \n\nPrice drops over the weekend because traders stop trading (they have jobs too) - and most cash out their gains. Price might drop to 7.5k this weekend. During the week, the price will stay between 8-9k next week. Then a drop to 7K next weekend. This will continue till we stabilize at a low (possibly 4-5k)\n\nYes, it can bounce back - but the possibility is low. ",

            "Text": "Thought I'd share my interpretation of the current daily candlestick chart. So far the last two candles have been star doji's, this represents indecision between the bulls and the bears. We're currently forming a third doji, and in sequence this is known as a Tri-Star. The Tri-star pattern should be confirmed if the price action remains stagnant and the current candle closes near the opening price.  \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tri-star.asp  \nA Tri-Star generally speaking indicates a sharp reversal of the current trend. I thought It would be worth mentioning as a potential possibility. Cheers!",

I personally have a low target price at which I'm willing to pick up more as well. Others feel that bottoming out at $5k now instead of later would position us for the next bull run sooner.  \n\nI'm not a fan of bear markets, but it is what it is. The market doesn't care for whatever emotional attachments we have to our coins. It just does what it does and transfers wealth from one set of hands to another and rewards those who understand fundamentals and TA better. If you believe in the tech and believe we will go parabolic this year, Bitcoin crashing back to $5k shouldn't stress you out. This is truly one of those cases were hodl'ing tests your patience.",

Though after the drop, perhaps back to 9k, I think the market stability will be in far better shape. Sure, traders benefit from the market volatility so that's not going away, I just expect to see a bit more confidence in the market at that point, which should reduce the risks of dropping back to 8k anytime soon.",

Will that change over time, I believe it will, however not now. Nintendo stock amassed over 9 billion dollars in net worth because people thought that they created PokemonGo. To me, alot of the public is too heavily persuaded easily by the news (hence my pokemonGo reference), and with bad news regarding crypto lately i dont see any huge runs in the near future due to lack of public investment. Crypto is still just for 'techy' people like us and young guns wishing to become millionaires overnight and we continually see people losing their money which reflects poorly on the crypto community and in my opinion is holding it back. Not to mention that uncle sam is inevitably going to take his cut from all of this eventually and that will nearly destroy the market. ",

I am pessimistic, and I do think it will go down to absurd price levels. It's a market and it will try to squeeze coins out of hodlers. A lot of hodlers will break if it goes deep enough, and the market knows that. What the fuck is going on here? If you are holding for 50k or 100k, then why does it matter if it's 8000 or 8500 today? Just put your coins in a wallet where you can't panic sell them, and take a look at the price every 3 month. Really. \n",
