If this is true then history will remember that the bear market started a month ago.  If you have been hodling you have already hodled during a 50% crash. Even if it goes down 80% from the high and we are in a year long bear market, you have already held through half of it, why not keep hodling until you are in the green.

Is the leadership transparent and above-board (i.e. providing communication, progress reports, etc.)?\n8. Would I be okay if I were to lose my investment despite the best efforts of such-said crypto company/foundation?\n9. Is such-said crypto company/foundation abiding by or working with the regulatory community to ensure a smooth transition (by far one of the most important question)? \n10. Diversify your holdings (forgot about this one).",

No Sox fan ever, well up until the repeat World Series win in 2007, would say anything positive ever really until the game was over. The Sox would be up by 8 and there'd be people all over saying things like, \"I hope they don't blow this lead. There's still two innings left.\" \n\nI love your FUD, it makes me think of the Sox in my teenage years. Are you wrong or right? Time will tell. I don't know what'll happen. I own Bitcoin and it's become an obsession of sorts, so for me, the ride is fun. Watching the price of Bitcoin in real-time, especially when it's really moving is akin to sitting at the blackjack tables. \n\nOne thing is for certain. If you own some Bitcoin, no matter how much, you'll be able to tell your kids and grandkids how you helped to usher in the collapse of the global financial banking industry and changed the world. That's pretty fucking cool. \n\nSee you on the moon.",

No doubt the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. However, with that being said, there are superior blockchain technologies out there that can do this far better than Bitcoin. Due to scalability issues, expensive fees (more than any bank I've ever been affiliated with), and a lack of consensus among miners yielding fork after fork, Bitcoin has created a veil of instability and unpredictability around it, making industries/corporations/retailers, at-large, wary to utilize/accept it as a payment option. The only use-case that I can see is a store of value, but even that begs the question, based upon what? Speculation? Greed? FOMO? What is BTC being valued against to give credence to its existence and value?",

            "Text": "Their security seems decent. They require 2FA by default. They've never experienced a major (public) hack. Their UI is very simple, providing a good experience for first timers. Supposedly they offer cold storage vaults for people who are not comfortable with securing their own wealth. They are *mostly* professional and trustworthy when it comes to actual money.\n\nPrivacy is very bad given their history of scrutinizing/penalizing customers over transactions which don't even involve them. They pass very high fees onto their customers (miner fees, premiums, and convenience fees). Buys are often very slow, taking 4-7 days. Their site goes offline regularly during peak periods. If you require customer support, you will be waiting for at least a month for the initial response. Their leadership has taken a highly politicized (perhaps even adversarial) approach toward Bitcoin, promoting several contentious hard forks which failed. Their operations appear to sit on their hands when it comes to deploying network upgrades such as Segwit. They are responsible for a large amount of block chain bloat due to inefficiencies in their infrastructure, such as basic transaction batching and extremely poor fee estimation. Their leadership blames Bitcoin itself for their own bad practices. ",

Blocks are green because price doesn't drop and are technically upward movement because they are buying out the current market which (eventually) eats the wall.\n\nIf someone needs to sell they can either sell at the wall price and wait their turn gambling that buys continue to come in at that price, or they can jump to the front by undercutting the current market price and sacrificing a very small amount of profit to instantly sell (because there are already buy orders waiting unless you are selling a large amount of btc.) \n\nAll in all not very suspicious when volume is this low. Short-term Bears (long bulls) are not buying because they think the price will go lower ergo their market share isn't participating in driving the price up. Bulls don't have enough momentum/funds ready to enter the market either because they are timing the market for a lower price or there just isn't enough interest to overcome the bears. The bears creating the sell wall aren't panicing enough to drive the price down (gambling that the price will bounce again and they can maximize their profit/stoploss I.e. short-term bulls)",

            "Text": "I wouldn't necessarily call it a shit coin. Like I've said before the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin that gave rise to all other alts is worthy of a Nobel. It's just outdated for it's intended purpose/use-case as an alternative to fiat. Even with Bitcoin's new Lightning Network it still cannot deliver the speed and scalability of other coins.  There is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't \"move\" until the channel closes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "Text": "lol, we're about to end january and it's already the year of alternate coins?\n\nBitcoin is still in diapers, but it has proven to be stronger and more stable and secure to attacks than other coins. The problem with altcoins is that they don't have near the amount of users than bitcoin has, so they haven't experienced the problems of bitcoin. Other promising coins are still in beta or in closed development. Also not many altcoins have been used to purchase stuff, so they haven't been put to the test properly.\n\nThe LN and other developments to come will only strengthen the position of bitcoin as a currency, and the fact of btc being decentralized will play an interesting role in the world economy, now that other countries have more motives to stop using the dollar away as the de-facto currency for international trade. If they succeed, everyone will be in for a surprise if the dollar price falls. (and a war along with it, maybe).\n\nWhat I expect for this year is that people starts accepting Bitcoin as a currency to do business, and keep it circulating in the network instead of trading it for fiat. That will drive the price up like crazy.",

Provided they actually had the money, that\u2019s not a problem, but it has been looking for a while now like they were just using it as a front. They\u2019ve refused on multiple occasions to show proof of their funds, so now it\u2019s led to a subpoena.\n\nEssentially the implication is that the price of crypto is even more inflated than we thought because it was being tied to dollars that either don\u2019t actually exist or no longer exist. \n\nThat\u2019s a simplified version, at least. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as knowledgeable as the others here to provide you with the full rundown. ",

Not sure where you are getting 190sat/byte but it is crossly inflated (coinbase?)\n\nNow, past few hours the mempool has been filled with pretty expensive tx up towards 100-140sat/byte, so the 2-5sat/byte might not be valid now as of today. It is impossible to say if it will go down again right now. \n\nBut my guess is that 5-10sat/byte will clear within a few days, but that is a guess assuming the number of transactions doesn't increase.\n\nEdit: 8sat/byte and 9sat/byte just got confirms, so 10sat/byte should be good for the moment.",

They said shit like how can the Internet handle so many large emails when the total bandwidth is 5 Mb/s.  \n\nOr maybe an even more famous example is Moore's Law and how many claimed computers would stop getting faster because there are only so many transistors you could put on a chip.  Then people started designing computer architecture in smarter ways and computers got even faster.\n\nUltimately if a technology is powerful enough, seductive enough to capture the imaginations of the uber geeks, a lot that seem unsurmountable to the small-minded can be overcome.\n\nWill this happen with Bitcoin?  Maybe not.  But it's going to take more than simple naysaying to stop those who already see this as the greatest disruptive technology since the Internet.",

            "Text": "I do both. When I got in I only used money I could afford to use (10k for numbers sake) but I would rather waste 5k on a fancy new car I dont need over a risky investment so I told my self when my 10k turns to 8k I'll pull out my 5 and consider the other 5k a loss.  The 5k i pulled out either waits to go back in if i feel like the price will go up or I spend it when i want something. \n\nIf my 10k turned to 20k I told myself I would pull out my principal and do the same thing.",

Every time there's a big move like this, you can pick out several news or other items that I'm sure impacted things to a certain extent. I also think it's a big red herring to focus on one or two, because like you said, it doesn't do lot of good and there's no real way to quantify the impact weighting. 100,000 people selling could have 50,000 individual reasons and only the aggregate in hindsight looks like some big black swab type thing.
