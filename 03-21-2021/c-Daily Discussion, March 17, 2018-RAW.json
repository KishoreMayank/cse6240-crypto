Major investors would agree about this, specifically the investors in lightning. I am super excited to have a lightning wallet app on my phone, a true digital \"bank\" account. This is seriously one of the most exciting things to enter the bitcoin space in a long time. Though a lot of people are naysayers about lightning, saying the tech is too hard to understand. Here's the thing though, people don't need to know how the tech works. Do you think the average person even understands how the internet works? Nope, and as long as you build an user interface around a strong system that has a utility then people will use it. So with that said I cannot wait to send my friends money for beers through the lightning network and see where this all takes us!",

Cryptocurrency can be compared to religion. religion for centuries was used to control population and enslave them. Cryptocurrency is used by few hundred people who own half of btc that manipulate the market in a way where regular people have a delusional hope that one day they will get rich so you put money into crypto using loans, credit cards, mortgaging houses. Banks overseen it and now they try to ban it. Dont excluse the odds of that whales know each other are high and together they can easily nullify  the market to take all your money leaving you broke. Once the market becomes worthless the cycle repeats. people please get out now the market CAN crash to 3k or below and it is inevitable because it is not decided by the world, its decided by few people.  I was a victim of bitcoin scam too. i invested 10k into trx  when it was 24 cents and 2k into ela at 90$ and icx 35k satoshi and now I am broke. I just have 1500$ left from 12k and I will aknowledge my losses and get into real regulated market. there are much better markets out there where you are fully protected. my wife invested into shopify last year her stocks went from 35$ to 190$ and it will only grow. no market manipulation whatsoever. stop feeding the whales please. blockchain is the future, I agree. however i believe when institutions step in, it will be regulated but they will use  their own network rather than the corrupted btc and this is why btc can one day just disappear.",

            "Text": "Side note. The Mt. Gox selling effected prices. How much is debatable. However regardless of where it was sold OTC or not,  it would have effected prices negatively to some degree. \n\nMy FIRM belief is that all the banks worldwide that issue credit cards pressured Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, etc. to issue huge cash advance fees when buying crypto. \n\nWhen that didn\u2019t slow anything down they decided to ban crypto purchases all together with their Credit Cards. One by one, bank by bank, country by country. Don\u2019t expect any banking collusion charges as that\u2019s a fruitless tree with all the $\u2019s in politicians pockets worldwide.\n\nDo any exchanges even allow CC purchases anymore? Answer is Yes. However so few bank-backed credit cards allow it now that the majority of crypto purchase transactions are denied. The Exchanges big challenge right now is to get a denied newbie purchaser with credit card to instead link their \u201csafe and secure\u201d banking info to this new investment platform that they likely have little knowledge of. \n\nExchanges still try to execute CC purchases since a few still allow it, but it\u2019s not likely to go through. This will effect exchanges worldwide over course of next year or so when they must overlap prior year sales and fees collected. Likely expanded their services and company due to huge growth but now their incremental fee they all loved so much in 2017 has disappeared. Exchanges biggest challenge this very second is replacing ridiculous credit card fee income from last year into \u201ctrust\u201d. Trust that a person can purchase without giving a complete business stranger their Social Security #, their banking info, etc.\n\nAs mentioned before \u201cthey\u201d(Banking and CC Industry)realized short term they were reaping HUGE rewards, but long-term subsidizing their own demise. \n\nWhat business would want to accept Credit Cards at 2.9% if crypto is less than 1%?  Most people don\u2019t even realize credit card fees are retail businesses\u2019\u2019 #1 expense BY FAR! Not even close. More than payroll, utilities, and miscellaneous business expenses COMBINED for a small retail establishment. Very few purchases in cash.\n\nIt\u2019s built into their COGS but regardless if they can sell their goods and get instant payment, and pay 80% less on fees on their largest monthly business expense....well, that\u2019s a no brainer. \n\nUntil exchanges make it easier to buy crypto like it was with credit cards late last year, crypto will struggle. NO ONE wants to have an exchange(with no backing of govt) linked to their personal checking or savings. And until this dilemma is fixed, crypto will float at current prices or drop much more due to diminished \u201cexecutable demand\u201d(demand may be there but too many hoops to jump through by new investors or too much risk tying your personal banking info to exchanges by new investors). Many will just invest in stock market backed securities through their stock fortfolio at Fidelity, Schwaab, Ameritrade, etc. WHICH IS WHAT THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY WANTS!!! ",

Banks rule the world.\n\nBanks are going to do everything they can to crash Bitcoin, so they can control the narrative that crypto is bad. Barclays and several other banks were found guilty of rigging the LIBOR rate, or exchange rate, for profits. IN the case of Crypto, they can't. \n\nBanks are inherently dishonest (like politicians) however they all work within the same set of rules, and because of that, actually trust each other's dishonesty.\n\nSo, they want this to fail so they can create their own crypto or own blockchain. Imagine if Chase said 'backed by blockchain technology' vs 'backed by Bitcoin'. \n\nSo right now, any competition to banks will be met with swift regulation, fear, justice, and dominating the narrative. They will have their top people create the crash on purpose, and I expect it to sink far below 6k.",

GF\u2019s out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I\u2019LL TELL YOU WHY. It\u2019s because I\u2019m a bad trader and I KNOW I\u2019M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT\u2019S GOING DOWN I\u2019M GONNA SELL he he he and then they\u2019re like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY\u2019RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I\u2019m not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I\u2019m already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU\u2019RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying \u201cOHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\u201d YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.\nso i\u2019ve had some whiskey\nactually on the bottle it\u2019s spelled whisky\nw/e\nsue me\n(but only if it\u2019s payable in BTC)",

We have a bear market on our hands, it seems, but trying to guess when (or at what price) it will turn around is a fool's errand. \"Why\" it will turn around (i.e. what's fueling my perspective here) is the same logic that has been at play since the Genesis Block: Bitcoin is a quantum upgrade to money itself.\n\nWhen the next bull market (and the bubble it will inevitably result in) does materialize, it's entirely possible that it will be the one to finally [\"cross the chasm\"](https://goo.gl/images/Hn4sjQ), which would be... well, *exciting* to say the least. [Hyperbitcoinization](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/) is a more realistic possibility than most people seem to realize or admit.\n\nBut perhaps we're still a few years out from this sort of thing. It's tempting to be overoptimistic once you understand the stakes that Bitcoin is playing for (and how beautifully things have been shaping up so far), so it's wise to keep your expectations in check along the way. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and don't expect to get rich quick overnight or anything like that. Stay smart, keep the \"worst case scenario\" in mind, and remember that patience is wisdom.",

You can sell now and hopefully buy back in lower, but at the end of the day, it's all just gambling.  We may not see another all time high for several years, or maybe we will see it again this year.  It's anyone's guess.  I panic sold mine last month at $8100, hoping to buy back in at $5k, but that didn't work out too well.  If I had just waited until the next day, I'd have a lot more USD to put back into Bitcoin one it reaches what I think will be the next bottom.  You do what you are comfortable with, and take what I say with a grain of salt, coming from someone who managed to go from 75 BTC to 24 to almost zero when Mt.Gox took them all in 2014.",

However, where you f$&ked up is by giving in. You don't lose until you sell out. This market WILL rebound - driving this to zero doesn't make any sense for those deplorable people you mentioned. Bringing it down to make it extremely inviting to new potential investors, however, does make sense. Whoever is driving this will eventually drive it up. Right now they are focused on driving out weak hands, and you and people like you are EXACTLY the kind of person they are going after right now. Maybe you got in at BTC=$2000. If so, then I can't really grind on you to hard, but my gut feeling is that you took a loss. If so, you failed the test. I don't cling to the whole HODL thing, but in times like this you ABSOLUTELY HODL. If you don't you're just bowing down to the people you just ranted about. They can't take your money if you don't give to them...and you just did. Can't pat that on the back.",

            "Text": "I think it's more complicated than that. Miners invest in hardware and often have long term ROI over spans of 6-12 months, sometimes more. From rational self interest alone they are not likely to sell far below a price level they consider to be plausible.\n\nIf the market is willing to buy bitcoin at 10k, which it was recently, every $1k drop below this level is a major potential loss of revenue for miners and thus reduces their incentive to sell. As a result of hardware investments and projected ROI, miners provide some degree of stability to the price of bitcoin. If the price of bitcoin rebounds, which it generally does, the miners that can afford to wait one or a few weeks with selling have incentive to wait for better prices.\n\nWhile miners will certainly sell when they consider it profitable, adding newly mined coins to the market, they will be less inclined to sell at a price that they consider to be greatly undervalued. This is why the price of bitcoin is not purely speculative; it's influenced by hardware investments and the projected ROI of a large number of miners.",

There are some very smart, very weighty, very experienced, very leveraged players right now - they are the movers. \n\nPart of my personal investing thesis involves watching the technology and getting out if anything 'breaks' or is proven obsolete. That hasn't happened yet, this price action is all surface level manipulation by large players that doesn't truly concern me. My sights are on the horizon. ",

So, if it's digital gold then it's a marketplace unlike any that's existed before, and I can see that happening. However, if enough people get scared-off/burned by this and get it in their heads that *bitcoin is an awful thing*, they won't want to participate, there will be no room to grow. On that note, it's a good thing that a *bunch* of people still aren't familiar with it.",

            "Text": "This has to do with psychology of market behaviour. Let's say you bought BTC at 8000 thinking it will go up, but instead the trend changed direction and the price went down. Now you want to sell, but you also don't want to be at loss, so you're thinking as soon as it goes back to 8k I'm selling. Most of the traders who bought at 8k think the same - this is how resistance is created, i.e. a certain price where a lot of people want to sell.   \n   \nOn the other hand you might have sold BTC at 8k thinking this is as high as it's going to go, but it continues up. Now you're thinking, oh shit we're mooning I need to buy more, but then you don't want to buy for more you've already sold for, so you're thinking when it goes back to 8k I'm buying more. This is how support price is created.   \n   \nThis is also where moving averages come into the picture. For example you want to buy Bitcoin but you don't want to overpay. So you may look at 200 days MA, which will tell you what is the average price people paid for 1 BTC in the last 200 days. And that is where you would place your order. Similarly if you want to sell, the MA will tell you how much on average people got for 1 BTC during the last x days and place your sell order accordingly.",

I like it volatile because it means things change quickly. \n\nWhat I did this morning (Japan Standard Time as I'm in Tokyo) I set a buy Stop Order for $7700. Around 6am JST it triggered. It's a little dangerous because I was sleeping, but that is how it goes sometimes. When I woke up at 6:45am JST I saw it was already over $8K and going up fast. I then set a sell Stop Order for $8K because the price was at $8300 something at that time. It went up to $8400 so I then moved by sell Stop Order to $8100. As it goes up every $100 I move up the order accordingly. Keeping a $300 gap between the current price and the price you want to sell at works well. It allows the price to move up and down some without cashing you out before a decent dip. Usually a decent dip is what is going to set off your order and it will usually go well beyond where you sold out meaning you are prime to buy again.\n\nWhen buying again you should do the same thing, but in reverse. Put the buy Stop Order $300 above the current price. That way the price can move and keep going down if that's what it is going to do. I usually wait an hour or so after a dip because people are frantic trying to scoop up the dip, so you have no idea where the price might end up at. Better to let the sand settle for an hour or so. It often dips further after a dead cat bounce. That's it!",

            "Text": ">However thinking about it technically doesn't lead me to believe there's as much potential for growth as everyone thinks.\n\nI mean no offense by this, but my impression here is that when you say \"thinking about it technically\" you aren't actually really doing so. Honestly, how familiar are you with the technical specifics of consensus networks? Do you understand Byzantine Fault Tolerance and the various ways it can be achieved? Are you familiar with the merits of Raft over Paxos? Do you know how zero-knowledge proofs work, and what sort of implications these might have in different contexts (with regards to cryptocurrency as well as other fields)? Do you understand the CAP theorem, and the relevant trade-offs that it implies? Do you understand the FLP impossibility result (and can you summarize it off the top of your head)? How much time have you spent on developer-oriented mailing lists, and how hands-on have you been in terms of open-source development?\n\nOdds are, if any of those questions even slightly intimidate you (or if you have to Google the terms in them in order to even understand what's being asked), you're the victim of a knowledge deficit which precludes you from being able to \"think about it technically\" when it comes to the nitty-gritty of Bitcoin and how it works, at least on any meaningful level. Suffice it to say, for most people to whom these questions are straightforward and easy-to-answer, they/we see a *lot* of potential in Bitcoin, on a technical level.\n\nI don't say this to be mean. Unfortunately, when it comes to cryptocurrency, everyone tends to assume they're an expert; if you hadn't spent years working on cars and learning how engines work (and how to fix various problems that come up in automobile maintenance), would you go around arguing against mechanics who had spent their lives learning their trade? Of course not (unless you were an ass)... yet that's pretty much the norm in the blockchain space these days. [This meme pretty much sums it up.](http://78.media.tumblr.com/d5c7e82648b44acfe73da07ac4ef81e0/tumblr_inline_ofm7uhS03a1r20kc4_400.png)\n\n>The transactions aren't incredibly fast, and banks have no use for it. \n\nFalse and false. Transactions in Bitcoin reach \"irreversible status\" in a matter of minutes to hours; for most \"legacy\" transactions, this takes days to months. Banks have plenty of use for sound money, just as much as other rational economic actors (e.g. greedy speculators) do. Banks will adjust to accommodate whatever form of money allows them to continue making profits, and while they don't *need* Bitcoin, if that's where the winds are pointing, that's where the (smart) banks will wind up.\n\nFinally, with regards to \"transaction speed\" (and similarly, ease-of-use or consumer convenience), the reasonable way to accommodate these things is via additional layers; pretty much every complex system or network is engineered this way. Some recommended reading on this topic is [Maxwell's post from 2011](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Talk:Scalability&oldid=14286), where he discusses Bitcoin's technical and economic strengths (and weaknesses), and the intelligent means by which we can build on top of this foundation in order to compete against (or supplement, or render obsolete) other financial networks or companies. The blockchain itself is the bottom layer of the stack, and trying to squeeze everything into that particular data-structure is a ridiculous idea that makes no real sense. There are smarter ways to grow than that, and we're just now beginning to flesh these things out.",

As soon as bitcoin drops below that threshold, no one in North America will be mining because they will not be able to make money off of it at all. The system would slow down extremely and I highly doubt that the loss of an entire continent of miners would be sustainable. \n\nBuying at 3500 wouldn\u2019t so much be catching a falling knife, but catching a falling chainsaw covered in nitroglycerin.

            "Text": "It all depends on supply and demand so we can't know for sure, but bitcoin is deflationary and the supply is locked. The key factor therefore is demand. If adoption/demand rise, then price is likely to rise. If the deflationary quality of bitcoin is greater than the inflationary level of fiat currencies, then bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will also experience a general rise in price over time, in relation to fiat. It's hard to predict the future based on historical trends, but if the past is any hint, I think $30k is a modest figure in relation to its potential, at least if we project a few years ahead. Of course, it is always advisable to set up a worst-case scenario situation as well. I don't invest more than I am willing to lose. Risk vs potential gains. Inflation in fiat brings loss over time for holders of fiat. Bitcoin is one of many asset classes that may function as a hedge against inflation. Only the future can tell.",

During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car sets the standard for the rest of the negotiations, so that prices lower than the initial price seem more reasonable even if they are still higher than what the car is really worth.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Would banks find this useful?\n\nI would argue that *any* rational economic actor, large or small (of which banks are but a subset) would find this valuable and useful, if it is able to prove itself as such.\n\n>and what it has over any other crypto currency.\n\nBitcoin is optimized to be sound (digital) money. No other major cryptocurrencies have really even tried to \"outdo\" it in terms of catering to this particular niche (of the other \"biggest\" cryptocurrencies, as measured by conventional [though I would argue misleading] metrics, the respective foci are on generalized smart contracting, leveraging the Bitcoin brand, fee-minimization, and wholehearted emphasis on privacy, each of which comes with its own set of trade-offs).\n\nBitcoin has *plenty* to boast over any given altcoin, but a lot of its benefits or advantages are very subtle and require a relatively deep understanding in order to appreciate. As a quick example, the limited expressivity of Bitcoin's Script language is a definite benefit (and very deliberate design choice), whereas it might be tempting to assume that \"more is better\" in terms of linguistic expressivity (the extreme end of the spectrum being full Turing expressivity). I certainly wouldn't be doing it any justice to try to cram its manifold merits versus each particular alt into a reddit comment, in any case.",

Some are better at predicting it than others, usually because they spend the time to think things through critically and examine all aspects and angles of a subject.\n\nSo, to answer your question: yes, I can predict the future.

There is no \u2018built-in\u2019 price to something as deflationary as bitcoin. \n\nIt could\u2019ve stayed at $0.50/coin and that would\u2019ve been normal. \n\nIt may reach $500,000 per coin in a few years and that will be just as normal. Market decides price. \n\n> only reached these heights due to interest in crypto as a whole, not necessarily Bitcoin itself.\n\nWrong. The FOMO money that flooded into bitcoin last fall didn\u2019t know what the fuck an altcoin was. You think all that money flooded into the market because the public cared about crypto as a whole? Lol the public barely knows about bitcoin let alone the 1500+ other altcoins out there. \n\nYou need to pay closer attention. \n\n",

If you see BTC as a point of service payment mechanism, than yes, it is totally crazy to be over $500.\n\nConsumer adoption of BTC is NOT what is needed.  CORPORATE adoption of BTC is what is needed.  Other alt coins make infinitely more sense for consumer adoption (e.g. walking into a coffee shop to buy some coffee, paying for jeans at a department store, buying football tickets on line, etc...).",
