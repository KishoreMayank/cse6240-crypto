On that topic, it's worth noting that the recent dump action in Bitcoin has been 1-2% of the price...compare to 10-15% dumps that we saw in peak bear market. \n\nThe weekend dumps barely even affect the price anymore and are immediately followed by a high volume of small buys scooping up the small discount. If things continue this way, it would be safe to assume we are well on our way to a bull market, hopefully with slow organic growth over the next year and beyond. ",

To underpin this threat, we first derive an extensive catalog of content that poses high risks if possessed by individuals and subsequently argue that objectionable blockchain content is able to harm honest users. In the following, we identify five categories of objectionable content:[Copyright Violations, Malware, Privacy Violations, Politically Sensitive Content, **Illegal and Condemned Content**]\n\n--\n>**Illegal and Condemned Content.** Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain contains at least eight files with sexual content.

On that basis I am accumulating BTC. But: I am not betting that it will not fall below $4000 before this. So I could just invest the $N I am prepared to risk, and HODL. If BTC falls to $0 I'm out of the game, if it goes up by a factor R then I get Rx$N (less whatever for not getting the exact top).\n\nHowever, I will bet that it will not fall below $2000. Hence, I can invest $2N for the same risk. If it falls to $2000 then I'm out of the game, but if it goes up I get Rx$2N.\n\nAlso, I'm betting that should the price fall to $2000 then that will involve a sudden massive drop. By setting a stop that is well below the day-to-day price range I avoid getting involved in day-to-day, but have a good chance of not getting caught by that sort of drop, and I can then buy back in lower without exceeding my risk (I would lose some $ amount, but less than the $N risk, and would end up with more BTC).\n\nOf course, its all more-or-less-well-informed guesswork, but it is not buy high/sell low; it is about maximising potential rewards for a certain managed risk.\n\n&#x200B;",
