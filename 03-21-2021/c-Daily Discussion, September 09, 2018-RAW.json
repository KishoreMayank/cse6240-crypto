To be precise, there had been some recovery from the bottom but not enough to convince most that another dip was not going to happen again. Price was around $350.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3rrxv6/daily_discussion_friday_november_06_2015_part_2/\n\nAnd here are the links to the Daily for the rock bottom date on 21/8/2015 (flash crash to around $170) and the next day 22/8/2015:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3ht3jj/daily_discussion_friday_august_21_2015/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3hxlwu/daily_discussion_saturday_august_22_2015/\n\nYes, the Daily discussion used to be on the bitcoinmarkets sub at the time and not on r/bitcoin.",

I know this is extremely ill advised but I decided at the time that since transaction costs were so high and it's such a small amount of btc that transferring it out to a personal wallet and then back to the exchange when it was time to sell would eat up too much of the gains (losses).\n\nAnyway, I believe transaction costs are lower these days if I'm not mistaken, I have an electrum wallet set up, how much would i expect to pay these days to transfer 0.064 btc from the exchange to my own wallet for safekeeping? Am I correct in thinking that costs have gone down? Is it worth transferring? Cheers in advance. ",

Be very careful with leverage. Good luck.\n\nI like using kraken to short as they are US based. Other exchanges such as bitfinex and bitmex allow this but I would be careful. Bitfinex has stolen funds from users before to cover their ass from stolen funds. This is highly illegal for any US based company to do and funds from US exchanges have never been stolen. \n\nYou sell for more than you have and therefore have a negative position. Only exchanges with margin allow for shorting.",

            "Text": "Those who adopted early took a risk and ultimately were part of the reason acceptability increased for a superior form of wealth like bitcoin. So it is incorrect to call early adopters as having not contributed anything. \n\nYour argument can be made against any traditional passive investor too who puts their capital at risk and earns the rewards of that capital turning out productive. Active contribution is great but it is not the only way progress is made in the world. Progress is a function of capital and labour. For example those who invested in Apple's ipo in 1980s and held till now are very rich but would you argue they contributed nothing except getting in early? If all those investors did not put in their capital then perhaps Apple would not have taken off. ",
