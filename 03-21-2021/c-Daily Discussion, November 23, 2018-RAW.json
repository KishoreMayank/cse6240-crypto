            "Text": "Times are tough, no doubt about it. But I'm genuinely not worried in the long run, which is why I am confused to see how the daily discussion is mostly anti-bitcoiners talking about their assurance of btc's death. Reminds me of late 2017, when anyone skeptical of the parabola was immediately hated, and that you were an idiot if you didn't think the coin was absolutely going to take over soon. Makes me wonder how many comments come from the same individuals. Ones that hate when it's in a bear market and praise in a bull. Essentially taking the emotional path of least resistance, which has really never gotten anyone anywhere in life. \n\nI love tracking bitcoin wallet creations. Keeps me confident in the future. Sure lots of these are duplicates, lots are people that will never buy any bitcoin or have any understanding of crypto...but some are new HODLERS, some are using their bitcoin, some hate current financial structure. It makes me giggle to hear people say bitcoin will reach 100 bucks or go to zero. Look at this chart from ANY time frame. And explain how that is remotely possible when new user rate is constantly increasing. \n\n[https://www.blockchain.com/charts/my-wallet-n-users?timespan=1year](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/my-wallet-n-users?timespan=1year)\n\n50% percent more users than the ATH. All that indicates to me is the extreme overbought and oversold conditions of this market. Especially after the recovery from 3 separate \"crashes\" that were heavier than this current one. The prevailing sentiment from bearish people has been \"Yes, but this time is different, lots of people lost money, and will never get reinvolved\". This is both irrelevant and fictitious. Human history has shown people are addicted to greed, as one Redditor subtly mentioned with his casino example. The morons selling now will buy once it recovers and is approaching or exceeding ATHs. Additionally, people seem to forget how small crypto markets still are. 74 billion?? That's really nothing. 31 million users in a 7 billion person world? IMO, the hard times for crypto are over. The previous crashes were more dangerous due to the total lack of involvement and understanding. Just like how business bubbles that survive a few massive bubbles (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) make it stronger and less likely to ultimately fail in the long run.",

The marginal benefit of the newest, greatest mining rig starts to diminish against the current best rigs.\n\nTherefore in terms of profitability in mining it's a race for the cheapest electricity.\n\nWhilst we're seeing cheap electricity in Iceland and large subsidies, in the end there's still a middleman.\n\nTo source cheap electricity, you basically have to manufacture it.\n\nWhich brings me to the point why don't power plants start mining cryptocurrency?\n\nA power plant is on a microsecond level trying to achieve equilibrium between supply and demand. Over-supply means a power surge and under supply means a failure. In effect they are very rarely running at full capacity.\n\nI would have thought that power plants should use any excess capacity and redirect it towards mining cryptocurrency.\n\nThey are in the best position to profit from it.",

            "Text": "I can't remember the first time I heard of bitcoin, but I remember last fall was the first time I took a close look at it.  I spent a lot of time that fall watching with interest, then with trepidation, and finally with outright horror at the bloodbath to come. I learned what the hell it was, how it works, what it was useful for, what it wasn't useful for, what were the barriers, where were the potential pitfalls, etc.  I read all the sidebar material, and then article after article, and white paper after white paper.  I looked at youtube videos of people considered the leading authorities in bitcoin.  And I looked at the trading.  I looked at insane rise in price and I saw story after story of people selling assets to purchase bitcoin.  \n\nAfter processing it all - I identified several red flags and concluded the insane prices were based on psychology and nothing else and that bitcoin was going to crash and crash hard.  \n\nI feel pretty well vindicated a year later.  \n\nRedflag #1: Bitcoin isn't what most of the promoters say it is.  It isn't a currency.  It isn't even particularly useful as a median of exchange.  There's almost nothing it does that  the traditional banking system doesn't do better. \n\nRedflag #2: Bitcoin isn't used for much of anything.  99% of owners simply trade it.  What little use there is in commerce is mostly illicit or symbolic.\n\nRedflag #3: Bitcoin is a threat to controls on banks and money - a lot of that regulation was for a lot of good reasons.  Those reasons don't evaporate with bitcoin.  I concluded that it is almost near certainty that regulatory crackdowns will prevent the fulfillment of the vision that is promoted.  \n\nRedflag #4:  it is not nearly as secure as the promoters indicate.  There seem to be dozens of ways people can be separated from their bitcoin.  The higher the value, the more likely that is to happen.  Moreover, storage is greatly problematic - a recorded key is hackable or can be stolen.  A memorized key can be lost forever in an unexpected accident.  Exchanges are far from secure.\n\nRedflag #5 - Tether and Bitfinex are shady AF, almost certainly have contributed to bubble. The chickens haven't come home to roost on that one yet.  \n\nRedflag #6 - Bitcoin is a paradox.  The idea of a \"deflationary\" currency isn't a good one - but even if it were, it's completely contradictory.  You don't spend deflationary currency, you hoard it. But if you hoard it, there is no utility.  If there is no utility, then there is no real value.  But if there's no value then the price craters, but if the price craters you should spend it. . .etc.  \n\nRedflag #7 - it's too volatile to be a good store of value.  Best left to speculators and hedge fund operators.\n\nRedflag #8 - no one can tell you what the true value is.   There isn't a liquidation value.  \n\nRedflag #9 - no definitive path to useful transactions. \n\nRedflag #10 - the promoters of bitcoin include a lot of people who want to see systems disrupted, governments topple, banks fail, and people have complete freedom to engage in any transaction, even illicit ones, even dangerous ones, out of inference from states.  \n\nRedflag #11 - Bitcoin is cumbersome.  Every trade is a taxable event.  This is going to complicate tax filings for many users.  For that reason alone I would not expect widespread use for average taxpayers who want to file a 1040ez. That alone will greatly limit reach. \n\nEdit I'll add a 12th red flag.\n\nRedflag #12:  While the volatility makes it useless as a store of value for most people (who need some degreed of predictability in their savings - they're usually building for something - a house purchase, their kids college tuition, retirement, etc) it is great for is highly sophisticated traders with access to extraordinarily sophisticated tools and analysts who can use superior information to make money.  That's great if you're a shark.  Minnows get destroyed.  Since I'm not a hedge fund and I don't have access to quants, high speed trading equipment, and sophisticated algorithms that can spot arbitrage opportunities, I'm at a huge disadvantage - most ordinary people trading are likewise at a huge disadvantage.  And that doesn't even touch on the ability of large capital to move relatively small markets like this. \n\nThe 10th one is along the lines of \"judging you by the company you keep\". Not everyone in bitcoin is a nihilist, but nihilism and anarcho-capitalism is definitely a lively strain in the bitcoin community.  \n\nNot much has changed in a year.  It's a little less dangerous as an investment since most of the upward price swing is gone (I still wouldn't recommend it) - but longterm utility to me seems greatly suspect.  \n\nI concluded then and maintain now that bitcoin is best characterized as a synthetic digital commodity.  Its real utility is almost entirely confined to illicit trade.  And most of the value is derived from speculation.  Unlike actual commodities (metals, pork bellies, oranges, etc.) there isn't an actual consumable product that has a market. That is an inherently unstable condition.  \n\nNot in the business of predicting which way the price will go - in fact, I predict it will continue to swing wildly.  But it won't end up doing anything the promoters say it will do.  And for those reasons, I continue to stay far away.\n\n  ",

But, Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash didn\u2019t ring a bell to him. I thought he was joking but he was serious claiming he wasn\u2019t familiar with every altcoin. I told him Bitcoin isn\u2019t a fucking altcoin...it is the coin, like the top coin that started it all. He was like...sorry haven\u2019t heard of it. And he was dead serious. I didn\u2019t know it was possible for someone to be familiar with cryptocurrency and not know Bitcoin, I just wrote him off as a noob. I don\u2019t think that will ever happen again.",

Is bitcoin in a position to be the currency of a future world-data blockchain or would that spring up from a private company approach using their own cryptocurrency?

I suppose a company would have to provide some killer service to the masses like eBay but I have no idea what that could possibly be at this beginning stage.",

On the card there's an option to stamp your private key onto the back side of the key and the public key is on the front, aren't we supposed to to hide the private key and not let anyone see it? By putting it on the back of the card that you carry around would that be considered a dumb thing to do? I was caught off guard by it simply asking if I wanted my private key on it cause I thought nobody was ever supposed to have them except me so why would anyone have one in the open? ",

Sure lots of these are duplicates, lots are people that will never buy any bitcoin or have any understanding of crypto...but some are new HODLERS, some are using their bitcoin, some hate current financial structure. It makes me giggle to hear people say bitcoin will reach 100 bucks or go to zero. Look at this chart from ANY time frame. And explain how that is remotely possible when new user rate is constantly increasing.\n\nI don't mean to piss on your parade, but these stats here paint a little different picture:\n\n[https://bitinfocharts.com/en/bitcoin/activeaddresses-btc.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/en/bitcoin/activeaddresses-btc.html)\n\nThere are only 600-650k active addresses, down \\~half a million from 12/2017 peak of 1.1 million.\n\n[https://bitinfocharts.com/en/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/en/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)\n\nThere are only \\~6.5 million BTC addresses worth >$100, and thereof only \\~2.1 million addresses worth >$1000.\n\nAdoption is a myth.\n\nEdit:\n\nComparison with this *'historic'* rich list chart from 2/2018 shows only very little change:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180206125340/https://bitinfocharts.com/en/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20180206125340/https://bitinfocharts.com/en/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)\n\nLots of consolidation in the dust addresses (down 7%) happened, but the 0.01-0.1 range and the 0.1-1.0 range (where one would expect most new adopters who throw a couple hundred bucks into bitcoin to show up) only added 4% and 2% of new addresses respectively. Both ranges combined only grew by\\~40k BTC (from 660k to 700k BTC) over the last 9 months. And that despite the fact that price is now lower than back then (on Feb 6th price reached the 6k low after the 20k peak).",

Conflating just a decade old 'technology' to financial markets or currency and trying to predict how it will work in future is never gonna work. IT IS NOT THE SAME. \n\nAlso the game really changed in 2016-17, You can't mine coins on your laptop anymore. The 'democratization' was killed when these huge mining farms came into the picture. Bitcoin isn't making people in poor countries richer or bringing ethics to currency trade. The people who could afford mining rigs were (on a global scale) rich already. This was, in most parts, always a gold rush. \n\nIf this thing has to last, people have to be honest at least. \n\n&#x200B;",

So at 20k you really exhausted maximum exposure. Yeah, and then there is the option of institutional money but of course institutions are not going to gamble with people's money so that is excluded. Conclusion: 5 to 10 years before hitting 20k again.",

Old tech and miners running with expensive electricity have to shutdown scaling down the network.\n\nIdeally we should have a stable price and a stable hashrate (all things being equal such as technological advances in mining efficiency and electricity cost)\n\nNow we are in a situation were mining operation are hurting (hashrate is going down for 2 difficulty retarget, many/most of hobby miner are getting off the grid, some major mining operation are filling for bankruptcy) , it means that Bitcoin is oversold for the current size of te network. If the price continue to tank, only the most healthy mining operation will continue to sustain the network until the price stabilize. Then we will be able to shoot back up once we reach the bottom of the pool :-)\n\nYou also have delay in scaling up because of the lead time to deliver the hardware to the miners + deployment time.\n\nYou have delay in scaling down because miners are not shutting down until they loose hope of BTC price recovery or when the debt collector start knocking at their doors.\n\nNew advances in technology could increase the hashrate for a identical price of BTC because those miner will get a better margin over their competition. This will push older tech out of the network continuously.",

Buy on the green and hold through ATH thinking their several thousand dollar investment will take them to the moon and make them millionaire. Then, bear market hits. They're in the red very early during consolidation because they bought so high when the hype train was already beginning to fly. Despite many chances to buy cheap BTC on discounts during a bear market, they're to weak and scared to buy. Yeap. Whales would never get rich without dumb money to manipulate with hype and capitulation cycles.",

Just brand it as b2 and hold a huge event for only \"crypto elites\", but not anybody with a technical background -- old folks with fat IRAs are best. Tell them that next year's market cap will be 432.8 billion, and each unit will be worth at least 5600 but they can buy today at 10 so long as they buy a minimum of 10,000 units ($100,000 total per investor).\n\nGet 200 people to sign up and collect their money. For a few months send out some technical-sounding reports telling how great b2 is doing. Then, put out a report that events in China plus a conspiracy of the banks and the Fed have really hurt b2, but you still have faith and will buy back units at 1 each.\n\nKeep putting out reports for another couple of years until the Statute of Limitations for fraud expires, and then say with deep regrets the banks and the Fed won, so you're having to close up shop, but b2 units can be redeemed at par in Zimbabwean dollars.\n\nEasy peasy!",

            "Text": "That's a cool website, and I will definitely look at it in the future. I appreciate the link cause it adds some needed insight. Overall I am surprised that the active address rate isn't even lower. Considering BTC is 80% down and the active user rate is only down 50%, I wouldn't consider this bad at all. Not necessarily encouraging for the near future, but far from discouraging. Also, the slow rise over the last 8 months is reminiscent of the 2014 recovery. (Yes I know past performance doesn't predict future performance...even if it is the best indicator for bitcoin). And like I said, even if those new wallets are 99% trash and worthless to bitcoins value and price, some are representative of new hodlers and adopters.",

Craven, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner. \n\nThe biggest mistake people make is to evaluate the potential of any technology based ONLY on its current state. You can't imagine bitcoin in use with taxes and pension funds because you picture it as it is today. You imagine a volatile asset crashing and bubbling injecting chaos into the system. Why don't you consider what it is very likely to become? The developers are not slacking off - there are more of them and you must know they are going to continue improving the bitcoin blockchain.  We are in very early days here. So before you ridicule bitcoin, consider the incredible intellect of those involved with building it. Consider how far it's already come in only 10 years, and then consider where you think it can be in another 10.",

It's getting much easier to buy bitcoin, and the technical level of entry required is lowering. Add to that an entire new generation of tech savvy investors about to come online.

Well I suppose you can Google and copy/paste but most of you people who enjoy bashing bitcoin have very little insight on what you're even taking about. It was bad 4 or 5 years ago when the price dropped and the oh so sad people gathered some sort of self validation by telling us all that bitcoin was a 'fad'. A 'fad' they said! Oh now it's been 10 years and there is no definition of a fad that exceeds weeks or months. So you want to call Bitcoin bullshit hey? Do you feel better?

Ultimately there is no real benefit to anyone in the scheme other than the above way so the chain breaks at some point. \n\nWith Bitcoin, the asset in question has an immediate benefit of giving you a defined proportion of a fixed supply that cannot be manipulated, a secure way of making trustless payments and an asset that cannot be confiscated. Knowing all these benefits, you also gain by virtue of adoption of this fixed supply by increasing number of people and thus causing appreciation of your holding. \n\nSo unlike a pyramid scheme, there is an immediate gain of holding Bitcoin and also a justified reason to expect appreciation.

But now that the hype is over, and people start seeing Bitcoin's true value at the moment, there's absolutely no reason to invest, that's why it's declining all the time.

My point, if you had taken the time to process what I wrote, as that many people evaluate future potential only on current state of a technology. This has been a big mistake multiple times throughout history, and it could very well end up being a mistake with some people's complacent stance on technologies like bitcoin. This whole market price thing has led people away from the fact that Bitcoin is an exceptionally secure and stable netork that maintains itself via perfect math. Maybe you don't see the value in that for potential future applications, but I believe it holds much value. We shall see over the next decade or so. Perhaps I am wrong, but at least open your mind.",

All the altcoins, all the ICOs that failed, the entire crypto market.. is because of Bitcoin.\n\nRemember back in the dot com days, when everyone would attach dot com to their business names to see their share price soar, only to crash and burn within the same year? Well that's EXACTLY what happened with blockchain. Businesses over this past year attached the buzzword blcokchain to their name and watched their share prices soar only to crash soon after. But Bitcoin ..like the internet ..is still here and the bitcoin blockchain grows stronger and stronger. Lightning network, side chains, growing dev community etc. I have no intention of being rude here, I simply want to correct you because you are after all, on a bitcoin Reddit sub. I'm sure there are many things I don't know, like all of us. But I can tell you this: Bitcoin is what will survive all of this, and all of us.",

But Bitcoin is infinitely divisible so the sustainable gains come due to adoption by growing number of people buying a smaller and smaller proportion of the supply for the same fiat amount. So this doesn't require you to be in search of people with higher and higher amounts of fiat in their pockets. \n\nAnd you talk of dividend being the benefit of a stock. Here it is a different benefit - that of being an unconfiscateable asset that can be transferred trustlessly and whose total supply won't change.

I am not here to tell you that Bitcoin is a zero risk vehicle but rather telling you my view on some of the supposed risks. I do have some alt coins though BTC is lion's share and M is lion's share of the remaining. The proportion I have in alt coins is based on my assessment of the probability that they may end up with a valuable network. I don't claim it is absolute zero for other coins but at the same time it is not that any new coin or fork starts on an equal footing and immediately dilutes Bitcoin.",

Say you had 20k in bitcoin and decided to take 10k out to buy something then woke up the next day and only had 10k left because it crashed. That's not a store of value. Crypto is not different then the stock market, the more money invested the higher the price moves up. Now a smart person I know is some old lady that lives near me and she invested over 50 years ago and only invested in companies that gave dividends and has been living off them for who knows how long.
