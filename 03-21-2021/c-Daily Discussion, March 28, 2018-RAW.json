Many people who invested in December got out or are holding on for dear life. People who got in early either know the game and HODL or sold to get a nice gain. People sitting on the sidelines are comfortable waiting to see a clear move in either direction. Most weak hands have sold by now.\n\nLong term I believe in bitcoin not only as an investment but as a solid alternative to conservative monetary systems. For any major move upwards, media coverage has to pick up again and we need a few weeks of a solid upward trend.\n\nSo instead of checking the price every five minutes I am now trying to do more reading on the tech side and explore how I can actually contribute to Bitcoin and cryptos as a whole. Because ultimately, the motor that is driving bitcoin is the community that has to develop bitcoin into a valid currency for daily usage or a solid store of value.\n\nWhere do you see the future? Is bitcoin gonna be digital gold or can it be a serious currency?\n\nEdit: sorry for long text but just trying to get a discussion going that involves more than moon and doom.\n\n",

I watched a bunch of videos you guys sent me, and I understand that having a bank-free currency is great, but what I don't get, is that the currency price is based on the US dollar, and that other currencies globally are also based on the US dollar. If I purchase one US dollar Bitcoin at $8,000, and then sell it into Zimbabwe dollars, you still come out with the same (based on the USD) equivalency. \n\nThe fact that it (price) goes up and down, makes no sense to me, as it's then based on demand? Or value of the dollar? And if it becomes the global standard, how does one Bitcoin labor hour of debt in the USA become 8000x the labor hour of Zimbabwe, when it's a global currency?\n\nAlso, how do you go to a bitcoin bank, and borrow for a mortgage? Is there someone who takes US dollars (a bank) and buys bitcoin, to loan you bitcoin to buy a house, and you pay back then at the current price? What happens if it goes way down, do you then pay more or less depending on the value of the dollar, if you are getting paid in dollars? I have so many questions. It just seems so much like a fad to me because it's overly complicated, especially when the US Government can print a trillion in paper and then use that to give to Iran, Israel, and other countries as 'aid'. None of it makes any sense when those currencies have no real value.",

The market should have improved by mid-April.\n\nI expect to see a revisit to 9k within a week or so, which would mean a decent 15% profit from 7.8k. In a less optimal scenario I might have to wait 1-2 weeks extra. That's fine, I don't need fast returns. My main bitcoin stash is for long-term holding for 2-5 years.\n\nIt appears that the bounces have been adamant at around 7.7k. A similar scenario played out during the last dip to 7.3k; at 2.5% over the McAfee prediction line it seemed like bots bought up bitcoins and consumed the fall successfully. It was just a bit hilarious to watch it happen again, at 2.5% over the McAfee line, when certain traders were so certain to revisit 7.3k - 7.5k.\n\nThe McAfee line will fall one day, though that day is not today. Nor is it tomorrow or around the corner.",

Plus, the US Government can print more dollars at will, and give it to Pakistan, or Israel at a moment's notice, and while it devalues it, it contains power central to a government's success. Nobody can print bitcoins and just hand it over, because there shouldn't be any devalue or value of Bitcoin either. If it were to truly become a global standard, then all labor hours would equal Think about that for a second. A 'labor hour' would be the same globally. Countries and rich people FUNCTION on maintaining a labor and fiscal imbalance. Slavery, whether economic, or physical, is still a means of control and wealth building. All global economies would come crashing down if one labor hour in America was equal to one labor hour in China or Zimbabwe. \n\nIt's not going to happen in my life time. It's not going to happen in your life time. This is a pipe dream as big as Communism was in the 60's. It sounded good on paper, but it really wasn't that good. The same will happen with bitcoin.

Alone the word \"gold\" inspires strong feelings.\n\nBitcoin can't deliver that. Only if it becomes a strong currency, it will gain value. Then maybe one day, after a phase of strong utility, it might be valued for sentimal reasons and scarcity alone. When other digital currencies have surpassed it. \n\nBut certainly not now.",

            "Text": ">what I don't get, is that the currency price is based on the US dollar, and that other currencies globally are also based on the US dollar. If I purchase one US dollar Bitcoin at $8,000, and then sell it into Zimbabwe dollars, you still come out with the same (based on the USD) equivalency.\n\nThis is correct, but only because the USD is the global [reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency). This largely came about due to the domination of the American economy at the time and is liable to change. Perhaps bitcoin will be the future reserve currency. \n\n>The fact that it (price) goes up and down, makes no sense to me, as it's then based on demand? Or value of the dollar? \n\nIt is based on demand. It is no different to regular [Foreign Exchange](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=EUR&view=10Y) and is impacted by all sorts of things (economy, politics, travel etc etc).\n\n>And if it becomes the global standard, how does one Bitcoin labor hour of debt in the USA become 8000x the labor hour of Zimbabwe, when it's a global currency?\n\nI'm not sure I understand what you're asking here. By \"labor hour\" you mean the cost of labor which is already vastly different across the globe. \n\n>Also, how do you go to a bitcoin bank, and borrow for a mortgage? Is there someone who takes US dollars (a bank) and buys bitcoin, to loan you bitcoin to buy a house, and you pay back then at the current price? \n\nWell, the answer is that you can't. That doesn't mean that it's not likely in the future once the adoption rate has increased and it is more stable. \n\n>It just seems so much like a fad to me because it's overly complicated\n\nAs was the internet which was also routinely dismissed as a 'fad'. Read [this](https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2010/02/27/newsweek-1995-buy-books-newspapers-straight-intenet-uh/) interesting piece about a Newsweek article from 1995. Even the inventor of [ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe#Incorrect_predictions) gave the internet a shelf-life of 12 months!\n\nRemember, we are still at the very early stages. I know, I know, it has been 10 years. Just to put it into context, the internet was originally conceived in the '60s and wasn't ready for release to the masses until tcp/ip was invented in 1983. The world wide web wasn't invented until 1990 and look at it now. By the way, the internet has always been plagued by scaling issues and it has always adapted (because it's decentralised, perhaps?). \n\nThe concept of \"digital money\" is a very difficult one to grasp when the entirety of human civilisation has been built on the trade and commerce of tangible currencies and units of barter however, we are more open to digitisation than ever before and we are only going to become more so. It is inevitable. \n",

Somehow with thousands of people more involved, overall good news for crypto and 2 months with heavy fud crashes where it never got below $6000, he thinks it might go $3500. At $6000 I will sell my house, wife , cars, boat and borrow every $ I can get my hands on and so will thousands of other people like me, and buy the crap out of it. Good luck getting to $5000 much less $3500.",

            "Text": "Consider how dumb the average person is, though... they have no idea that inflation (THEFT!) is slowly eating away their dollars while Uncle Sam is laughing all the way to the bank (in this case, the FED). The stock marked is crashing HARD. As soon as people realize how worthless their unbacked, fundamentally worthless FIAT is they will flock to crypto like the sheep that they are. Let them pay higher prices (I estimate bitcoin will be at 30k by the time the outdated stock market crashes) to the STRONG HANDS who have kept crypto alive for the last 10 years. They can eat their ramen and take the bus  while we early adopters drive our lambos and save the world with the new crypto economy. ",

            "Text": "Thankyou for taking the time to answer. I think the issue I have with Bitcoin is it's a lot like communism. On paper, it sounds like a good hypothetical, just as Bitcoin does, but in practice, not so much. Imagine if countries couldn't print currencies? They couldn't do shady dealings around the world. They couldn't free hostages, move weapons, bribe whomever, etc. So countries NEED their own printable currency. So, while there may be a bitcoin backbone, or blockchain backbone, what does that really do, if the US dollar is the backbone? While you guess that the US dollar might not be in the far future, currency differences need to be there in order for countries to operate. If we have one global currency, then countries too, cease to exist because power is in the currency, wealth, and army. \n\nI agree that maybe in 100 years, it could happen, but that would mean banks somehow give up control, and I am not sure how we would get mortgages, borrow for auto finance, and do other things without Banks and interest. \n\nI am still interested in purchasing it, but I don't understand how it's value can change if it is a global currency. If that is the case, is there a part of the world, where I can exchange Dollars to Zimbabwe and then Zimbabwe to Bitcoin, where the price is different from Zimbabwe to Bitcoin? Or, is all currency, including bitcoin, based on the dollar?",

            "Text": ">Thankyou for taking the time to answer.\n\nNo problems. This is a completely new era we're entering and no one really knows what's going to happen. Ergo, we're all here to learn and to make the best guesses we can. Full disclosure - I'm a bitcoin maximalist because everything I've learned so far is guiding me to be such. This doesn't, however, mean that I won't learn something *tomorrow* that will cause me to rethink my beliefs. \n\n>Imagine if countries couldn't print currencies? They couldn't do shady dealings around the world. They couldn't free hostages, move weapons, bribe whomever, etc. So countries NEED their own printable currency. \n\nI assume that you're not exactly condoning these shady dealings, rather asserting that they \"need\" to be carried out. If this is the case, it's a sad state of affairs. Perhaps a decentralised-ledger-based currency will force honesty through transparency. Don't you think it's worth a shot? \n\nEither way, I think that it would be quite naive to assume that the powers of the world won't adapt. Bad things will continue to happen. \n\nIrrespective of that, even if BTC is the reserve currency, who's to say that countries won't continue to print their own? Paper money is not going away for a long, long (long) time. Current older generations need to die off before we can realistically consider going completely digital. I'm late-thirties and would consider myself in that bracket.\n\n>If we have one global currency, then countries too, cease to exist because power is in the currency, wealth, and army.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with this. Clearly, countries won't collapse - they will just be forced to adapt. \n\n>I agree that maybe in 100 years, it could happen, but that would mean banks somehow give up control, and I am not sure how we would get mortgages, borrow for auto finance, and do other things without Banks and interest.\n\nYou don't think that banks would simply adapt? They could offer crypto-vault services with their own hot wallet apps, offering indemnity for the less tech-savvy amongst us. Why would loans disappear? You're focusing on the instability of the currency here and are being short-term minded. \n\n>I am still interested in purchasing it, but I don't understand how it's value can change if it is a global currency. If that is the case, is there a part of the world, where I can exchange Dollars to Zimbabwe and then Zimbabwe to Bitcoin, where the price is different from Zimbabwe to Bitcoin? \n\nSorry but I'm not really sure what you're asking. Can you reword  your question?\n\n>Or, is all currency, including bitcoin, based on the dollar?\n\nAgain, all currency is based on the dollar as the dollar is the global reserve currency. Other currencies have been the reserve at various points in the past so this could easily change. If the idea of BTC becoming the reserve is unpalatable, perhaps the idea of the EURO taking over makes more sense.\n\n",

With their hardware investment and projected ROI they add a natural anchoring to the price. This is why I think that quick ascents are not going to hold very well. A slower rise will be better anchored in mining infrastructure investments.\n\nThough, I enjoy hearing different opinions of price projections and I won't brush aside a June spike as impossible, I just don't see 30k anytime soon.",

If we went to a block-chain system, everyone worldwide would find a way to hack or crack it, even if it meant due to the speed over the internet, much in the way the Stock Exchange got rigged over a 50 nanosecond delay due to one broker being closer to the servers than another, allowing him to essentially rig the price to those outside the delay.

All I am saying is that college kids are taking money from their families who gave it to them for expenses or whatever and are investing in bitcoin. Shit they are using money from student loans to invest. And sure it doesnt seem like alot but a few millions students do that and yes it effects the market. Its not an outrageous idea and all the little butthurt cryptos in here that wanna blame whales for every dip can go on bitching about how they dont have any money because the whales are taking it. Anonymous internet conversation is so ridiculous. ",

I think that this is ridiculously pessimistic and that you are going to be very, very surprised. \n\n>banks will find a way to dismiss bitcoin, and create their own.\n\nBitcoin is *trustless* because it is decentralised. There is no way the masses would choose a centralised currency over a decentralised one. You're talking about a currency with *at least* one less feature than bitcoin. \n\n>Remember, banks and wealthy elites MUST own everything.\n\nI agree, they must. The advent of bitcoin has been the first time in history that there has been such an opportunity for so large a transfer of wealth. We're already at the price levels where the average person can't afford 1 BTC. What a shame if more miss out because they can't see the wood for the trees. \n\n>If we went to a block-chain system, everyone worldwide would find a way to hack or crack it\n\nThat's the whole point. Bitcoin [can't](https://i.imgur.com/wRJPosw.jpg) be hacked. And remember, it can always be updated if necessary - it is a software protocol, after all. \n\n>much in the way the Stock Exchange got rigged over a 50 nanosecond delay due to one broker being closer to the servers than another, allowing him to essentially rig the price to those outside the delay\n\nVulnerabilities will always be exploited. Bitcoin removes a *lot* of vulnerabilities which currently exist in the financial system. \n\nBottom line, change is coming and you'll either remember bitcoin as a blip or you'll remember the time when some random guy on the internet engaged you in discussion and tried to assuage your concerns about an emerging technological advancement which took the world by storm.

How many coin projects have you participated in? I am advising on 3 different projects right now. One will revolutionize how the health care community distributes employee discounts via an on chain coupon/discount system with huge off chain ramifications as well. Another will not as revolutionary, but will disrupt Hollywood\u2019s grasp on movie theaters. It uses an on-chain, one-to-many micro transaction system to charge per second of theater time. If you don\u2019t like a movie, walk out and you only pay for the time spent I theater. It\u2019s called Cinetoken. Look it up. We have BIG backers from Hollywood. So before you educate ME on the blockchain, let me educate YOU on your lack of knowledge and in depth analysis of such things. It is an emerging technology with many subtleties that not everyone can grasp. It\u2019s ok, you will just be the ones without lambos, LOL! I will have one I each color. I might even buy a Ferrari just for the giggles.",
