Once institutions start entering the space en masse we\u2019ll start seeing real price discovery. Look at it this way. The California State Teacher\u2019s Retirement System had approximately $211 billion in assets under management last year. If they or another massive pension fund felt comfortable allocating 0.5% of their portfolio to bitcoin, that\u2019s a $1 BILLION allocation. At $6,300 per bitcoin, that would mean 167,460 bitcoin would have to trade. That\u2019s just one pension fund. It may seem unlikely now, but this is what most of the serious players in this space are working towards. ",

People traditionally look for a reason for Bitcoin price movements, and click bait content creators love this very fact. They profit from it and contribute to it, but playing on the public's need to have everything explained in black and white.

You bought in at a really bad time, and now you know what FOMO feels like. Don't FOMO next time, and don't FUD now. It's still a good time to buy more and lower your cost basis.

Now this is not a lot like traditional stocks, but consider how long technological innovations take to integrate with society. Personal computing, cell phones, digital cameras, the internet, online banking, eCommerce, etc. Bitcoin has been around just long enough that we can say there's a very good chance that it isn't going away.\n\nThe global infrastructure is growing more every day and cryptocurrencies are being considered for countless applications. In all fairness, it will take years for the space to mature, but that's a really good thing from an investment perspective - because you don't want to invest in it then, when it's already soared in value, you want to invest in it now while there's still enormous growth potential.\n\nAccumulate using money you can afford to take some risk with, and in a few years time you could be very thankful you did. The infrastructure will reach a point that allows easy on boarding of new investors, investment platforms and products will mature, and a new digital generation is about to jump in the game. Have patience and enjoy the ride.",

I am just trying to show what a 0.5% portfolio allocation would look like in terms of bitcoin trading volume at today\u2019s prices to put things in perspective. Over the past 30 days volume was slightly under 80k bitcoin across all exchanges. That is ridiculously low compared with what volume/price would do once these big firms start taking real positions. Wall Street largely stood on the sidelines during the last run up. These guys experience FOMO just like everyone else, and will not miss a chance to outperform the S&P once the herd mentality shifts and the next real run up begins. When exactly that happens is largely a function of the adequacy of the regulatory environment that needs to mature to support their participation. ",

All the people who are 'sooooo tired of HODLing an asset that only has lost value' since they bought it....when they finally throw in the towel, sell pressure will evaporate and a bull market will likely begin to form. No offense intended.  That's just generally how speculative markets work.\n\nIf you're seeking words of wisdom from some of the same people who said it wouldn't go below 10K, 9K, 6.5K, etc., then you're investing in hope rather than Bitcoin.  Nobody knows exactly when the market will turn, and as long as a good chunk of the hodlers are desperately holding out hope that a bull market is imminent, it probably won't be.  Markets like to inflict the maximum pain possible, and when there's more sustained pain to inflict on bears than bulls, then we might start seeing bullish behavior.\n\nOr when an ETF gets approved.

It's a game of exponential volume increases at the end of the day and when this shit kicks in, you are going to have one hell of a time trying to explain your way out of your current stance. I'm telling you, forget everything you think you know about the traditional stock space and embrace where this is headed. You'll thank yourself. ",

I plan to continue because I have accepted that nobody knows shit about where the price will be from one month to the next, but it always ends up a few steps higher than it was eventually. Look, you may think you got under my skin, and if that equates to some accomplishment to you, then I'm fine with you believing something that preposterous...though I suggest you set the bar higher. Truth is I'm gonna be here and continue to work and monitor Reddit and many many other sources until I retire so think what you want of my reddit presence ... I'm doing what I always do regardless of your opinions. Enjoy your day.",

Most people who don't feel the future of Bitcoin is bright, usually resort to whale manipulation, tether theories, or use the mechanics of a traditionally traded stock or ETF to try and explain how a similar platform in the crypto space will fail. This space is chaotic, unpredictable and in these early days, easy to take advantage of. I fully believe this is typical behavior for a rising technology, let alone a tech that is open source and non centralized.   \nIf I hear something that hasn't already been said before the last correction and reversal, I'll be sure to offer my take on it ...for what little it's worth.",
