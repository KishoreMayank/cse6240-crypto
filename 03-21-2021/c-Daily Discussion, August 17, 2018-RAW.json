            "Text": "Most of the info in here is based on BS and price junk talk. I'm not sure why so many people are oblivious to the fact, or what it means, but the physically delivered ICE Bitcoin futures coming in November is going to hit like a shock wave once people clue in. The Bitcoin will be purchased, and taken from the existing supply, then stored in ICE\u2019s regulated Digital Asset Warehouse. Add to that the fact that the trading, which will be on their electronic trading platform, will be regulated by the CFTC.\n\nIf you don't understand why this is HUGE, here's the thing: The current Futures contracts are not using actual Bitcoin, they just wager on the future price of Bitcoin. So no Bitcoin investment is made and thus no impact on the price other than the unproven theories of manipulation being carried out by some assholes with no life and too much monetary power for their tiny brains to use productively. This new ICE Futures will actually BUY BITCOIN ..meaning price increase. It could be the start of an incredible bull run. They have openly admitted that they've been working on this on the down low, so as to not create too much hype too soon... and to have a tasty entry point to stockpile BTC.\n\nAnyway, hopefully anyone invested enough to be in here already knows this, but in case you did not ... forget about the bullshit and trivial day to day price, and the trivial shorting on a few hundred dollars, and focus on the big prize. ACCUMULATE.",

I think its quite an insightful article as it really shows you the size of cryptocurrency markets and not just what we believe it is from the figures given from Coincapmarket. The cryptocurrency market is at least double in size considering that the OTC Market for Crypto is bigger than that of traditional exchanges. What are your thoughts? Can this lead to market manipulation?\n",

I assumed any significant premium shrinking would accompany an ETF approval that would boost the BTC price and be somewhat of a wash for GBTC's price.  But instead the ETN hasn't gained as much attention or boosted BTC's price as much as a widely reported ETF approval likely would, so I seem to be getting the short end of this stick.\n\nI generally avoid ETNs because of the credit risk, and I haven't yet looked into the issuer to gain comfort with that risk.  I guess it's time to look into them before the premium decays more.",

And you also get favorable capital gains treatment as if it were stock upon sale, not taxed like property at ordinary income rates when kept in a wallet.  So that can make a huge difference come tax time, at least in the United States.  Also, the IRS seems more interested in exchange held coins and unreported coin trading than in the more typical GBTC investor that buys and holds in a brokerage, so less chance of audit.",
