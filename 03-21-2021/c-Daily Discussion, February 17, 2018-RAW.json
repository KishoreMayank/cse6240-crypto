Just look at the previous bounces. The last move up before the big drop always struggles to go past the first wave of bounce.

            "Text": "Newb question.  I set in a buy order for when a certain coin fell to a certain price.  It went through.  I have another buy order for when it drops to another price.  I also have a sell order for when that coin reaches a certain price.  But for some reason, I can't set another sell order beyond it (I'm trying to layer my sells).  Is it . cause I don't have the coin in my account because I haven't bought it yet?  I'm using binance.  I know it sounds like a stupid question and it is, and I know the answer is something simple, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.  Say I put a buy order for 12 coins at .917.  It went through.  Now I have another buy order at .91 for 12 more.  It hasn't went through yet.  Not I have a sell order at .96 for 12 coins.  But now I can't place another sell order at .97 because it won't let me.  Is that because I don't have the coins in my possession.   Please, be gentle.",

But one thing I am working out is how far apart to gauge buys.\n\nE.g. 10% of available $$ at $100 increments (the increment being the price drop)?  15% of available reserves invested in $300 increments?\n\nI am probably much more conservative on buys than sells - I might buy back in with 8-10 steps... but sell out in 2-3 steps.\n\nOpinions?  Thoughts?  Given the current dip?\n\nOh, and when Moon?",

Yes those altcoin are innovation, but is innovation in scams 99%.  \n\n>Does price manipulation play a big role in the volatility of bitcoin?  \n\nYES! Many trades on exchanges are made by hedge funds, banks, big players, that have large amount of funds at disposal so they move the price as they pleased. Let's not ignore the fact that behind all these big players are also \"manipulators\" with connections/owners in media. The today's FUD is at extreme level.",

If I have 1 BTC and $10,000, I'd rather use my u.s dollars that in my mind are worth less than my Bitcoin. The same thing happened with gold and silver coins, people chose to get rid of their silver coins rather than gold and silver became a better medieval currency because of it",

(keywords are deflation/credit supply/volatility)\neconomy must work with deflation, credit supply (or a new form of pre-finance) must be secured and volatility must go down with increasing rate of adoption.",

The reasons why BTC has failed as a currency is well understood.  Which is why most proponents of BTC are emphasising that it's value is actually being a good store of value.  That is of course nonsense as the preservation of value is eventually to be used as a currency in the future.\n\nAnd no, we are not in uncharted territory.  That's the most common argument during every known bubble and the underlying reason is actually denial.  ",

Other than that, get a hardware wallet: trezor or ledger, and do some reading about how to store and restore from seeds. Maybe invest in a small home safe to store written seeds if you're investing a very large amount.",

Will you stay alert about the price even when most media outlets stop giving a shit because it's low and has low volume?\n\nIf yes, then you can maybe wait. If not, yes, I believe it is still a good time to get in. We are far from ATH and volume shows that we are far from fomo. I believe in bitcoin so I believe any entrypoint now is better than no entrypoint at all. Of course, only with money you can afford to lose if things go south. ",

That's insane. It is dozens of ever shifting use cases, not the least of which is the worlds most decentralized ledger. Nothing makes the use case you envision special or privileged over the others. Sometimes use cases even go in and out of viability, like we saw with free transaction based services. \n\nBitcoin is not a use case, it is  a network. This is why Roger freaked out, he sees *only* a use case in cheap global transactions. All other use cases are irrelevant to him. When bitcoin stopped enabling services like satoshis dice it was the loss of everything he cared about. Learn a lesson from Roger, don't expect Bitcoins use cases to be static and don't define Bitcoin as a use case.",

            "Text": "How is it different? In what meaningful way? More potential exposure after a bull or bear run? \n\nNo matter what, an increase in volume will always equate in a lower volatility in the long term and I don't see how being in the spotlight can hurt adoption, ever. Also, same argument (\"It's mainstream now! It's different!\") has been raised every single time it had a big fall after a big rise. Truth is, maybe \"bitcoin\" is more known now by the mass, but it's still only bought by very few, because it's tedious as hell to get validated anywhere you can actually buy online. Until it's as easy as buying something on amazon or ebay for a newcomer, it will still not be mainstream. It will only get easier and easier to buy in tho, and every exposure wave means new people that couldnt buy last time because validation took forever until it crashed and scared them, who will be validated when the next fomo kicks in.",

If everyone only holds onto it and doesn't use it, it will be replaced by another altcoin that people do use, and its \"value\" will plummet. Nowhere in Satoshi's whitepaper does he describe any use for it as a store of value. Fortunately, there are other people who actually believe in it as a currency, which balances out the stupid \"just hodl\" advice most of this subreddit pushes and keeps your value positive.

That said CB has it set to be somewhat misleading to those who don't know any better and I lost a lot of gains by not using GDAX sooner. \n\nsimilarly, I understand what you're saying about needing to buy right away and CB being the only way to do that without having cash on GDAX for *feeless* (!) market buys, but in general, excluding very rare (and short-lived) circumstances like the recent dip to the 5k's and such, you're **always better off planning ahead, transfering your fiat to GDAX (waiting is part of this) and having your money for when you want to make a buy. usually a given price doesn't only occur once within a short (1 day) period of time, barring rapid rises / falls, so if you're patient, plan ahead, and are organized, you can avoid this frustration going forward** \n\nI don't mean to sound critical or condescending, this is just what i've learned / come to feel after a fairly long period of playing this game ",
