This sounds like something off Billy Madison...\u201dwhat you just said...may God have mercy on your soul.\u201d Low volume and extremely low volatility isn\u2019t a good sign. Where are you getting this notion from? Are you just satisfied you aren\u2019t losing Bitcoin value in significant amounts because it\u2019s extremely dormant these days? I would rather have volatility so I can recover my funds. But low volume particularly is terrible. Bitcoin needs high volume to prove that it\u2019s more than just an asset and instead what it was designed to be...a currency. Cash has high volume per day because it\u2019s a currency. Bitcoin is not a currency yet.",

I've never seen these things as entertaining... especially the 2008 stock market crisis or the 2014 crypto bear with the Mt Gox drama.

I have several close friends that are house builders and contractors and yes, they do very well. I was simply addressing the crazy logic the OP positioned. Of course not everyone would be wealthy because the vast majority would not want to take the risk.  Are you offended that I used the word vision? I'm sure you know I meant there. Just that the small few that take the risk of investing early and are the ones that benefit if that risk pays off. This has absolutely nothing to do with house builders, that's just the example OP used.\nSeems you're just looking for something to criticize.\n\nYou want to get nit picky? How about the massive lack of understandimg demonstrated in OPs post regarding distribution of Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin were to be valued at 1 million per coin, that's equivalent to only 1 cent per satoshi. What he's implying about everyone becoming rich is ridiculous. By the time bitcoin could be used as a mainstream currency and distributed among the global population, any opportunity to own even 1 Bitcoin would be very small compared to today.",

Also I hate the fact that you improperly use the word \u201cfundamentally.\u201d If you don\u2019t understand what a word means, don\u2019t use it. What the hell does fundamentally broken mean? Basically you can call anything \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d in hindsight. My poop was not fundamentally broken until I witnessed it get split in two. Then poopie was fundamentally broken.

Look Bitcoin's network value is almost limitless. It's about accounting. Gold was chosen years ago, long before we evolved into a digital society and if you think future generations will choose something dug out of the ground only to bury it in a vault again and call a value placeholder over Bitcoin I think you're wrong. Bitcoin does a much better job of accounting and record keeping. You just don't see value because you are trying to compare it to value as it applies to older systems. \n\nIf everyone thought that way no inovation would ever happen. We'd be stuck in the past forever. Ask any large corporation how much value they'd place in a secure, stable accurate network that has been running with 99.9% uptime for a decade. Anyone that doesn't see the value in Bitcoin is intentionally choosing to ignore it.",
