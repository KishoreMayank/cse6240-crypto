These are smart people.. they knew it was going to cause a lot of volatility and the crash when launched out of nowhere like that. And then you look at the price of BCH since yesterday and clearly there was some insider knowledge there.\n\n\nCombine those two factors and it looks almost intentional. All very peculiar execution and timing on their part.\n\nHow do you position yourself as a serious exchange when you just do things willy nilly? Institutional investors are probably wondering WTF is going on right now.\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nFurthermore, the price of BCH is so conveniently frozen at 9500 USD leaving novice users to think that is a normal price.",

I bought $100 at an ATH (19.7), and it's currently sitting at 18.2. \n\nThat's fine, I can deal with the dip, but I'm wondering if it was worth it to invest so little so late? I think that's 0.005 of a single BTC. The return on that, even if it hit $100k wouldn't be as significant as if I put that $100 into LTC or ETH and that went up just a couple thousand.\n\nSo unless we're buying whole coins or large percentages of a coin at a time, would it be better for newbs to invest elsewhere for now?\n\nThanks for any honest answers! I'm new to investing in general, so still trying to figure out how it all works.",

However - and this may be an error - the error shows a decreasing frequency. like its trending towards stability.  I need to figure out what the hell I am looking at but thats interesting.  I've not tried this before so not sure if this is the right interpretation.\n\n\n2. there is room for 5-7 cryptos to exist and thrive.  Asymmetry goes crazy after 7 but seems to start at 5 hence my range.  Im talking global here btw.  No idea about local - too hard to reconfigure for this.  It could be the asymmetry is a function of the algorithm but thought id share in any case. \n\nInteresting. \n\nIf you have a model that can do this and is showing similar things (or opposite :) ) let me know. Would be cool to compare notes. ",

We keep hearing that it'll come in time, after proper planning, but there doesn't seem to be an open dialogue about when and how, and the bitcoin network is basically unusable at this point as a currency.\n\nI am so excited about Lightning Network, but the transactions made to open and close channels will be prohibitively expensive and the entire thing will be a non-starter if we don't increase the block size soon.\n\nI'd be perfectly okay with getting news from CoinBase about Segwit so that the blocksize increase we kinda-sorta have could finally be implemented on a larger percentage of transactions... but in all honesty, it won't be enough.\n\nWe need action. There is a reasonable range that can allow us a blocksize increase without centralization, and we should be at the very least talking about it.",

I realized I found my moon, and I keep a pawn in the game so i don't hate myself if the market quadruples in a year from now or loses 90% value in a month. I was one of those members of the 21 BTC club, and sadly I had to leave it but stress was keeping me up at night and I was unable to do any proper work. Remember, value your mental health and never hate yourself for taking profit.\n\nReally tried to avoid taking the dip, but as volatile as the market is, i wanted out, and in the end what matters is that I made profit :). I bought at about little 10-12% below the ATH, which isn't too bad I guess though.\n",

But having your own nation's currency go into deflation is basically rat poison for the economy. See Japan, for example. If bitcoin were to replace fiat, you'd basically see Japan's lost decades on crack because no one would want to actually use their bitcoins for transactions more than they need to.",

            "Text": "Currently staring at a 14 hour old transaction of mine that is still yet to get even one confirmation, it's hard to give a fuck about the debate around SegWit and block sizes and Lightning network and multi-layer and so-called attacks or what have you when, right now, practically speaking, the chain is completely useless to me unless I am willing to overspend massively on fees.\n\n\n\n\nIt's tough to care about ideological purity or long-term or \"the right way to do things.\" It was wrong and stubborn to reject SegWit2X. It was the perfect solution. Bumping the block size modestly would've helped tremendously for the blockchain. SegWit is not some perfect solution, the fact it requires mass adoption and doesn't just flip on and automatically start working is very evident as a flaw.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe in six months or a year when (we hope) the Lightning network stuff is working and SegWit is being used even more I'll have long since forgotten about this era, but as of right now Bitcoin is dramatically failing for my practical use. \n\n\n\nThe price does not bother me. It goes up, it goes down. I bought at $50, I bought at the first time it crossed $1000, I bought that dip, I've bought since then. I am numb to that kinda thing. But what I'm not numb to is: excessive fees and arduously long transaction times. Price is fuck all, usability is king, and if Bitcoin's devs continue to ignore the problem then the chain is going to die. End of story. In a perfect world they would have all the time they need to fix stuff, but we don't live in that world. This needed to be fixed half a year ago, and instead I just have to deal with the chain getting grossly congested and locking up. Seriously, what the fuck?",

However this has not been confirmed yet (After 12 DAYS!!). My question is what I can do to speed up the transaction?\n\nI transacted them from a nano ledger s wallet (Btw, it says \"**Current chain** Bitcoin Segwit\", and I sent them to a binance wallet. Is this a problem?). I read about a double spending solution, like sending the same bitcoin again but with a higher attached fee. This seemingly cannot be done on the ledger wallet though. I read that you could perhaps solve it by using the electrum wallet with the ledger instead, but when I try to connect the ledger to electrum, it just says: \"Electrum cannot pair with your Ledger. Before you request bitcoins to be sent to addresses in this wallet, ensure you can pair wih your device, or that you have its seed (and passphrase, if any). Otherwise all bitcoins you receive will be unspendable.\" I haven't been able to figure out this problem.\nAny help, to speed up the transaction (or cancel it somehow, which I guess can't be done though) would be appreciated! :)",

I then close Bitcoin Core and take that wallet.dat offline for safekeeping after the transaction is completed. I've done this at least once successfully this year. I've saved all the wallet.dat files.\n\nIt's my understanding that the bitcoin I own that dates from before the BCH fork can be redeemed for both BTC and BCH.\n\nQuestion 1: How would I go about tapping into the BCH?\n\nQuestion 2: I've transferred some BTC from my stash to Coinbase and sold it for fiat already.

I'm just too lazy sitting on a 3x investment (pretty low for bitcoin's history) in the most important currency in the world.\n\nI would also like to remind you that the point of Bitcoin is to give common people like us the power to use our money (our hard work, time, studies) however the fuck we want without unnecessary, unfair and often illogical boundaries and restrictions. If you think of Bitcoin as a get rich scheme and simply panic sells everytime there's a correction, you're just giving all that power to whales and people that in the future will use that control against YOU. \n\nBitcoin is a gift of mankind's ability to solve complicated problems and overcome our own biological and mental limitations. You're just giving it away due to greed and fear. It's funny how so many people post how they suddenly got rich when they realized they had btc stored and simply forgot, without greed and fear, saved by their ignorance (in a good way in this case).\n\nGo ahead guys... Panic sell. Hopefully hodlers like us will protect you in the future. Sounds corny, but never forget Bitcoin is liberty. Yes... Liberty.\n",

I haven't started mining just yet cause I was wanting to use nicehash when it came back up unless soneone knew of a better alternative that shows daily earnings as I'm mining and can benchmark my pc.\n\nNow the question about the wallet is that I wouldnt be making very much starting out (about $45 a month with my current build) so was thinking something I can use on my pc and my phone would suffice for now and once I build a better rig that can earn me more get a hardware wallet (though don't fully understand them like how often to plug it in and add more to it). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

            "Text": "Hello! Sorry for being a noob. I sent 0.1 bitcoin this morning to binance from cex.io. On the CEX.IO side I got a confirmation email, however there is nothing on Binance and when I go into it (nothing on my history), it says that my transaction is unconfirmed, when I go through the link via CEX.IO. Could anyone put my mind at ease? Is there anyway of knowing if the BTC will ever arrive in my Binance account? I'm slightly freaking out. All the times I've sent money over in the last week, it only took 10-15 minutes to see the money in Binance, so I don't know what I did differently today. Any help, would be very much appreciated! Thanks!!",

Don't over or under invest. \n\nIf you don't have money for the next week means you have over invested or* basically went all in.\n\nHave an attitude where you win either way.\n\nWhen BTC goes down, its great cause you get to bring your average buying price lower.\n\nWhen it goes up, your BTC gains value against Fiat. Don't let that* stop you from your periodic DCA/BCA purchases as accumulation phase is vastly underrated. \n\nHaving substantial skin in the game with 5 to 10X is way better than dumping just a $100 bill with 100X. Aim for the prior and let your dreams take care of the latter. \n\nHappy Hodlidays!\n\nEdit: Feel free to reply back with any doubts or a silly sounding question that you have. I'm more than happy to publicly assist you with an investment plan.\n\n",

            "Text": "Bitcoin would have to grow x50 to be the same size as gold. That might happen, it might not, but it illustrates that the potential for a lot of growth is still very much there. Ultimately I see the current crypto market like the dotcom bubble. Most coins that exist currently will die out, but the ones that remain (the Google or Amazon) will be worth a lot more than anything currently. What you invest your money in though is really a personal decision. I would do some reading about the different coins and see if you really believe in any of them on a fundamental 'this technology is groundbreaking and definitely has a future' kind of way rather than a 'this currency just doubled in value, if I put my money in it maybe it'll double again' kind of way. That's what you should be investing in. Remember to also take into account things like market cap and supply when valuing an asset (e.g. Bitcoin has a total supply of 21 million, ethereum's supply increases by a set amount every year - it does a lot more technologically, but is not such a good store of value for this reason). You can also always spread your investment around.",

Korea's virtual currency exchanges Ebbit reportedly announced on Wednesday that they will close banks for closing the exchange.\n\nAccording to the Korean newspaper, the exchange seems to have stolen about 4,000 bit coins at the first hacking attack (April), which is believed to have involved North Korea.\n\nOn the website, the exchange announced that it lost 17% of the total assets under the hacking attack that became the second time this year at 4:35 am local time 19th. Although it does not clarify the details of the loss amount, it seems to explain that the evaluation value of the virtual currency assets of all customers is reduced to 75%. Also, the deal has already stopped.\n\nThe scale of Ubits in the Korean virtual currency market is relatively small, but it seems to be a negative material because it is conscious of the high risk of cyber attacks in the virtual currency.",

As that space is fixed and in demand, the going rate for a transaction is high right now.\n\nAs new technologies like SegWit and Lightning Network are adopted, some of this scarcity will be alleviated. Likewise, if the Bitcoin fever dies down a bit then there will not be as many transactions (regardless of price) so it will be easier to buy transaction space in a block.",

            "Text": ">Why do bitcoin transition fees and times keep going higher and higher? \n\nA limited number of transaction can fit into a single 1mb block. If there are a larger number of small transactions, or a small number of very large transactions (e.g. consolidating multiple addresses into one) there will be more transactions than can fit into a single block. In this event, transactions are prioritised in order of which pay the most to the miner (the miner can prioritise however they want, but it makes economic sense to receive the most in transaction fees as you can).   \nAs demand to send transactions grows, the more transactions are vying for the set amount of space, so the higher the fees get as people try and get to the top of the queue.\n\n>Is it possible for it to go back to old levels or is this inherent in the system to keep going up? \n\nYes. Either (1) demand for transactions reduces, and/or (2) transactions get smaller, and/or (3) the blocksize increases.\n\n1 can occur if the current rate of transactions is anomalous (e.g. if due to deliberate transaction spam, or due to demand from speculators that will reduce if price stabilises).\n\n2 can occur with technology upgrades like Segwit, or with layering extra networks 'on top of' Bitcoin like the Lightning network.\n\n3 has been attempted with forks like Bitcoin Cash, but that was not adopted by enough miners to achieve consensus. It is possible that a later attempt that gained agreement among all miners before forking could succeed, but increasing blocksize has some technical drawbacks (increased size of the blockchain, increased blockchain growth rate, increased bandwidth usage).",

            "Text": "**Rai stones**\n\nRai, or stone money (Yapese: raay), are large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed from aragonite and calcite crystals. Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau, but briefly on Guam as well, and transported for use as money to the island of Yap. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Depends on how much ammo the attackers are willing to spend on fees, etc. They have a big incentive to damage / hurt Bitcoin.  This is their last shot at taking down Bitcoin before the CB release of BCH so it could take a serious amount of time to return to \"normal.\"\n\nI am sorry if someone mislead you about Bitcoin's technology or the capabilities of its software. We are in alpha and there will be issues. But as long as you control your private keys, only you can create transactions for your controlled addresses.  The current dev team greatly prioritizes safety and security of the network over short term scalability issues (party due to the fact that it may be short term in nature. also very few people have implemented Segregated Witness, a technology that greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored directly on the Blockchain).",

I just found some old (pre-August 2017) paper wallets that were swiped into exchanges and digital wallets.  Since I wanted to learn how to deal with forks, I installed ElectronCash wallet after reading Electrum txt note and carefully swiped my forked bcash balances into blockchain.info and coinbase.\n\nThe transactions took less than a couple of minutes and cost a penny.\n\nYes, I get that the intentions behind bcash are less than scrupulous.  I read all the posts and know all the fud.  I know upsides/downsides of each fork.  I watch Andreas videos.  I get that bcash doesn't solve scaling, just pushes the can down the road while abusing patents via mining through ASIC Boost.\n\nBut this is not the first time a cabal of rich dudes succeeded in promoting an inferior product for their own enrichment.  Definitely something to think about.  I was very impressed with how fast and cheap bcash transactions were.\n\nOn a larger note, please look at things for what they are.  I remember when silver spiked to $35 from $15 a few years back, and all the stackers where saying LITERALLY THE SAME THING that goes on in this sub at this very moment.  In the end, silver and gold stayed flat for years and still haven't moved.",

You couldn't do another transaction from the old address A (which's tx got stuck) because after the transaction A should be empty and the change should go to another address C unless you manually set the A as the \"change address\" (which you can do with core, again don't know about leger). With 0 balance you can't do a double spending. You need first transfer more fund into A, and then just do another transaction with any amount and higher fees to B(has to be the same as the stuck one) from A, miners have to confirm the stuck one in order to get the higher fee from the new tx, which will get both confirmed.",

            "Text": "Another option is to send money to the coinbase USD account which takes however long your bank takes to guarantee the funds so about 1-2 weeks. and then when you decide to but its instant. However, if you're dead set on buying at a current price and are going to hodl anyway then waiting for the bank transfer will be the lowest fee you'll get through coinbase.\n\nAs far as the wallet goes there are phone ones, but because phones are almost always connected to the internet and easy to misplace it isn't good to store more in there than you would your physical wallet. You wouldn't walk around with your entire bank account on you at all times right? So the desktop isn't bad but its connection to the internet can be bad should you get some form of malware or virus on your pc bc they could steal your private keys which hold your bitcoin. I think doing a paper wallet and storing in a safe is probably the cheapest or looking into storing them on a thumbdrive or ordering an encrypted ledger wallet is solid too. something like a Trezor or Nano, but those will cost about $70-$100 for the added security, so it's all about how much you're trying to store based on how secure it really needs to be.\n",

            "Text": "nobody will answer you here because they don't know, they just came for the get rich quick meme scheme.\n\nLightning will help if opening and closing a channel is something you do rarely and then do all your transactions on lightning. This will remove some fee pressure from the blockchain so opening and closing will get cheaper or at least compete with how much people are willing to pay for on block transactions. so think about lightning as 2X the cost of a normal transaction. so it would be economically rational to open and close a channel as long as you do 3+ transactions on lightning. \n\nbut wait that only assumed bitcoin in isolation. Bitcoin is also in competition with traditional payments and other cryptocurrencies like bcash and monero which currently offer transactions for a tiny fraction of the cost of  what using lightning by opening and closing a channel would be.\n\nIt is complicated. Nobody knows how it will play out in the long term but bitcoin is useless as a currency now for any normal uses. Every non-fanatical non-ideological person i know is exiting bitcoin into eth, monero, and apparently bcash by the looks of the charts. Bitcoin devs seem to believe it is invincible and they are willing to drive it into the ground by not throwing us the bone of even a 2MB blocksize until further optimizations like schnorr and lightning.\n\nrant over",

The reason for that is that Coinbase does not allow you access to the private keys which give you control of your Bitcoin.  If you don't have access to your private keys, and Coinbase goes down, gets hacked, gets shut down by the government, or any other event, you lose access to your Bitcoin. Wallet software/hardware allow you access to your private keys there by giving you control and allowing you to restore access to your Bitcoin.",

Shit breaks, Vitalik rolls back his chain, etc. \n\nSo some people want to go real fast and not worry like silly things like centralization.  other people know there are a huge number of actors waiting for Bitcoin to reveal a momentary weakness.  When that weakness is revealed, they will try to slay Bitcoin, thus terribly setting back the crypto movement for at least our lifetime \n\n(watch if / as BTC makes massive falls, all other cryptos will also fall).  Shitcoiners think that by attackign Bitcoin, people will flow to their coins.  That is not true, people will exit the system completely in the short term.  it is too new for them.",

            "Text": "I said this in another discussion thread but it's the reason Im still mostly in BTC, and am talking for myself only... I sold my gold and bought Bitcoin a few years back as a hedge against my local currency, the CAD. That's why I bought gold originally; Bonds were (and still now) pay shit. I didn't want to 'all in' on stocks, so that was my hedge. \"One store of value\" for another, and this was in 2013/2014.\n\nI also got into Bitcoin because I like learning new tech. Im the dude that gets a 3d printer before they get popular, fund niche kickstarters etc. Bitcoin piqued my interest the same way. I also have bought a lot of things with Bitcoin to see what the experience is. Now for the unpopular statement:\n\nBitcoin for me has only been a novelty payment option. I've been swindled before, and if I'd used a credit card it would be sorted. TAP is way faster than anything I've bought with a live payment in the world. Last time I did that the person wanted me to stick around until a confirmation went through (2014). Just made the whole interaction weird. Purse.io was fun, but not user friendly enough for me to expect my mother to give it a go. I've lost coins on an exchange going down. Hasnt happened with my bank...\n\nSo to answer will it ever be used as a currency? Well the whole time up until the mem pool filled up it wasn't a very popular payment choice. I've used BTC a lot online and a few times in person... It's pretty rough around the edges tech right now. Lightning is the only thing I'm interested in for that at the moment. Sure BCH/LTC/etc isn't backed up like BTC's mempool, but its still the same old novelty payment platform. The instant micro article test payments I've been playing with on LN though... I see this as a potential for another revolution. I miss the tip bots, lightning would improve on those. I want to one-click tip a Youtuber, a news article, a Reddit comment. I want to tip people that make memes. We're not there yet, but we could be if LN works. If not, well that's sad and we're left with the same bloating blockchain, 10 minute confirms, and rough around the edges tech we had before the block side drama came to a head.",

The fee in your transaction is much lower than this at 240 sat/byte, so your transaction is gonna be low priority until some of the higher-paying transactions are mined.

Then it bounced back, and went higher. I was forced to ride the dip, and now I know the power of the HODL.\nDon\u2019t be reckless, but Bitcoin has came back with a vengeance after every major dip and crash in the past.",

I would have sold, I know it...to avoid losing my gains. Most people who made big bucks were people who forgot they had it, or a few who truly believed in the tech die hard. ",

Making the decision to dump a ton of money into the currency back then would've been an insane idea. Yes it would've paid out but it still would've been a bad idea with the knowledge you had at the time.\n\nYea it would've been nice to at least have 5 coins or something but you probably would've sold them earlier because you had no idea it would keep going up.\n\nThere is just too much uncertainty to beat yourself up for not buying in. You made a fair decision with the knowledge you had at the time.",

There's also electrum (a software program). I think those all communicate with central nodes but they protect and put you in control of the private keys.\n\nAlso convenient are phone wallets like coinomi or mycellium, and you do control the private keys on those as well but I would advise against storing any large amount on them as I don't trust phones that much. I have used them both with no problems though.\n\n\nOne caveat to consider - you are in total control of your bitcoin with one of those wallets, but currently, in times like where lots of people want to move around lots of bitcoin, you risk paying a high fee to move it from wallet<->exchange",

            "Text": "> the current situation needs economies to keep inflating and expanding to survive. Which is why people say they're like a giant ponzi scheme. \n\nI find it incredibly ironic that people who support Bitcoin call nation's economies a Ponzi scheme. Its not necessarily a bad thing for a country to have debt if its sustainable with its future growth. Bitcoin, on the other hand, currently has no value more than it is speculative (people hold it because they believe more people will hold it in the future).\n\n> We need to keep consuming to keep this bubble intact. Can our planet survive ever expanding consumption?\n\nYou are confusing two things. Just because we consume more does not mean that we are extracting more natural resources. In fact, most growth in advanced economies comes from intangible factors. \n\nImagine a country that consumes 50 breads and 50 digital books. If consumption doubled because people now consume 150 books, is the planet less sustainable?",

            "Text": "An expanding population (and the hope of greater prosperity) does require economies to keep inflating. Otherwise people get poorer. \n\nYou seem to conflate two core things: 1- increased economic activity and 2- increased planetary consumption. While both are strongly related, they are not identical. For example, American energy use peaked in the early 2000's, while our population has expanded by 40 million and our economy has become ever more tech/energy consuming thing focused. Simply put, things got a lot more efficient. \n\nThe matter of debt is mostly to use soft inflation (2-3%) to gradually make it easier for the government to borrow money (and thus fund things like Medicare/Medicaid or other useful programs) while encouraging people to spend money or turn it into assets instead of keeping liquid currency in the bank.\n\nThe core problem with how people approach currency is that it is inherently valueless. The whole point of money is to be a method of easily carrying value with you. For example, you sell your house and use the value to buy another house. Money is the tool that allows you to do so without having to do a direct trade of houses between you and the seller, or having to make the inefficient step of converting that money into things the seller wants (and also making sure your buying price for those things is as close as possible to the seller's desired buying price). \n\nWhich leads to my biggest frustration with Bitcoin evangelists: they want Bitcoin to be a currency, but everything that they love and value about Bitcoin treats it actually like an asset. There is a reason why we moved away from currency as an asset (backed by gold) to currency as a tool, it just doesn't make sense in the modern economy where people are invariably unable to make the products they require themselves.",

Bitcoin Core is the odd man out here. If SegWit2x could've fixed the problem, I don't know why it was rejected out of hand. I doubt a modest block bump would've been difficult to implement easily either or require years of robust testing.",

Then when it hits 20k we cant fulfill that sell order so the price drops to like 19,800. \n\nAt which point they move some of that or place another sell wall of 2-6 million at 19,800 which slides the price to 19,500.  Then they take half of their 20 million sell wall at put 10 million at 19,500.\n\nWhich dips us even further.\n\nNormally we would organically eat through these sell walls. But you will notice that as we try to they top up and stack more on the wall. Then when the price falls they move the wall to a lower price point.\n\nTheir reasoning.  Maybe they are pumping an altcoin, maybe they put a short on bitcoin, maybe they are keeping the price lower longer while they buy more through arbitrage.  Idk. All i know is they are maliciously manipulating and fucking with peoples money and it aint right.\n\nI would say its been roger doing it for over a week in preparation for his bcash pump at the difficulty adjustment.

I had a mere 1.5 back in 2013. had mined litecoin on the way up and traded them for btc shortly before it crashed back to $300. lost faith and then frittered the coin away.\nI'm here now hustling my way back to 0.1btc. No big deal. still 'missed the boat' this time round. Got my hands on a pair of GTX1060's in may. It crossed my mind to get them mining something but I wanted to play cities skylines over the summer so I took a raincheck. I'd be quids in now. oh well leasson double learned...

            "Text": "Firstly congrats on poking your nose for ~~advice~~/~~guidance~~ my insight.\n\nBefore I go any further, you will & have to in time adopt and understand the speculative nature of these crypto markets. \n\nFor starters, **every Altcoin is measure in BTC & not USD.**\n\nLet me give you an e.g. of a Bitcoin Dilema: You have $2000 worth of Fiat on an exchange. *BTC* is $20k & an ALT called *XYZ* is 0.01 BTC aka $200.\n\nLets say you brought $1000 worth of BTC and receive 0.05 BTC (excluding trading fees). With the other $1000 you got 5 XYZ with is also worth 0.05 BTC.\n\nNow let's say XYZ is valued at 0.04 BTC @ $240.\n\nYou lost 20% BTC and gain 20% Fiat. Did you lose or make money? You pretty much lose 20% of your Bitcoin. So why did you gain 20% Fiat?\n\nI'll leave this here for you to analyse but don't hesitate to ask me if your stuck.\n\nAltcoin developers may like it or not ( be it a legit or scammy protect) but real crypto trader will never hodl an alt beyond its overvalued price in BTC. The people who bag hodl and lose those juicy BTC profits are the one who are fixated on an ever deprecating Fiat (USD) value. \n\nSo what happen when BTC drops 10% and other Alt are up 10 to 20% in BTC value? Its  simple. \n\nBTC had a crazy bull run forcing every Alt trader to hodl bags at -20%, -35%, -45%.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because markets appear irrational. Since no alts ever die, a BTC dagger at -70% will still somehow find support.  This is the start of a pump and dump ride.\n\nHere is where an honest soul says (with TA) I'll try to grown my 0.05 BTC to 0.06 BTC\n\nI hope you can get the correlation between a bullish bitcoin, altcoin and fiat.\n\nThe illusion of alts will disappear if Bitcoin turly BEAR for X period of time. Altcoin will/can  drop 40% to 50% (this is the biggest risk of any top and every top tier coin) in a day. This is because money us temp pounding out of CRYPTO to sit in cash (fiat) so they can 1.15X, 1.25X, 1.33X their Bitcoin Hodlings.\n\nThe macro fundamentals of Bitcoin will keep this game running while the micro fundamentals of Altcoins will hint towards pumps and dumps. \n\n**Coming back to your situation**\n\noption a) is is being reckless and so is option b).\n\nReflect back for a second and think the roulette options of red and black you put forward. I won't go into those details unless you can't find the answer to it.\n\nHere is my recommendation which you should question and adopt for your own.\n \n1) Buy BTC periodically on a weekly basis.\n\n2) Never go all in because fear and greed will take over and the result is ruins. Buy btc/alt high and sell low.\n\n3) Do you love Fiat or Bitcoin? My store of wealth is BTC so I can't sleep with a trade hanging in fiat. The same way you've got to fix your unit of account and decide which  base currency would you hodl your wealth in. P.S the long term answer is never Alt.\n\n4) Develop a mindset to always take yourvprofits in Bitcoin. You can so this with BTC or ALT.\n\n5) BTC preservation is the name of the game.\n\nTLDR: I would only buy Altcoins (w/ TA) to gain more BTC. \n\nI would never go all in and risk being broke on dip. \n\nTry to grasp these situations and understand how people make and lose BTC.\n\nYour goal should be to convert fiat (rationally) to BTC and preserve it. From there your skills will determine if you can gain or lose more BTC (not fiat).\n\nTry to start slow and grow from there. I'll always be here and never give up on you as long as you stay to true to the objectives of this space. Alternatively you can go you own way and play the 'FUD BTC and pump my bag' to gain more BTC but the venom will catch up sooner or later.\n\nIts better to play the honest game and not dump the naive while gaining skills on your own.\n\nI'll get into TA ( to gain more BTC) later on but for now understand the vast risk of touching the stove with Altcoins. If you irrationally buy Alts, traders like me will have no option but to cut you short and eat your BTC. Don't make these mistakes without a strong reasons to identify valid trendline breaks to the upside, sticking to stop losses and letting profits runs.\n\nP.S: I hadn't proof read this comments so do overlooks any typos. \n\nJust understand this macro view and I'll get back to you on your 2k (:",

            "Text": "If you are worried about what to buy, don't want to miss the boat, find you're trading emotionally etc. Diversify. In the stock market there are products called ExchangeTradedFunds. It's a lot like a mutual fund, but instead of having a manager, they just follow the market. I own $SPY for example - Follows the American S&P market. Short version is, don't go all in on one and try to beat the market. A lot of people in here think of buying a coin as a zero-sum game. IE: If someone new comes in and buys BCH instead of BTC, the BTC holder loses. \n\nSo buy both. If the market goes up, so do you.\n\nSO how to balance? Taking the top coins on the market you can balance like I have below. If you don't like a coin, buy less or skip it entirely. If you have a good feeling on one, add more to your position. As the market shifts every couple months, re-balance. The only way to lose is if the whole market loses. Im not a professional but I've done well in the market as a passive investor in equities. I've beat the (equities) market by a bit using a similar strategy as a foundation. The most important thing is the markets don't keep me awake at night; This strategy takes the panic out of it. Today I saw Bitcoin drop and BCH climb, and I'm not far off of where I started this morning. Considering I'm heavily weighted in BTC, I'm pretty sure I've come out a little less scratched than most.\n\nFeel free to throw my advice in the trash, but if you're finding yourself stressing out checking prices ever 10 minutes, this is a good step to alleviating that stress. And the more tolerance you have for risk, the more you can deviate from the plan.\n\n(These numbers are old, from this morning) \n\n60% BTC\n\n16% ETH\n\n9% BCH\n\n9% Ripple\n\n6% LTC\n\n6% IOTA\n",

I use the LTC/BTC exchange on GDAX and use limit orders. I wait until there is a lot of volume which causes really fast price movements. Say I set a buy LTC limit order at 0.01650 and purchase 20 LTC. Immediately after it fills, I pick a spot of where I think it will rise to and set my sell order, lets say at 0.0170. When there is a lot of volume, this could only take seconds. If it fills, I make a profit of 0.0005 BTC per LTC. So at 20 LTC, that's a total profit of 0.01 BTC (~$180). I like to do very quick trades like this, as I like to get my money back into BTC as quickly as possible.",

There are real problems with BTC right now with high transaction fees, however Roger Ver (BCH advocate he controls) is not the person to solve these problems.

Yet when the banks came close to collapsing, most of them were not allowed to fail and tax payers money was used to prop them up.\n\nPrinting money combined with low interest rates also has the added side effect of making people with property or assets richer whilst those without are left behind. So its pretty similar to Bitcoin - those who own some will benefit most, the earlier they buy in. Those who come in last will benefit least or be left behind.",

Cons: Obviously tx time and cost. \n\nETH - Pros: Tech seems to have the best combo of use cases and adaption; community seems stable; and I think the cryptokitties are actually good publicity, rather than a nuance \n\nXRP - Pros: Again, cool technology, cool use cases; likely  to get more use cases in the future; good marketing. Cons: Not sure how Ripple as a technology affects xrp as a currency. I see a very real possibility that the tech company succeeds without the coin rising in value, in which case I've wasted my time and money. This sorta applies to ETH too, to a lesser degree.",

Just type the address in, double check, triple check, and keep checking until you're 100% sure.  Another less obsessive approach would be to send a test transaction of only a small amount, and once that clears do an additional transaction for the amount you really want to send. HOWEVER, due to the current high tx fees and delays in the mempool, that could cost you a week or so of waiting.",

So if you want to buy altcoins for $150 you are gambling on the fact that said altcoin will jump up in its own market price for a given time period higher (in terms of percentage) then Bitcoin jumps up in that same time period. If nothing changes, then you still have your $150 worth of altcoin which is relative in price to Bitcoin.. Think of it like buying Bitcoin using US dollars or Australian dollars. The Bitcoin market price is still the same, but the buying power of your currency is different.",

            "Text": "So now I finally had some time to go through your answer and to give it some thought. I will try to go through everything although I think I have some problems understanding certain aspects. \n\n\n> You lost 20% BTC and gain 20% Fiat. Did you lose or make money? You pretty much lose 20% of your Bitcoin. So why did you gain 20% Fiat? I'll leave this here for you to analyse but don't hesitate to ask me if your stuck.\n\n\nTo be honest, I\u00b4m having trouble understanding this. I get that altcoins are being measured in BTC and that if I\u00b4m investing in altcoins in the end I\u00b4m also investing in BTC. \nI also understand the scenario you displayed to the point where my Altcoin is losing value but my Fiat is going up. If I understand you correctly then the reason for that is BTC being \"in the lead\" here and that altcoins are depending on the value of BTC and not Fiat. So even when an Altcoin is losing value, it does not necessarily mean that BTC is going down. Is this correct? \n\nCould you also explain to me what you mean by: \n\n\n>real crypto trader will never hodl an alt beyond its overvalued price in BTC. The people who bag hodl and lose those juicy BTC profits are the one who are fixated on an ever deprecating Fiat (USD) value. \n\n\nHow do you know if a price for a alt is overvalued or not? I read a lot at the moment and all I keep hearing is how much potential other alts like Monero or IOTA have. Is this all a bullshit? And if so, why? \n\n\n>I hope you can get the correlation between a bullish bitcoin, altcoin and fiat.\n\n\nI think I understand the basic modell here. Do you have maybe a link to a good site where I can read more on this? Or is there maybe a good YouTube video which you would recommend me to watch? \n\n\n>Here is my recommendation which you should question and adopt for your own. 1) Buy BTC periodically on a weekly basis.\n\n\nI understand now that my plan was ineed not the smartest idea. What I don\u00b4t get is why I should buy periodicly. I have the feeling that the longer I wait the more the value of BTC increases. Shouldn\u00b4t it be my goal to try to aquire BTC at the lowest price possible? I mean I understand that the value is constantly changing and that there is no proof whatsoever that the bullish period will continue like it did but the chances are quite good, aren\u00b4t they? \n\n\n>2) Never go all in because fear and greed will take over and the result is ruins. Buy btc/alt high and sell low.\n\n\nI have the feeling that this is probably the most important advice from you. But I\u00b4m having struggles understanding the second part of it. Usually all you hear is buy low and sell high. I googles a little bit and read a couple of definitions for the buy high/sell low approach but I don\u00b4t really get it. Could you give me some more insights on this strategy? \n\n\n>3) Do you love Fiat or Bitcoin? My store of wealth is BTC so I can't sleep with a trade hanging in fiat. The same way you've got to fix your unit of account and decide which base currency would you hodl your wealth in. P.S the long term answer is never Alt.\n\n\nI see the potencial of Crypto and strongly believe in it. But I also see a lot of unpredictability when it comes to it. In my case I have the feeling that even if I would make the descision to shift to BTC as my prime currency, I would not be able to live that way. All of my surroundings is still in the Fiat world and I don\u00b4t see that changing in the next 3-5 years. Germany in particular is quite slow when it comes to the adaptation of new technology. We still struggle to accept debit/credit cards in smaller stores for example and we are still light years away from a digital payment system like Apple pay. So to answer your question: I would gladly make the transition from Fiat to BTC but I think this is a process that needs to be done very slowly.\n\n\n> It's better to play the honest game and not dump the naive while gaining skills on your own.\n\n\nI understand this and I\u00b4m not trying to get rich overnight. I know this will not work and the risk to loose it all is too high. I\u00b4m 29 and for the first time in my life, I\u00b4m in the position (thanks to a new job) to have a steady amount of disposable income coming in each year. I want to be smart about this decision and make the right moves. The 2k I will get is hopefully just the start but I want to make the best out of it and built a foundation for myself. \n\nsooooo I think I have touched every subject of your answer that I had trouble understanding. Sorry for this wall of text :) I\u00b4m really looking forward for your answers to it. Thx once again. \n\n",

I do have faith that btc will only continue to grow. However if my trade turns out to be a bad one, I won't fret. \n\nThanks! ",

Technically, your bitcoin is currently sitting in a GDAX \"wallet.\" The goal should be to move your coins off an online exchange to something offline, like a desktop wallet. This reduces the likelihood that a hacker will get your coins, and if the exchange were to suddenly shut down or undergo maintenance, you would still have access to your bitcoin. \n\n~~There will be a small fee to transfer the coin to the wallet~~ GDAX should be able to cover the network fees when transferring to a wallet.\n\nYour bitcoin will not stop fluctuating - you're just moving it from one wallet to another. You're simply changing it's location.\n\nWhat I personally do is move all my coins to desktop or hard drive wallets, and then track my portfolio using a phone application, like Blockchain or Delta. These types of apps just let you input the amount you own; you don't need to move the coin to the actual app. This way, you know your coins are safe in your wallet(s), but you can still track your gains/losses without having to worry about your coins sitting in an exchange.",

            "Text": ">>So even when an Altcoin is losing value, it does not necessarily mean that BTC is going down. Is this correct? \n\nYes. Say if an ATH of an ALT *ABC* is 0.01 BTC & its fiat high is $200 (they can be two different price points).\n\nA fib retracement of those numbers are 0.00618, 0.005, 0.00382 & 0.00236 BTC respectively. On the fiat side its $123.6 $100, $76.4 & $47.2.\n\nThe rate at which the USD value is violated to the upside is more often or not faster than the rate of BTC. Try it out with some Altcoins and you'll notice this correlation. \n\nSo you can follow, buy & hodl or trade any altcoin but don't forget to measure their unit of account in Bitcoin. If your losing BTC after purchasing an ALT it means that you've lost money.\n\n>>How do you know if a price for a alt is overvalued or not? \n\nThats subjective but T.A should make you better at buying and selling altcoins. Each chartist have their own style and I rely primarily on support & resistance. \n\n*Tip: By the laws of probability the risk of losing Bitcoin is greater when you buy an ALT at the higher fib retracement from its ATH (BTC value).*\n\nSome Alts have an legitimate user case while most have a good story. If there is no direct use case for you then you only trade time and price. This makes it easier to identify entries and take profits when needed.\n\n>>Or is there maybe a good YouTube video which you would recommend me to watch? \n\nCan't recollect any specific video but here are a few channels I can vouch for.\n\n* aantonop\n* Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast\n* Bitcoin TV\n* Off Chain with Jimmy Song\n* World Crypto Network\n\nFor Bitcoin Resources: www.lopp.net/bitcoin.html\n\n>>What I don\u00b4t get is why I should buy periodicly. I have the feeling that the longer I wait the more the value of BTC increases. Shouldn\u00b4t it be my goal to try to aquire BTC at the lowest price possible?\n\nBasically you will play the role of an investor, trader or both. \n\nAs an investor you should measure the total USD spent and BTC received.  If you divide the total USD spent/BTC received you'll get your price per bitcoin (PPB) value. \n\nBy investing periodically you are finding ways to quantify the unknown. If you put all your money in at the top in 2013 you wouldn't in a position to keep buying the dip and increasing your hodling (% of coins from 21 million). At the same time if you went all in at the dip ~$150 to $200, you would be on an island right now. Periodic investing will keep us in check from our emotions of fear and greed. There something known as Value  Cost Investing (VCA) or mBitcoin Cost Averaging (mBCA) which I use to stick to. mBCA is where you buy a fixed (or more at the dip) mBTC value periodically ireespective of its fiat value. You can readjust that value if needed when Bitcoin doubles.\n\nAs a trader, its all about entries, stops and taking profits. Time and price (not the stock or currency) is everything.\n\n>> 2) Never go all in because fear and greed will take over and the result is ruins Buy btc/alt high and sell low.\n\nOopsy daisy!!! I forget to make my pun obvious. Buying high and selling low is a direct result of fear and greed.\n\n>>3) Do you love Fiat or Bitcoin? My store of wealth is BTC so I can't sleep with a trade hanging in fiat.\n\nI was referring to the 'total USD spent' to buy  BTC & ALTS and not ones absolute net worth. \n\nNever put more than 10% (15% at tops) of your family's net worth in crypto especially all at once. Your goal is for that fraction to challenge you total net worth in time. By this Risk:Reward ratio you stand you double you net worth in time or lose a tenth of it.\n\n>> I'm 29 and for the first time in my life, I'm in the position (thanks to a new job) have a steady amount of disposable income coming in each year.\n\nCongrats on the new job and may it take your career to new heights. \n\nLets say you have \u20ac2k to invest every month, thats \u20ac500/week.\n\n54 weeks x 500 = \u20ac27,000. Using DCA, VCA or mBCA try to buy & hodl or buy, trade & hodl coins that would eventually see its way on a hardware wallet.\n\nIn 4 years time if things go as planned you would have **saved up** \u20ac108,000 which has the potential to **be valued at** \u20ac500,000 or more.

But, imagine all of a sudden EVERYONE and their mom buys some small ALT because they have invented some revolutionary technology (or whatever), BTC can still be the same price (because it wasn't necessarily dumped) and said ALT will jump up in price (due to demand) by orders of magnitude. Now you have BTC and the ALT soaring in value as more overall money is being pumped into the crypto market.",

Before you even know it you\u2019re engulfed in a world of doubt and insecurity about your investment. Then while it\u2019s down 20% it flashes down another 10% and you think OMFG IM FUCKED and you come 2 clicks away from panic selling your whole stack. Well before you can even get the sell off, the price recovered half of the crash, and it\u2019s hovering down 15%. At this point. You think maybe I should cut my losses and sell. Now you are whale food. Because in a week, the price will have completely recovered and gone to a new all time high. \n\nYou cannot time the market at all. Just like last nights intense dip, nobody saw it coming. Now if you want to assume anything is going to happen, the opposite will probably happen.",

            "Text": "I agree, but (if it happens), this transition should have been gradual. What happened here seems to be a mix of leaked insider knowledge by Coinbase (Coinbase CEO saying that they are going to conduct an internal investigation because they are also suspicious that the price rose before the announcements) and a coordinated effort by Chinese miners Bitmain and Antpool to delegitimize Bitcoin and convert Bitcoin miners to BCH miners. Coinbase really fumbled here with underestimating the power that they have gotten in recent months and they need to start acting like a US stock exchange that has the SEC breathing down their neck at every move. I'm fearing the the SEC could get involved here and it would be VERY bad press for cryptocurrencies in the USA. \n\nOn the mining note, the fact that the last BTC drop and BCH rise in Nov. also coordinated with a change in BTC difficulty shows that there is either too much power in the hands of major ASIC miners like Bitmain or that there is a vital flaw being exposed for POW cryptocurrencies where discrepancies will inevitably develop between mining profits and market value causing miners to jump ship on a coin very suddenly. In light of current events I fear that it's the major ASIC factories moving their weight around for political reasons (and ultimately financial as a result of the politics) that are beginning to cause a problem. \n\nAnyways, my main argument is that today's events didn't come from a coordinated awakening of the masses to the benefits of BCH, but from the poor (and possibly coordinated) actions of some of crypto's elites. The Coinbase thing stinks of an SEC investigation, particularly because the CEO himself admitted that the price rise of BCH pre-market price rise smelled of an insider leak. And what if that leak made it all the way to Jihan and friends?\n\n(For the record I made some good money on BTC but I don't currently hold. I was just worried in Nov about the flippening and I'm VERY worried now that Coinbase is caught up in it.)",

            "Text": "So basically your private key is just a random number chosen from an enormously huge domain.  As long as you generate that number randomly, only you can spend whatever coin you have.  You download your wallet software, generate the key, which you do not show ANYONE.  Then you use that to generate a public key and a public address.  You share the public address as your \"send-to\" address for your coins (whatever they may be).\n\nBitcoin has a very long history and there are many OPEN SOURCE wallets out with very long histories,and you can review the source code for yourself. Many other coins do not have open source wallets. When the wallet runs, you have no idea what the program just did exactly (unless you are very proficient with computers). It might have just chosen a predetermined seed so someone else could steal from you.  It might have just inserted a sleeper virus to ransomware your computer 6 months from now. You have no idea. It is not open source. You just downloaded a random software and gave it free reign on your HD, GPU and CPU. \n",

I assume they, and the miners, are loving the current fees they're getting and don't have a motivation to change anything?

A lot of ALTs have tiny development teams who hardly do much from week to week to improve their technology. Anyone buying ALTs (excluding Etherium and possibly Litecoin) is just gambling on the price going up. Think of the price movement on ALTs like this: I buy a bunch of ALT, someone sees this and buys even more of said ALT, all of a sudden others start noticing and thinking to themselves that price is about to sky rocket and start jumping on the bandwagon and driving the price up.  Then, I sell my bunch of ALTs and people noticed that, so the mass hysteria begins again and people start selling and tanking the price..  Its all crowd mentality, speculation, gambling with a pinch of manipulation thrown in.",

            "Text": "That is correct. It gets complicated due to the multiple variables involved. Many people \"lose\" money because they are in Alts when BTC makes a run. The Alts tend to be stagnant or drop when BTC moves up significantly. So, relative to BTC you've lost value even though you may have gained value in $ terms in the Alts. It's an opportunity cost. You have to decide whether you're trying to maximize your $$ or your BTC. Most of the Alt traders are trying to maximize BTC and only look at the relative value between BTC and the ALT. General rule is that if BTC is moving sideways get into alts. If BTC starts making a run up get out of alts and into BTC. Usually when BTC drops the alts will drop as well due to some sort of overall crypto FUD or something (but not always). Of course it all sounds obvious but doing it in practice is pretty difficult.",

            "Text": "> Say the transaction doesn't go through, who then gets my coins? \n\nI would imagine litebit.eu would put the coins back in your account and you could just try again, but I'm not sure because I've never heard of litebit.eu before and I don't know how they handle failed transactions. You'd have to ask them by contacting their customer support. Remember, they're not bitcoin, they're a company that deals with bitcoin, so no one knows how they act except them, and their complications don't really represent Bitcoin as a whole...\n\n> I imagined this to go a lot smoother hahahaha\n\nIt used to, but the current form of Bitcoin was not in any way prepared for the rush of people that comes from the media talking about it as if it's a get-rich-quick guarantee. If you [look at the mempool over the last three months](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#3m) it has become increasingly clogged and the fee system has gotten more and more complex and expensive.\n\nBitcoin plays it safe with changes, and therefore it sometimes has to move slow, which means that big changes like all of the attention it got recently can sometimes cause problems. My argument for a 2x blocksize is a simple change that has been considered for years, so I feel like now is the time to add it and fix this problem, especially considering that if we want mainstream adoption, we're going to need it eventually anyway.",

No asset appreciates that much in so little time and no currency does either unless the currency it is pegged against is going through hyperinflation.  I've seen some people argue on this sub that fiat is indeed doing this - but they can't explain why gold isn't skyrocketing as well.\n\nI have an answer - it's the fucking USDT.  Over the course of the past year over a billion dollars worth of tethers have been used to purchase Bitcoin. \n\nThose tethers are not backed by USD, in fact, they probably aren't backed by anything.",

But it's dangerous precedent to just equate bitcoin to casino gambling, the mainstream news who call it that is being completely irresponsible and idiotic when there are a lot of people who have invested their money in it. That kinda of FUD campaign is going to make people lose a lot of their money.\n\nI'd be okay with a more reasonable explanation of what bitcoin is, and it's potential, it's cons right now. But simply just call it casino gambling just disregards the whole complexity of what bitcoin really is, and it's downright bullshit. That's your typical sensationalist headline to grab people to read into fake news.\n\nTo call it casino style gambling is the reason why people get fleeced. A warning about investing in bitcoin is sufficient, but to spread ill informed FUD is dangerous.\n\nAnd I totally agree with you on tether, it's so damn sketchy, I'd much rather the news focus on something like that which is a real concern. But to just call it casino style gambling sounds like a smear campaign. Lots of misinformation is being spread around.\n\nAnd the BCH side of this is using it to their advantage, look at what happened just now. Tons of people just lost lots of money because of this FUD campaign, and BCH is being fueled by it. I don't disagree that it's gambling for most people, but I take issue with smear campaigns, and not actual news and information about bitcoin - also what potential solutions there are? and what we can do about it in the future? because the idea behind it is revolutionary, it's just not executed correctly.",
