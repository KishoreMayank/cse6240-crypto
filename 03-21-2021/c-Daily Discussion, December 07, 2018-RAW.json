There\u2019s always a pretty diverse crowd . I\u2019d like to say I\u2019ve been savvy in all the transactions I\u2019ve made involving it , but can any one say that with 100% certainty ? I\u2019ve bought at bad times every time considering it\u2019s at its lowest since I started . I\u2019ve been lucky ( I think ) as of late because somehow I HAVE managed to successfully short it at the right times . It gives me a little anxiety every time, sure , but I\u2019ve also followed the advice on not putting in more than I can afford to lose . The thing that keeps me going is the fact that see other posts here about bitcoin ATM\u2019s and businesses still using it in a lot of places . I think the idea of crypto-currency in general is the future ... and I think that it will eventually gain value again . I\u2019m definitely in it for what a lot of you think is the wrong reasons ( to make money ) but if you\u2019re honestly in it just because you believe in the tech , wouldnt your money be just as well spent on other charities ? I guess I\u2019m a hodler , but for the wrong reasons ... cause I\u2019ll still be buying in when ever my stupid brain says \u201c eh , ok ... this might be the lowest ... better grab a little more before the moon! \u201c either way ... guess I\u2019m just trying to say ... thanks folks. Cause beyond the bs and back and forth between who\u2019s making the right choices with their money, we\u2019re all here for the same reason . Interest in driving lambos ... that and some of you mother fuckers are pretty informative at times .",

That's assuming you fucked up and bought at $20k lol. \n\nAt this point, taking another 18% hit and watching BTC self destruct all the way to 0 would be a walk in the park compared to selling and praying it doesnt come back up. So good luck fear mongering anybody who made it this far into selling lol.",

But I'd also guess the bottom will be far lower and longer than most expect. 1000? 500? 100? 23? Who knows. Bitcoin and blockchain are worthless and have probably wasted a more of earth's resources (coal, NG, etc) than anything in history.\n\nIt's a ponzi. Play it like one. \n\nFyi, I bought last fall, and sold most in the run up. And the rest early in the crash.

Especially if, given that USD and the banking industry, are tied hand in hand, that any 'threat' to banks is also a 'threat' to national security. Everyone talks about taking control away from governments, and that is treasonous. So, if banks don't want bitcoin, they will use everything in their power to short it out of existence. \n\nThe house always wins. Always. Their guns are bigger and they own the printing presses that can print the fiat that buys the bitcoin.",

Bitcoin market is NOT the same as the stock market. Neither is FX for example. There are very fundamental differences that should be considered by anyone trading the markets.\n\nMicrostructures are different for different markets but things like stop cascades (which most people trading bitcoin probably don't understand at all but which are highly relevant) can clearly be seen from the price changes.\n\nHelp yourself and read this: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr150.html\n\nIf the trend is down (or even neutral) you are not buying dips. Buying dips is relevant when there is either short or long term positive trend. With stock indices buying dips is almost always a good idea even if there is pain at the short term as western economic system requires economic growth. So if the stock market wouldn't recover in long term, that would mean that the whole economic system would fall. And at that point there are much larger things to consider like large scale riots and so on than your stock portfolio.\n\nSomething to consider: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fallingknife.asp\n\nHope this helps someone save their money.\n",

            "Text": "Bitcoin has a self preservation mechanism whereby it monitors the amount of blocks mined over time (Ithink it's 2 weeks) and adjusts it's algorithm accordingly. You can research it further but basically it compensates for the addition and subtraction of miners and their equipment. So in the very worst case scenario it would drop back to being able to be mined on a PC (highly unlikely), in which case I know I would go back to mining and so would millions of others. Then the entire cycle would play out again. Either way, Bitcoin is not going anywhere, don't you worry.",

I\u2019m pessimistic short term due to market trend, but very optimistic mid term (beyond 3 years). And partly optimistic long term (>10 years).  Right now it is more of a speculative asset with enormous growth potential as opposed to a currency.  It has a solid track record over the last 9 years of early stage logarithmic growth. It has crashed several times by ~90% and always comes back higher after the bear markets ends. It might take a couple more years, but this time will be no different ",

The posts are usually talking down to a user who has money invested, and with little intention other than to insult them and criticize their person decision to do what they choose with their own money. So my guess would be that 'no coiner' is used to basically tell those people to mind their own business, since they are not even invested and have no stance to pass judgment.",

Pretty much no one gives a shit and absolutely no one I've ever talked to actually uses bitcoin to purchase things. Look at the volume being traded. Nothing pointed towards bitcoin being worth 200 billion. On top of that there were articles showing that bitcoin had been manipulated to get as high as it did. The market was artificially changed so the price literally could not have been \"correct\". At the end of the day we are talking about what is an online gimmick used to almost exclusively buy illegal goods. And while the idea of cryptocurrencies is intriguing, there really isn't much about bitcoin that leads me to believe it will be the king long term.

Not to mention that McDonald's wasn't the first fast food chain, it was the one that learned from the others (Bob's Big Boy is where the idea for the Big Mac was taken from), and was able to take off from there completely crushing the early entrants that \"innovated\" the industry.\n\nGiven switching costs for miners is relatively low, and the fact that bitcoin after nearly a decade mired in technical bureaucracy has barely evolved, it would make sense that a cheaper, but technically superior coin will come out on top.  That is if a mainstream use case is even found.",

The problem with bitcoin is that it's technically poor, after a decade of \"growth\" it pretty much still has the same issues that have been plaguing it for years, slow confirm times, economic incentives to create nodes, etc.  Progress is being made, but at an iceberg's pace.  \n\nWith switching costs low, if a real mainstream use case were to appear, the technically superior coin has a much better chance to win out.  I mean look at bitcoin's only real use case today, buying drugs on the darknet, in this case it's already been usurped by monero, which offers superior privacy.  Network effects were not enough to overcome its technological disadvantage.",

Maybe more, five figures six figures I don't know the depth of your exposure.\n\nThat's an extreme gamble\n\n>acquire enough bitcoin to make a fortune later.\n\nThe reason you can't see anything clearly is because your eyes are full of dollar signs.   You are losing so much money every minute every hour every day but for some reason you think this is a route to make yourself rich\n\nYou have tunnel vision sir.  You may make some people rich but it wont be yourself.  It's the people who have convinced you to buy their bitcoins at 6k 5k 4k 3k.  They are straight up taking your money and you will not get it back.",
