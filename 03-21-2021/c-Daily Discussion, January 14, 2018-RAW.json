For the first time in human history, we have the advancement of something being an easy cheap currency and store of value. Until the currency portion is scaled properly, bitcoin\u2019s full potential is not realized. \nGold coins used to be that until they were over mined (we could find massive gold deposit in the deepest part of the ocean tomorrow increasing supply and reducing price) and than used as a store of wealth. Gold was rare and heavy (hard to steal) which is why they decided thousands of years ago to use it as currency. \nBitcoin uses MATH and laws of the universe with precise calculations. It is not fully mined till 2140 so if we can get this payment solution solved finally, we will be set for hundreds of years just as when gold was readily Mineable. \n\nIf bitcoin cannot solve this scaling problem soon where everyone can use it to buy things cheaply (commerce) than Governments will have an easier time banning it like in South Korea and China now. If the payment side of bitcoin was fixed and everyone could use it, no one would allow their governments to ban the way they pay for milk and eggs. ",

The price was at a point where average joe investor could plan an investment path of about $300 a month and in less than a year, own a hole coin, but of course that would rely on a steady price and the price of bitcoin is about as steady as Michael j. Fox's fork. In any case, they could own a good percentage of a coin in a short amount of time. Now with an average price of about $14,000, average Joe's $300 investment plan won't bring in as big a return for the relative risk there is. It would take almost 4 years to own a whole coin if the price doesn't budge.\n\n\nBut that's half the fun of crypto investing isn't it? The possibility of a huge runaway that nets huge gains. People can sit here and type out huge essays till they are blue in the face and their fingers are worn to the bones about how crypto is the future and the usd is dead but the average investor doesn't even care enough to  even glance over anything like that.  They just want to take that money they where suppose to use to buy their mom a birthday present \"invest\" it and reap the sweet returns.  \n\n\n\nLast years run was great. A lot of people made money last year and the word about crypto got some sunshine.  But as soon as bitcoin started to appear in articles with negative trigger words the timid sheep that hopped on the crypto ban wagon bailed out.  After the dust had settled, we are now left with the same group of early adopters, now owning more bitcoin and a few other new guys who believe in the crypto future holding the price steady.  Slowly buying more and more raising the value up at a more stable and sustainable rate until some random article comes out pointing out the sustained growth of crypto and if we are lucky, starting the cycle over again.  \n\n\n\nBut what the hell do I know, we might be on the moon after I finish this mornings shit....",

If you buy 60 BTC at 13400 and drive it up to around 14k (pretty easy, especially if you are syncing up with RSI and the BB bands), you make 40k in a few hours. \n\n\nWatch GDAX you see this all the time. You will commonly see a pattern where you will have a pretty big moving buy wall (e.g., 75 BTC), with a couple smaller walls spaced in front of it (20 BTC and 8 BTC). Then, the 8 BTC wall will hover near the market price, hoping that smaller investors eat through the resistance in the sell book. If the smaller investors don't fully eat through, the smaller wall will get pulled, and sellers will gobble up all of the small orders that have been placed behind the 8 BTC wall up to the 20 BTC wall. Then, the three walls will start driving upwards again to each point of major price resistance, letting other buyers do the work. Rinse and repeat until you hit your target (e.g, selling into the 14k buy wall).",

            "Text": "1) A sign of strength in the charts, or a fundamental reason (e.g. a good company at a low historical price). I'm typically a share trader. I look for a low price, and a lot of buying (high volume) in the background. I want the professionals to be buying, and the general public selling. This tends to happen after a long downtrend, followed by a big drop in price.\n\n2) This tends to be a stop loss, which then gives you a defined risk. If you're just holding, then your stop loss is zero, which means you're risking the entire amount you traded. No stop loss isn't always a bad strategy, as long as you're only risking small amounts of capital.\n\n3) For me, this would be either a strong resistance level, or when I start to see weakness in the chart. Any acceleration upwards, or huge amounts of volume coming in means I'm likely to look to take profit.\n\nI trade by trying to buy low, and sell high. With shares I've been pretty successful. I'm interested in Bitcoin at the moment because it's the first bubble I've witnessed live, and it's the biggest in history in % terms.\n\nOnce I saw \"massive Bitcoin price rises\" on the front page of The Times, I thought it was likely that the writing was on the wall for Bitcoin in the short and medium term. Why - because this is what draws the general public in, and when the professional traders dump their holdings.\n\n It may recover years from now. Of course, I may be wrong and it recovers a lot sooner.",

Ethereum took the idea of \"programmable money\" a step further and created a much richer scripting language, one that is (apparently) Turing complete; a real computer.\n\nRootStock is the same but uses Bitcoin instead of Ether, and aims to make an even \"richer\" language than Ethereum.\n\nDistributed Apps (dApps) are the main feature of such a platform; the code doesn't reside on a central server, nor in \"the cloud\", but across the Bitcoin network itself, just like bitcoin. They can't be controlled, nor stopped.\n\nWhether dApps are actually a useful direction is yet to be seen. The only dApp that is really running so far is CryptoKitties : \\\n\nEven though there is nothing of actual value made as a dApp yet, and I can't think of anything either, I still find the concept absolutely, honestly, mind-blowing (as a programmer); a distributed application.",

There won't be any buzz other than \"get rich quick\" with crypto just because of all the stories about how someone forgot they bought some years ago and now are buying lambs and what not. Yes, before you start, yes I know the lambo thing is just memes but the average buyer doesn't. Do you think they are going to stop and read a technical essay on how crypto works and invest smartly or dump their money into bitcoin through coinbase because they come up 1st in Google searches?  \n\n\nThe damage is already done and it will take a lot of work to undo it.  As it stands right now, crypto is not a currency but a commodity to be traded on in hopes of profiting on a short term investment.  If you want to point fingers at someone than just go through the posts people have made bragging about how much they have made in bitcoin.  Point at the news companies who post stories about \"man throws away millions of dollars in bitcoin\" because if you are truly in bed with bitcoin and its not just some quick cash cow than the only reason you should be interested in its price is to make sure it is stable and possibly showing small increases in value.  \n\nEdit: a word\n",

You'll see how big of a difference that makes as the market matures...\n\nIMO, over the next few years, I think LTC and other existing cryptocurrencies will lose out to gov-backed digital currencies for mainstream everyday spending. \n \nMeanwhile, the platforms (ie. Ethereum, possibly Neo, Eos, Lisk, etc.) will thrive, as increasing consumer usage of dApps will naturally drive demand for \"digital fuel\" up.  ",

            "Text": "And I am all for that. Honestly this to me sounds like the start of the \"credits\" system you hear about in future sci-fi movies and hell even in games.  But until that point is reached, there is a lot of damage done to the reputation of crypto. Not damage as in it is bad, but damage in that the majority of the market of people who are buying and selling crypto have not and will not even consider actually using it.  I am guilty of it myself, I get on board at 3k, missed 20k but sold at 15 and went back in at 13. I have no real intention of using it to buy anything and I am just going to keep my finger in the pot and see how it goes.\n\n\nFor this to really work and be viable, 1 bitcoin has to equal 1 bitcoin first, instead of XX thousand dollars.  It is like having a piece of string that you claim is the true unit of measurement because overall it works better. You can wrap it around things, twist it into places a meter stick won't fit but if someone asks how long is it and you have to pull out a meter stick to measure it are you really using it to measure.  Because if that board isn't said to be 1 1\\2 strings long but is called 3 meters long than you arent really using the string to measure.  Just to reference the standard of measerment. Crypto needs to come into its own value if it is to succeed like people claim it will.\n\nIts all fine and dandy to look towards and plan for the future but you still need to keep an eye out for where you are stepping so you dont fall into a hole. Right now there are a lot of people digging the hole for crypto whether they know it or not and not near enough people trying to fill it or at least build a bridge over it to help us see that future.\n\nI don't want crypto to fail but I also dont want to stand on a ship that could end up sinking itself. Because even though my name is Jack, I doubt I will find some hot chick to make naked stick figures of and to let me freeze to death because she doesn't know how to shift her damn weight...\n\n\nUpon rereading this, I have come to the conclusion that I use too many analogies.  So I am going to try to stay away from them like a fat guy avoids a salad.....damn it.",
