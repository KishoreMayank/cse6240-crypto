Your seed can't account for that.\n\nYou can restore your channels on another node if you move all the files over.\n\nI don't think having two running at the same time will work though because your node address includes your IP. The nodes you have channels with can only connect to one, not both nodes with different IPs.\n\nYour better bet would be to run an LND node and then use an app or web based host to interact with your node from multiple devices, but that is less secure.\n",

            "Text": "It has nothing to do with Internet Browsers. Those are applications, not protocols.\n\n3G, I'd say it's a better comparison. However it's different. By the way, 3G, and even HDSPA, uses the same old mobile GSM network, but with upgrades on top (soft forks, you could say, heh). Only with 4G companies had to upgrade the network to make it more internet-like.\n\nOf course that could happen to Bitcoin, but it's not like it'll just get swallowed by an altcoin that does something better overnight.\n\nAnd also, there's a big difference. Bitcoin is software. The hardware it runs on is basically irrelevant. That means it's much much easier to update and evolve than changing a ginormous amount of 3G antennas. Phone companies needed more speed, so the updated GSM until they reached a point where a hardware change was needed.\n\nThat's not exactly how Bitcoin works, but who knows.",
