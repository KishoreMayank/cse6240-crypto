Just realize that you cannot predict Bitcoin's price based on historical data or any type of technicals. Don't be fooled by previous bitcoin drops/pumps. Each time is new in its own way. We have never had such a massive drop dollar wise speaking, forget about percentages for a second. This is unchartered territory and no one really knows. I'm making a somewhat informed GUESS that it will go up, but in reality no one really knows, especially the people saying it will drop once it reaches x y or z.",

            "Text": "So I have a few questions about the sudden increase in bitcoin price on Feb 2. (See https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zig1-minzczsg2018-02-02zeg2018-02-02ztgMzm1g10zm2g25zxzvzcv).\nI was watching the chart, media and social media closely that day. Before 1 pm there was a general feel of despair with a lot of people selling in panic or having lost great sums already by gambling. The price was going down constantly. People were hoping for a wall at 8000 but that wall didn't come at all. Panic was ensuing even more.\nThen suddenly - boom. Within 10 Minutes the price skyrocketed. In the two ensuing hours around 150.000.000 dollars were pushed into the market (roughly 17.000-18.000 bitcoins).\nWhat did happen there? Classic well coordinated pump and dump (or just pump?) But why did the price staid stable after that? Some really big whales performing a perfectly buy and sell operation. But what for? If you invest such huge amounts of money you don't care about the project bitcoin - you want to make more money somehow and that was a huge gamble at that point if they didn't knew something we don't... Any ideas or explanations?",

Lots of indepth reliable info there with links to other companies to use at your own risk to take the plunge of buying. \n\nMany starter users like me find using an optional \"exchange\" (like Coinbase) to do most of the work for us for a modest fee is an easy way to start.\n\nIt's not government backed so if something bad happens can lose the money, so be very careful.",

While it certainly cuts into the business of payment processors when adopted, it isn't even competing for some of those needs.",

It can be tempting to imagine that there are these cunning, manipulative, shady characters that are scheming away together behind a locked door. In reality, most of the price movements can be explained through simple market forces. \n\nThe bounce that occurred yesterday happened because a crucial resistance level was met. The price fell back in level with the overall rising trend-line. The assumption from a lot of investors at that point is that it has reached the bottom. Therefore, a lot of buy pressure is suddenly triggered. We are currently stuck in limbo beneath another key resistance zone. If the price is able to break above then another sudden jump in price will occur. If it is not able to surpass that level, the price could just grind back down again.\n\nEveryone is looking at this the same way: through guesswork, which is an educated guess at best. This includes whales. The graph itself can be looked at as the sum of all guesses. The true price then reflects the guessed price. It is sort of like a self fulfilling prophecy. If more people guess the price will move up than down, then the price actually does move up. \n",

In 2008 that\u2019s a 10% drop while this was only 2.5%. Perspective is key. DOW is still up 3% in 2018. Like crpto, a healthy correction is key when you grow at such stupid rates.\n\nWith that said, btc needs to close Sunday\u2019s daily charts at or above 9600 to confidently say we are in a rebound.

The number that I remember Bitcoin being at before its massive run was like $3k. It started trippling and gaining percentage crazy at certain points in there. I would have to think what point was the most natural.\n\nI would also have to compare market cap by $k value. It's much easier to move from $6k-$12k in price because it requires a smaller amount of dollars. Let's say the market cap is at $50 billion at $6k. It will take another $50 billion dollars to get the price to $12k (double).  If the price has to double again from $12 to $24k then it will take $100 billion more dollars which would be harder to do.",

If the price has to double again from $12 to $24k then it will take $100 billion more dollars which would be harder to do.\n\nThat is not how that works, at all.  I am not sure anyone should consider your conclusions if you don't understand the basic MCAP concept.",

Why would anyone agree to accept this as a form of payment in its current state? It won't become anything more than it is currently, an investment, unless it stabilizes. And if it were to stabilize, maybe most of the current investors move on to something with high volatility again in an attempt to make money as opposed to storing value. If that were to happen, doesn't the value decrease and it once again becomes a volatile currency? Basically, unless government backed currencies cease to exist, why would the general people fully back these currencies? Unless people start getting paid in these currencies, I don't see how they will succeed. What I can see happening is a government moving on to their own crypto currency one day.",

Just realize that you cannot predict Bitcoin's price based on historical data or any type of technicals. Don't be fooled by previous bitcoin drops/pumps. Each time is new in its own way. We have never had such a massive drop dollar wise speaking, forget about percentages for a second. This is unchartered territory and no one really knows. I'm making a somewhat informed GUESS that it will go up, but in reality no one really knows, especially the people saying it will drop once it reaches X.",
