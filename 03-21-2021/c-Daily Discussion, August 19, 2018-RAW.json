You can provide them with knowledge of all the reasons why it is very likely that Bitcoin will be worth a great deal more than it is currently. You can provide specific facts and details regarding global developments... but you can't make them think.\n\nSome people want to remain stuck in a tiny perspective, and focus on bubble talk, tether conspiracies, and all the reasons why Bitcoin will fail. They prefer to criticize Bitcoin because the truth requires them to change their traditional view of currency and investing. That's very hard for some people so they attack, because that's easier.\n\nHere's the thing. People who are trolls often say \"hey man what's wrong with thinking Bitcoin will fail and thinking that investing in it is stupid?\" Well, nothing, but you're on a fucking Bitcoin reddit group!! \n\nDo you go to a cave diver's reddit group and call cave divers idiot's because it's risky? News flash: WE KNOW BITCOIN IS RISKY.  That's why we do this, we believe it's worth the potential reward and we believe in that potential.",

Trying to get myself to just look at things less and go about my life. Trading action has been much better in equities lately and it's really good in Forex if you are familiar with that market.\n\nCrypto is in a down cycle and unless we start going sideways soon the chance of a saucer bottom that drags out just like 2015 did starts becoming a lot more substantial\n\nIf this cycle plays out like it looks, we are going to have another rally that is lower than 8.5. Probably mid 7s. At that point a retest of 5.8 becomes extremely likely. It may not break down on the first touch but it will be loaded to go if we have yet another rally that stops in the mid sixes. When it drops from they're going to 5300 seems pretty likely. This pattern has been stair stepping down all year long and there is no indication it's going to stop right now. Every time we attempt to Rally, resistance is lower than the last one",

They're meant to give power back to individuals. It's completely pointless for a government to use Bitcoin, and defies the point of a national currency, since you can't control it and adjust the supply.\n\nBut there are ways countries could create their own crypto or crypto-like currencies as their national currency. It will not be decentralized, and might be something a bit like tether, attached to their actual money. This doesn't mean that people can't still use Bitcoin.\n\nI think in the future, we'll be using a lot of different currencies in tandem within the same country. Currencies won't be so much about countries, but about different functions.",

Venezuela with the Petro is the closest example.\n\n(South east Asian countries are in the mix too because they lead adoption on certain use case metrics.)\n\nBut it's very hard to make that call. I'm guessing wildly with my picks.\n\nWhich nation state has the most pro crypto leadership? Would odds lean towards a capitalist nation or a socialist?\n\n2 years ago people could not even imagine the CBOE trading futures, it was barely discussed.\n\nNow we discuss ETFs like there a real chance, and there is. Just now we can visualize it easier.",
