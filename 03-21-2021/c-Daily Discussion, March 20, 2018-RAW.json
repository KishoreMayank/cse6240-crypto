Of course the price does fluctuate and so it may go above or below 9000 again at any time but for the time being the price of bitcoin is similar to the situation of that episode of Dragon Ball Z.",

His reply is here: https://gist.github.com/harding/1c90e7deddc7394996f49d4c658af37d\n\nThis is not a new idea. It's a known thing since 2009 or 2010 that anybody can store things on the blockchain. It also contains stuff about the Tiananmen square incident which is illegal in China. Also at one point somebody added malware signatures to the blockchain so antivirus software thought bitcoin was malware. There's also an ascii-art image of Ben Bernanke.\n\nThis data is very non-trivial to actually access. Block files are opaque, huge data files, to extract anything from it needs specific tooling, that doesn't come with any of the node software.\n\nIt's a fairly common legal situation to have to deal with other people's crap, e.g. ISPs have exemptions for this kind of stuff because proactive enforcement there is too expensive. Also for any kind of legal problems you'd have to prove intent, unless people had specific tools for analyzing the blockchain that won't happen.\n\nAlso for years bitcoin users and miners have been able to enable pruning if they don't want to store the blockchain. So what that says about \"all blockchain data is downloaded and persistently stored by users\" is rubbish too. The blockchain is one of the least efficient storage methods ever invented, in the long term the problem will fix itself because miner fees will make this kind of thing not economical.\n\ntl;dr Ignore the FUD.",

            "Text": "Perhaps there is a way when pumps and dumps occur but I have yet to test it extensively enough to tell if it's mere coincidence or what. Switch to the 1m chart, draw a horizontal line at the bottom of the candle *before* the \"pump\" candle and extend it indefinitely. The next time the candle touches the line, it may be the bottom. Why? Possible explanation: because pump and dump groups buy at *that* one candle before starting the pump, sell at whatever rip they see fit and buy again at that same initial level, therefore rising the price again. Again, not sure if it's mere coincidence but I've seen it happen several times before. See https://www.tradingview.com/x/afHbSxQz/",

For stocks, the deathcross matters because it\u2019s hard for a company to reverse a downward trend since it\u2019s backed by actual capitol, performance and revenue, so it does act as an indicator of sorts. However, bitcoin is free to fluctuate at the whim of the market so it shouldn\u2019t matter. ",

I agree 6k is very possible. Maybe even 5.5k. Ive preached this possibility for the last few days in here myself. \n\nBitcoin has crashed before, it will crash again. And agin. And again. \n\nWhat history actually shows is that the crashes only propel it to greater heights in thr long run. \n\nSo that\u2019s why you and your deliberate FUD are harmless and try as you may, ultimately ineffective. \n\nI also browsed your comment history and saw that amidst the constant fudding, you got out of Bitcoin during the Gox era - which is very telling - if I sold @ $1000 id FUD too in hopes the price would fall back down.

If you want to exercise this, show me the images on the blockchain.  You can't without putting it all together using an external mechanism and that is no different than putting it together from any other source of information.  Because you can do this with any source of information that had the characters needed.  The issue isn't the blockchain or those sources of information, it is the intent and actions of the individuals putting it together and violating the law.\n  \nThink of it like language.  We all know the alphabet and can use it to say whatever we want.  We can string it together in many ways that do not violate the law and the alphabet on its own is not a violation of the law.  But we can use language to violate the law by stringing characters together and presenting them in a certain way that breaks the law.",
