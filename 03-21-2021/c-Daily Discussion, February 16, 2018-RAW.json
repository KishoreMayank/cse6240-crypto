Most of them probably got away during the last few weeks crash. \n\nSentiment is what matter. Sentiment about bitcoin was on the low everywhere online since unconfirmed transactions were stuck over 100k, a while ago. Now, sentiment suddenly turned around last week since the last few big announcement. No reason for the whole market to come crashing down again if the sentiment is still as good. We might not get an enormous bull run in 2018, but a slow decrease from 10k? No way, not with the current sentiment. Slow increase is totally plausible, tho.\n\nOf course a big news or a big rumor/some fud could make everything come crashing down. That's the risk of putting money in crypto. \n\nIf you actually believe you can predict the \"bubble pop\" or the next \"bull run\" by how many comments on reddit makes you feel like they are from people expecting to get rich quickly... I am so sorry. For your own good, re-evaluate.",

            "Text": "I think they will, eventually. Banks pretty much perceive an opportunity to transfer money for a customer as an opportunity to generate profit via transfer fees. Customers want to purchase crypto and/or send fiat to exchange accounts. I think it's going to take some regulation to help \"protect\" them, and they'll make that happen.  As an example, credit cards are able to treat purchases different from cash advances. So you purchase goods and it goes on your balance at a certain interest rate. But when you use the same card account for a cash advance, that portion of your balance can be subject to a different interest rate. And they are able to say that payments toward your balance go towards one or the other first.",

This will result in your making better decisions in the long run.\n\nOtherwise, you really increase your likelihood of really being agent FUBAR.",
