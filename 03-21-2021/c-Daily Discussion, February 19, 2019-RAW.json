What anyone who supports bitcoin should want is additional adoption - period. That means that eventually anything and everything that people do with fiat they can do with bitcoin. That includes buying a pizza, ordering something online, investing, etc... and yes that includes an ETF along with multiple other investment options. People around the globe associate an ETF with legitimacy and that's a win for bitcoin once we get one. It would lead to a multitude of other developments. It's not about wanting banks to 'save' anyone, it's about ADOPTION.",

Gold is different as it shares only the store of value component of use with Bitcoin but not the limited supply. You're missing the much MUCH bigger picture here. Once an ETF is approved, it would set in motion a public perspective of legitimacy, and the spin off effect and additional adoption that would result would dwarf the smaller issue of any manipulation enabled by the first approved ETF. Math dictates that manipulation becomes less and less possible when the amount used to action such manipulation becomes an increasingly smaller percentage of the whole.",

I am simply saying that you can not support total adoption and then make exceptions. ETFs are a growing investment vehicle  choice in today's world. If you truly believe that Bitcoin will succeed then forget about the potential manipulation of an ETF. The market will mature and besides, every ETF provides varying options and mechanics.
