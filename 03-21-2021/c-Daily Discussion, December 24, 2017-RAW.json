This is the same exact shit I was staring at in September when it was $3,000 and not $13,000. It had just fallen 45% in value from $5,000. I looked at those $3,000 bitcoins like they were toxic waste. You couldn\u2019t get me to put a dime into them.... that dip and this one... they are identi-fucking-cal. It hovered around $3,500-3,800 for weeks after the \u201cdead cat bounce\u201d to $4,150. Imagine looking at the prices fall again from $4,150 to $3,500 and how you might feel just when you thought it was all over. THATS WHERE WE ARE NOW. But it never quite got back down to $3,000 and and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019ll ever quite get back down to $10k as is the case now. And then it slowly just took off again after a month long recovery. This time next year... if you all hold on, you\u2019ll be buying much more expensive Christmas presents in the form of cars or TVs for those with not a lot of coins lol Long story short: buy more or hold. Don\u2019t sell. And only trade down if you know what you\u2019re doing and good luck even then. ",

From what I can tell from your comments and questions many of you are new to cryptocurrencies and are looking to make a bit of money and some actually interested in it. Regardless of what category you're in, you should do your own research, don't rely on a random guy sitting behind a screen to tell you what to do! What makes you think they know best? Why trust your hard earned money to some guy you don't know? Do your own research so as to make informed decisions and you will soon realise most people have no idea about what they are talking on these forums! To help you out I will share two links one is on cryptocurrencies in general and the other is about bitcoin futures that are changing the market.

It's like the subreddit explains exactly what types of users we have.\n\nHodlers (true and intelligent ones) appear in times of bull markets to help and educate noobs. When the market falls, at first we see all the \"Chill out guys\" post, but then they dissapear as it is impossible to talk with fear.\n\nNoobs on the other side, well it's pretty much obvious, extremely optimistic in bulls markets and extremely pessimistic in bear markets. No points in between. These are the true victims of price speculation, as most simply do not have the stomach and self control to sail through the storms. Worse, most don't have the wit to capitalize gains and strategize investments in bull markets. It makes me sad that most will not come back, and worse, feel extremely frustrated after the storm has passed.\n\nAnd there's a fuck ton of FUD/FOMO spreaders that clearly have an agenda. Sometimes they try to disguise themselves as noobs or even worse, as wise hodlers. Fuck them.. really...",

I\u2019ve got a more nuanced question about capital gains for crypto\u2026 I\u2019ll explain using an example: let\u2019s say I bought 5 BTC at $2k earlier this year, and then sold last week at $15k \u2014 for a $65k realized short-term capital gain. The same day as the BTC sale, I poured the entire $75k in proceeds into ETH at $750 per coin (i.e., I bought 100 ETH). ETH then, hypothetically, plummeted to $250 overnight, and I sold it all \u2014 and got back $25k (i.e., I took a $50k capital loss). My question is this: can I use the $50k short-term capital loss on ETH to offset the $65k short-term capital gain on BTC? That\u2019s question one. If the answer\u2019s yes, that's fine, my next question would be: if I theoretically have a net short-term capital loss in the stock market this year, can I use those losses to offset some of the net $15k in short-term capital gains I have in crypto? Thanks in advance to the kind soul that helps me out here! ",

            "Text": "**Trading Question**\n\nSo, there\u2019s a reason I couldn\u2019t get through CalcIII when in university. There is something fundamental that I\u2019m missing when I calculate a currency conversion for making Limit orders:\n\nSay **XTC** is trading at 9039USD or 15ETH and I want to buy it for 8437USD which, when I use cryptonator.com/converter at 22:00-UTC, it calculates 8437USD to be 14ETH.\n\nSo, I place a Limit Order for 14ETH at that time. One hour later (at 23:00-UTC) my order has been Filled at 14ETH.\n\nBut now - at 23:05-UTC - when I plug 14ETH into the calculator the USD value of my **XTC** is *8395USD* - not my intended goal of 8437USD - *or 42USD less*.\n\nI know there is something *seriously wrong* (e.g.: dumb) here (along with my thought process) - and its to do with the Exchange Rates of the USD to ETH; and its fluctuations over time.\n\nCan anyone help and/or point me to the answers and the basic theory that I\u2019m missing?  Thanks.\n\n[Lord, I feel so stupid]",

Truly brilliant people are buying and selling during highs and dips and making FAR more than anyone just holding.  \n\nBitcoin has a serious problem right now because it was 100% not ready for prime time.  It would cost the average person less to use western union to transfer cash to family internationally than with bitcoin.  That right there means bitcoin is failing to deliver the product it claims to be.  Either it\u2019ll work this cluster fuck out in the next few months or it\u2019s going to lose its cushy spot as the king on crypto.  It\u2019s not even an argument that there are other cryptos that do everything bitcoin does MUCH faster and cheaper.  So screaming HODL while those facts stand true is pretty meaningless.\n\nBitcoin has gotten us here.  There\u2019s nothing promising it\u2019ll be what gets us to the finish line, and the realization of a new and freer global economy that is built on cryptocurrency technology.",

If there are more transactions than can fit in a block, the highest fee in Satoshis per byte is processed and the rest have to wait. \n\nSo fees rise the longer there are unprocessed transactions, because more people are \"competing\" to get processed. \n\nIt's not at all based on percentage of transaction value.

We closed on Christmas Eve at 6pm and literally there would be hundreds of people trying to get in at 5:59pm to get last minute gifts. The store got pretty tore up on Christmas Eve. Then again, your talking about the people of Walmart...but...the general public isn't too far off from that. Not only that, but people put flights and gifts on credit cards, and when they see their bills they probably wish they had some cash to get them down. I don't know if this is causing any drop in bitcoin, but damn, people really do procrastinate...a huge amount do. Its like a rush, they live off the stress and adrenaline of waiting till the last dang moment. ",

This is the time of day this shit briefly runs upward (around 5-6pm eastern) then tanks (thanks Asia). What I think were seeing is a consolidation around $13.5-$14.5k similar to the consolidation after September\u2019s crash when it consolidated around $3,700 for a couple weeks after falling from $5k to $3k. We had the same run up after each crash ($4,150 and $16,150). Eerily similar and it\u2019s got me very bullish now. ",

Just prepare yourself for some excitement ahead, and learn to leave your emotions at home. This is not a game for buyer's remorse, fear, or over analysis. \n\nSpend some time (if you haven't already) learning about the underlying technology and the real issues. Are you buying because it's a store of value, a deflationary currency, or a quick buck? Think about what a good investment timeframe could be for yourself and stick to it. Keep your ear to the ground and determine what it would take to cause you to exit this position. If that condition is not met, be happy with hodling.  \n\nNo one is going to hold your hand, there's no training wheels here, but sticking to some principals might get you where you aim to be. \n\nOh and don't fucking go into debt or trade crypto on margin, that's asking for trouble.

            "Text": "in thousands of usd i think those will be the key swing points from right now. thats the path I think it will take. Low trading volume does not effect price movements just slower movement, maybe more zigzags. \n\nVolume is accumulative - by which i mean this - if 100 people buy and hold at 1k and 100 people buy and hold at 10k you have 200 people holding. As long as more people who want to buy and hold than people who want to sell price goes up. \n\nso you can have say 100k people buying and holding and price will go up so long and there are 2 buyers and 1 seller. those buying and holding can't buy more (unless the sink more assets) so buyers dwindle and then some people sell and suddenly theres no demand for everything held by the holders. that's a bubble bursting.",

When he sells that BTC for $6800 he would need to pay capital gains taxes on the $5500 profit he made.  Now compare that to buying $25 worth of BTC every week for a year.  52 x $25 is also $1300, so the amounts will be the same.  It's just that now he has 52 transactions to keep track of instead of 13.",

            "Text": "Obviously this is really tricky to work out. It is *the* question. My own view, as a hodler who has felt the pain of the losses like all of us, is as follows: take a look at the yearly view on www.coinmarketcap.com you can see it was creeping up comfortably to $7000 until 10th November (all dates are approximate), then there was a significant dip to $6000. At that point it lurched back up. Within a week it was pushing $8000 dollars. After that is when the real mania started. From 24th November the gains were enormous - this was the true speculative rush. Now, let's say some proportion of that speculative money, 10% or so, is convinced by the technology and the movement behind Bitcoin, so the dip can only go so low. For this reason I'd say this dip, this bearish movement, has the potential to go to $8000 per coin. Being utterly pessimistic, $6000 per coin, but that is very pessimistic. And then there may well be a drawn out, largely flat period. Once its flat and people see it is not going any lower, they will realise that there is confidence still in this thing and people will begin to store there money again in Bitcoin (remember, a lot of people will be happy if there money just remains at a stable value; the UK has 3% inflation at the moment, so anything better than that is a win).\n\nHere's a theory of how this works: most hodlers would have started out as speculators (they may not admit this!), they believed that they could put some fiat in, realise the gains and then take fiat back out. After going through this cycle, some losing through panic selling (I was one of them once) they learn a bit more and realise that hodling would have served them better over the long term. Their money may have been sitting in their bank account earning 0%. They also realise, once they see the value of cryptocurrency, that one day more and more people will too, so people will prefer to sell property (for instance) for Bitcoin, and many will have to buy Bitcoin (or some crypto) to buy that property. Each dip will settle at a higher point as more and more move to a hodler position.\n\nHope this is somewhat helpful. Good luck.",

In reality that would never happen of course and the money moved is normally a significant fraction of the change in market cap, but it illustrates that these two numbers are only very loosely correlated.\n\nThe market cap depends on what people think bitcoin is worth and if 100 billions go off it doesnt mean people have sold for 100bn",

I get we need consensus, but I want to understand why anyone would disagree.\n\n>It would increase storage and bandwidth requirements, which would drive centralization.\n\nDrive centralization is this the reason? Why do so many people say this is a bad thing. The number one complaint about BTC are the slow transactions and high fees. Why is this important than those?\n\n>It would only be a temporary fix.\n\nThis doesn't matter. We have a problem apply the quick fix now, while we work on a permanent one. \n\n> It would require development work that is better spent on proper scaling.\n\nOkay so changing the block size is a exorbitant amount of work? I had no idea. Maybe this is why?\n\n>There are already other cryptocurrencies that address the speed and cost issues (and now there's bcash on top of all those).\n\nNot talking about those.\n\n>I want proper scaling for the long term, not quick fixes that just kick the can down the road.\n\nOnce again apply the quick fix now, while working on the long term one. \n\n>Don't forget, too, the problems with Bitcoin are being greatly exacerbated by the bcash tx fee spamming every difficulty adjustment. Yes, it's a vulnerability, but one that requires a large bankroll, and it's not likely to happen often.\n\nDon't know what these words mean, so i'm going to nod my head.\n\n---\n\nAm I understanding correctly?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nTo add to the 2nd one, I did some googling and apparently running a full node already has high requirements.\n\nAre making these high requirements higher really going to affect the average person, and how centralized BTC already is?",

I'm happy with the BTC I acquired at about $13 (wouldn't be surprised if some of it was from the idiots here who panic sold), but let's be cautious and real. The rise from $10k to $20k was a bit too damn fast. Many of us were skeptical that it was truly over when it looked like it was already recovering yesterday. A bear that lasts several more days isn't out of question at this point.  \n\nThe best course of action? Be ready to celebrate if $14k truly is support. But if it starts creeping below $10k, expect mass panic and prep a few buy orders.",

Party #1 and #2 are than able to make an unlimited amount of payments while the ledger remains open. However, once Party #2 signs the ledger, the block is netted out and a singular transaction is posted to the blockchain, thus finalizing the 50-100 micro-transactions into one lump settlement payment. The money that you commit to the channel is like a reservation fee. I do not like this solution because it lacks security - any transaction that is performed off of the blockchain can be disputed, Party #2 can choose not to sign the ledger, or the ledger could be electronically tampered with.",
