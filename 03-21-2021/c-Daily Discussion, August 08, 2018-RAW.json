I made [a blog about it here](https://blog.akash.network/2018/04/09/my-testimony-as-an-expert-witness-for-the-first-ever-blockchain-bill-ab-2658-introduced-in-the-state-of-california/).\n\nIn summary the gist of CA AB 2658 proposes to simply define blockchain technology in statute (not including smart contracts) to provide users and businesses greater certainty. It suggests blockchain technology to be defined as an electronic record under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). I assume this will be used when there is a legal issue between parties, taxes, labeling, identifying e.g., so then CA businesses and individuals can point to this bill in case of disputes.",

They lower the price, then scoop up all the weak hands before they buy back into BTC. And they keep doing it because it works. But then they have to get back in before the price naturally rises, so we'll see a giant green dildo in the next couple days. The only way to get their money is to buy when it seems most bleak. It forces them to pay more than they wanted to acquire their BTC, and adds strength to support levels.",

Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.

(or at least, don't short it right now).\n\n*(I'm not an expert and this is not a financial advice, DYOR, I'm biaised because I own some dust of BTC that I want to see moon, don't blame me if BTC is going further down because that's an equaly probable possibility, blah blah blah).*",

Looks like a manipulation big time and I'm not fooling ya, it's just the same. \n\nIt also seems that Bitcoin price and ETC Coinbase listing are not accidental. Just when the ETC hype reached its climax, nearly the same second, ETFs were delayed. So ETC in two shakes went down from $20 to $16You can talk what you want but I think somebody has just earned a loooooot of money. Can't wait to be done with this shitty market.",

It has caused huge market confusion - and this has been a deliberate strategy by Ver (not necessarily by Bcashers.)  The poor performance of cryptos during 2018 can be attributed partially to all that lying and misdirection.\n\nBut that coin too is dying @ 0.09 (as it should IMO, as it is discredited.) \n\nBcash is also now riddled with internice wars - this is what happens when conmen get together on a project.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bitcoin is the major coin and will be the most resilient against negative market forces.\n\n\n\n",

Buying anytime the price drops below 6k is a reasonable strategy, whether you try and time your selling with the big players or just hold is a personal decision. I prefer buying low and holding out for a few years, and after a very long time, I'm convinced I'll thank myself in 5 years or so.",

That huge run up in December was a combination of all variations of average Joe's and their gardeners and big players.\nPeople who didn't know bitcoin from a turnip were jumping on coinbase and buying anything from $50 worth to mortgaging their homes. It was pure hype driven inflated value that couldn't possibly be sustained. What we need is that same volume of investment plus much more, but based on confidence, easy onboarding, mass usage and global infrastructure. A quick scan of the global efforts underway and it appears this is coming down the pipe and throughout the next decade we will likely see it unfold. Until then all we have is radical opinions, people diving into the weeds of topics like how an ETF will function, conspiracy theories, and FUD. Bitcoin may be a different beast, but it is evolving very much like early companies like Amazon, early stages of innovations like e-commerce and the early stages of dot com business we have seen in the past. The only thing that will bring this to where many of us want it to be is time.",

It was overinflated due to the typical hype cycle most all innovative technologies see at the initial stage of growth. Nobody, whales included can retain any influence over that kind of volume. But that could not be sustained. Now days, it's simply a matter of a huge percentage of traders trying to cash out on every micromoment, and anticipating that each other will do the same. This too, is simply another stage we must endure. It's the stage of greedy fools trying to capitalize on every turn. In exchange for this, they give up their lives, and a part of their sanity. So in the end, nothing makes more sense than holding a new technology.",

Thats a guaranteed value loss with dollars, and a maybe value loss if I put my money in bitcoin. But im not talkijg about yesterday and today. Im thinking about yesterday and 2025. Where, i could beat i flation by 4-ish oercent in the market...or make mich larger gains with bitcoin...im hoping for somewhere in the 500-1000% range.  But all this depends on where i value bitcoins versus dollars...and I cant wait to use bitcoin as much as i do dollars.",
