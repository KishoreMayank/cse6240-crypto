            "Text": "Reposting here for greater exposure:\n\n\nI can see bitcoin gaining traction initially as a supplemental currency rather than a complete replacement to fiat. \n\n\nHere are just a few reasons everyday people might like to convert from fiat to bitcoin:\n\n- transactions to replace wire transfers. Tiny fees compared to using banks. Especially international wires. \n\n\n- when traveling to other countries that accept bitcoin it makes it easy to pay anyone anywhere in the world in one kind of currency instead of having to convert to local currency. \n\n\n- online transactions. So that credit card companies don\u2019t have a detailed record of every purchase you make and cannot resell your data to advertisers. This is a privacy issue. \n\n\n- adult entertainment.  I prefer anonymity when purchasing my adult entertainment. Bitcoin can do that in the sense that nobody will know who I am. They will only know my wallet address. The adult industry alone is extremely huge so this is a real use case. \n\n\n- gambling industry including sports (privacy and security)\n\n\n- paying international gig workers (simplifies currency conversion issues)\n\n\nLater on, once bitcoin reaches a sustainable price stability, merchants will begin to realize they could save on transaction fees by accepting bitcoin.  Credit card payments will begin to fall out of favor as merchants begin to offer incentives (discounts?) to customers who pay with bitcoin. They will do this because it will be more efficient to accept bitcoin than cash due to the issues involved with handling cash (administrative accounting, physical handling and its easy to steal cash). \n\n\nThis is just a small glimpse of bitcoin\u2019s potential from my POV. I\u2019m sure others could add to this list. \n\n\n\n",

Who cares?   \n\n\nOr is it because people who invested last year (including my 80 year old mother-in-law)   \nin December lost faith seeing the prices go down, and turned away from crypto and blockchain?  \n\n\nOr is it because I can not go down to the supermarket and buy milk, bread and wine with Bitcoin? Or even pay my bills? (it is actually not good for anything in real life, yet)  \n\n\nOr it is because the big companies, banks, organisations are afraid to step in, because it is too volatile?   \n\n\nWell, I think I just answered all my questions, but thanks for reading it this far,   \nhere is a smiley for you.....because we will go up sooner than you think....I don't see any reason not to  \ud83d\ude00",

Roughly 8 hours ago, it hit a low of $140.8 bill much faster than anticipated especially considering $220 bill several weeks ago. Nearly 40% of the crypto market cap has been wiped very fast which has not happened since the Jan/Feb. fall from $830 bill. Of course, I\u2019m not infallible and the crypto market could fall to $90 bill but I do genuinely believe we are very close to rock bottom if we haven\u2019t hit it already. I knew the $6K Bitcoin support level was bullshit. I rightfully predicted Bitcoin would fall to $4200-$4800 and I\u2019m still convinced that it will fall to $3800 for a brief moment which would result in a low crypto market cap than $140 bill. And the Tether implosion hasn\u2019t even happened yet. Anyone who thinks Bcash is to blame for this recent fallout is an idiot beyond repair. It\u2019s manipulation as always, the same manipulation that could occur when Tether collapses which could be no effect on Bitcoin. When an ETF failed in August, Bitcoin\u2019s price remain unchanged. Then 10 days later, Bitcoin mysteriously fell by $500. Manipulation. Manipulation. Manipulation.",

I would see Bitcoin ads everywhere including social media and Google. I would see TV ads encouraging retired seniors to buy Bitcoin. Then January happened and Bitcoin advertising took a huge hit. Many Bitcoin investment agencies hopped on the Bitcoin bandwagon way too late. By the time they started routinely airing Bitcoin ads in January 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price was only falling down from $20K. What this taught me is the potential of the Bitcoin bandwagon. It\u2019s kinda like tattoos which were originally stigmatized as punk culture and evolved into the mainstream pop culture. Everyone is susceptible to being a follower. This is exactly why Bitcoin has the potential of surpassing $1M and beyond. There\u2019s an excellent YouTube video explaining this phenomenon called \u201cFirst Follower: Leadership Lessons from Dancing Guy.\u201d Even the biggest Bitcoin cynics can succumb to buying Bitcoin eventually.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ",

Like Bitcoin was already falling in August down from earlier $9,000 high down to $6K and since announcement of Bakkt, Bitcoin has fallen even more to $4K. I guess this is why Cryptogrip really wants a 4K TV since it will be worth more than 1 BTC.",

Welcome to the immutable ledger.\n* Porn - see dot points 2 and 3\n* Gambling - BTC is unregulated gambling with a lot a dodgy players involved and loaded dice.\n* Paying people - that's fine as long as the purchasing power is stable. At the moment if you were to use BTC is money then you're be experiencing hyperinflation.\n\nIn terms of merchants using BTC, you've got two major hurdles there. Firstly, the blockchain does not scale well. This leads to things like lightning network and the lightning network will just lead to centralised payment processors (like VISA or Paypal) who will charge fees, give credit etc etc. The other issue is money laundering and tax avoidance. You may not like tax or care about money laundering but I like to drive on roads, send my kids to school and not help out drug dealers and terror groups.",

            "Text": "One of the oldest sayings on Wall Street: \"A long-term investment is a short-term investment gone wrong.\"\n\n   \n\nBTW, Roger Ver and Faketoshi don't explain the previous drops, i.e., from 12000 to 10000, 10000 to 8500, 8500 to 7500, or 7500 to 6400. The more likely explanation for this drop is that a lot of investors who bought in late 2018 and early 2017 hoped for another run-up in late 2018 to make up their losses, and when that didn't happen they finally capitulated and sold -- probably not just a few to lock in losses for tax reasons to set-off against other investment gains.",

I agree about the administrative cost.\n\nI've been trying to encourage merchants about crypto adoption and here are the usual reactions I get.\n\n\\#1 FEAR. Merchants are afraid of anything that could change their legal, accounting and compliance setup. They are afraid of explosive IT costs and disruption. Many don't even know how to manage their own website, never mind set up their ecommerce differently. Then fear of the cost of training staff, and retraining due to turnover.\n\nThen is the chicken-and-egg problem. Nobody is spending it because nobody accepts it. Yes a few brave retailers are leading the way, but the overall population is still massively ignorant about crypto.\n\nThen some success from the FUD machine. Merchants want to avoid association with any and all scams. Merchants are not all stupid - most see through it, but at the same time their customer base, professional help (accountants, lawyers) are all generally hesitant.\n\nNext is the confusion in the crypto industry right now: too many options and too much going on. People who barely understand bitcoin are not willing to consider segwit, BCH, BCH ABC vs BCH SV, Ethereum, DASH and sidechains until they better understand bitcoin, and that is still a few years off I figure.\n\nMerchants don't give a darn about freedom and economic theory, and they don't yet see the big opportunity to make more money. They are already setup to accept and handle cash, debit, credit and have built the fees into their business model already. They want fiat and the assurance of a bank balance.",

Going to take slow adoption, technological adaptation, slow acceptance of crypto and blockchain in society before it could reach 20 k again (which is peak exposure). Also, macro economic factors like inflation, recession etc. will play a role and the psychological recoverytime after a huge crash is long. 4-5 years before climbing would be positive, but i wouldn't be surprised if it takes longer. There's more room to drop the coming years, even to 1000 or lower. Exposure is extremely low, public interest declining. It is clear that there is huge overinflation of crypto prices. It doesn't correspondent with their actual utility. Alot of coins will dissappear, most of them will drop in value close to zero. The prices are based on hype for 99%.",

You have to keep track of profit/loss on every transaction, which adds a level of complexity that is impractical. I\u2019m mentioning this, because I\u2019m surprised to not see it discussed, and wonder what people are thinking. \n\nI\u2019m generally anti-bitcoin for environmental waste reasons, so I would prefer less use anyway (less mining actually. ) But only recently started thinking about this. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of a weird gray area , because SEC has also exempted BTC from some securities regulation on the grounds that it\u2019s a currency. CFTC regulates as commodity. That strikes me as very strange. \n\nThis will also have implications even if the wasteful aspects of POW are mitigated (by off chain transaction for example. ) \n\nTo my mind, these regulatory conflicts and ambiguities would need to be resolved for any cryptocurrency to actually be used in any significant capacity as a (legal) currency. \n\nDark net transactions will probably remain a viable domain for cryptocurrency transactions.

The other perspective is to look at Bitcoin as a commodity and in that view Bitcoin is pretty much worthless. It does not function as a currency and as the past year has shown, it is a terrible store of wealth.\n\nSo, if you wish to gamble and like the odds at $4xxx then buy some. If you don't like the odds at $4xxx then don't. But don't say $4xxx is cheap. $4xxx is only cheap if the alternative is more expensive but for there to be an alternative, Bitcoin would have to have some sort of practical utility.",

A LOT of people enjoy playing with risk money in this new market and unless you've been living under a rock, you may have noticed that Vegas, horse racing, sports betting, and high risk stocks are a HUGE industry. 2017 was great, the past year was bad and maybe next year will be either who knows.

Whether this actually happened or just traders reacting to the possibility of it happening is unclear.  My understanding is that this initially caused us to lose the $6k support.  Once we lost the support stop losses were triggered tumbling price further.  That\u2019s when we entered capitulation territory. Disappointingly, even some of the hodlers seem to have folded. \n\nI don\u2019t make decisions about an asset in a atmosphere of abject fear.  I made a decision a long time ago that I like the technology and want to support it. I think it will catch on over the course of years, not months.   Bitcoin has endured severe bear markets before and always comes back stronger.  This time will be no different.  ",

            "Text": "You know what they say about catching a falling knife ... \n\nFirst if you never invested in Bitcoin, get verified on a reputable exchange and buy a small amount of BTC. (Like 1mBTC) Just so you can test the workflow for the moment you want to pull the trigger.\n\nSecond, never buy more than you can afford completely loosin should BTC drop in price some more.\n\nThird, have a strategy and stick to it. Don\u2019t let your emotions get the better of you.\n\n4th, Have a look at the trading fee on your selected exchange. For example in Pro.Coinbase.com you have zero fee for a limit buy/sell order.\n\n5th, I\u2019ve never done it, but if you have a exit strategy to secure your winnings. \u201cStop Loss\u201d could be your friend. But they are easy to be triggered with the volatility of BTC. Again don\u2019t let your feeling get the better of you. It could save you from loosing money more than a hypotethical BGD after it got triggered.\n\n6. Learn about the tax situation of crypto in your country. The exchanges that does KYC can and will tell about your activity to the taxmen. Be ready. Don\u2019t listen to advices on internet and seek for professional help.\n\n\nAnd last, depending on the situation when you\u2019ll be verified and able to buy BTC, at least wait for a recovery signal.\n\nAnd very last, depending on how good you are to secure your key. If you want to hodl long term. Get the BTC out of the exchange to a wallet you control the key.\n\nVery very last, hardware wallet are 100euro a pop and might put your mind at ease. Again test the workflow with a small amount to send BTC to and from your hardware wallet. Buy the hardware wallet straight from the manufacturer. Do not buy it from amazon because they are pooling the stock with other vendo that might sell a compromised wallet.",

I remember buying my first Btc for $240 in cash through local bitcoins. I literally drove 30 miles because that was the closest person selling. At the time I thought it was one of the sketchiest things I had ever done but now and my only regret is not having purchased more. Putting money in then was harder than it is now because in my mind, bitcoin has proved itself. People know what it is,it\u2019s never been hacked, you can buy it anywhere and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going anywhere. I seriously believe in this tech and I\u2019m going full poor man mode and dumping everything I have into this while prices  are coming down. If it explodes on itself so be it. I\u2019d rather die broke following what I believe in than work 9-5 funding a 401k and wonder what could have been.\n\nAs far as price goes my crystal ball says 250k by 2025",

When it was just Bitcoin and it seemed simple people were willing to try it. Now it seems like people won\u2019t bother anymore. If it takes a techy to even remotely understand half this crap that means only techys will be participating. Vendors accept it here and there for purchases but usually through services that convert it at market value instantly to fiat currency. Bitcoin just does not seem feasible for everyday people...",

The problem with bitcoin is that a snowball effect resulted from people jumping on the bandwagon in hopes to grab a profit. Blaming this on Bitcoin is senseless. Bubbles are always a result of human greed and the deflating or bursting does not always reflect an issue with what was overpriced. For example, it is pure ignorance to compare tulips to the innovation of the bitcoin network which has multiple potential applications, many of which are unrealized. Nobody foresaw the application for which we use the internet today back in 1970 for example.",

Which means they jumped in the end of last year and that's the only graph they have seen. \n\nMy point is BTC was under \u00a31000 for a long time 2017. Does that mean BTC was fucked before it hit \u00a315000 last December? Or does it mean that \u00a315000 was a completely unrealistic propped up price and was always gonna fall hard this year. \n\nIf you can go from 1000 to 15000 in a few months, then we can go from 4000 to the Moon or crash to fuck all in the same time. \n\nMy personal view is Bitcoin is worthless as a currency until its stable and massive adoption has taken place but then Bitcoin is pointless for what we want it for now, which is to make money. \n\nSurely people will start buying now.

I'm unbothered. I've been a perma bull since 2014 and still am - but if you think that this is going to spring up to 8k in a month after blowing through 6k, 5k and flirting with breaking below 4k support levels - all within 24 hours - then you're either very new here or haven't been paying attention. \n\nThe sentiment is destroyed. It will take a good 2-3 years to revisit the ATH with very positive sentiment and lots of retail money. We have neither right now and are trending downwards with a vengeance. Do the math. ",

Why is bitcoin worth more than it currently is? \n\nThe poster you were responding to was talking about the fact that bitcoin at this point is an almost purely speculative investment. There are no real calculations you can use to determine what the price of bitcoin should be (most investments you at least have P&L statements, forecasts, market data, etc). That means the only thing that is driving the price of bitcoin is... what people think the price of bitcoin should be/will be. So, since the last year the price has pretty much steadily fallen, what makes people think it's going to reverse (other than \"it was 20k before, it will be again!\" which is starting to lose its luster).",

It's been ten years, I've been here for half that and I know many that have been here since the start as miners. I hate listening to blowhards who constantly use insults to make a point. It's almost as though you all want some sort of validation, or get some personal satisfaction from \"I told you so's\" as though it matters in the big picture.\nI mean let's be honest - if you truly are not invested, why are you wasting your time in here to 'warn' risk takers that they are taking a risk. Do you realize how crazy that is? Why don't you go down town and find some drug users and preach to them about the risks? Because that's not anonymous and you can't just jump on some thread and belittle others for your own personal sick satisfaction? Why not jump in a Reddit sub for cave divers and tell them they may lose their lives and that they are wasting their money and time on a rush that you don't feel is worth it??\nMy point ..we're all responsible for our own level of risk exposure and many like myself have solid investments outside the crypto market but very much enjoy playing around in here with 5% that I am OK with losing. I've felt some great rushes watching my $$ multiply many times and I've felt disappointment watching it fall. This is not the first year for Bitcoin like may of you seem to imply. Next year? We'll see and that's the fun of it!! You on the other hand, have no skin in the game and are just in here to tell us how bad our decisions are? Please. ",

IMHO, it will only survive this acquisition if it leaves Oculus management alone to do it's job.\n\nValve, on the other hand, is in the gaming business and, as such, is complimentary to the industry.\n\nIt's all relative to the perception of the consumer though. A great example is the iPhone. What's so special about it in contrast to Android phones? Apple's marketing in tandem with people's vanity. When VR heavyweights will find a way to socially reach a new user base other than well-paid gamers, it will lift off. Calling the sum of many years of work by different industry professionals stagnant is ignorant to say the least, considering that VR already at it's current stage achieves it's purpose - immersion. Have you actually tried a VR headset?\n\n&#x200B;",

But you seem desperate to convince that bitcoin is dead which is insane based on the growth. I've been messing around with this for years and my close friends have beein mining since the start (I love them but hate them too haha). You don't have to believe me, but get that silly price prediction nonsense out of your head and play the moves, up OR down. Or just hold and check back occasionally. If you had a lucky guess you NEED to accept that it was just luck. Everyone threw a guess in the hat and some were lucky. Bitcoin moves are determined by many variables and you need to first know what you 'don't' know. Nobody can predict Bitcoin, but take a guess and you might be right!!",

Very smart people dismissed the internet, the PC, cars etc. I'm not saying it's any worse to say that Bitcoin will 100% be a part of the future but there are two extremes to the scenario. Considering the foothold the crypto market already has in such a very short time, then I see no reason why it would stop maturing. Price of a coin is one thing, but the growth in this space in terms of infrastructure is rapid. If you dismiss that then you're dismissing a very important element of what defines future success.",

I've never viewed Crypto as a pure representation of value. Which is why I don't really have much BTC. What has always fascinated me is the tech not the money. And for that reason I'm heavy in Cardano I love their ethos I love Haskell and am learning Rust to develop dApps on their protocol. This is beyond speculation as you can see tech develop and see it work or not, but will it make me money. Maybe not from the Ada but being able to build smart contacts and dApps certainly will. \n\n\u00a315000 was ridiculous but as all other cryptos are tied to BTC so I have to follow. I wish last December had never happened and we could all be happy that the price average has increased from $4644 last year to over $6000 this year and was way below that in 2016. \n\nI basically think people will buy because it's cheap to answer your question though.

            "Text": "Brother you are so misinformed on this that I hesitate to continue this conversation, but, I'll hit some of your points and then allow you to flounder in stubborn ignorance.\n\nWhat you are calling technical analysis is an obtuse interpretation of the practice. What you are describing is a magic crystal ball that predicts price movement for guaranteed success. That is not what technical analysis is, and only a ignorant buffoon would believe that. Technical analysis is ACTUALLY a toolbelt of well-established methods to assist a trader in risk management, entry points, market psychology, etc. As opposed to looking at quality or value. If you need a more in-depth explanation on what technical analysis actually means, I suggest you read just the first chapter of TA Explained by Martin Pring. You won't, but you should.\n\nAll of the people examples you listed are fundamental analysts, so of course they don't use TA, that's not what they're experienced or educated in. Of course, they don't call TA bullshit, because you don't have a source for that. That would be like Chip Kelly saying West Coast is BS because he likes the run game better, which would be a dumb thing for a coach to say. What I think you'll actually find is more hedge fund managers saying \"I'm not good at TA, so I don't use it.\" Which is, in essence, how Buffett describes it.\n\nTA is very personal, and is better suited to high volume, so of course hedge funds wouldn't operate on TA.\n\nYou don't understand technical analysis, and you're chosing to be ignorant instead of open-minded. That's a bad idea in a market that has basically zero fundamental history, but to each his own I suppose.\n\nAlso, you did edit your comment, I copied and pasted it directly. It said  \"no one actually makes money using TA\". Reddit doesn't show asterisks within a certain time limit. You're a liar, too.",

Pimping Bakkt is an understatement; Bakkt was Cryptogrip\u2019s bottom bitch. He couldn\u2019t stop talking about it everyday. He was consumed by it as the next great savior of Bitcoin. He said by November (the date they announced it would  be released) that Bitcoin would be surging high. Instead, it has flopped hard and Bakkt keeps getting delayed. We are near $3K territory yet cryptogrip can\u2019t admit he was wrong and just take a break. The worst part about cryptogrip is that he doesn\u2019t even own any BTC (or a considerable amount) to be talking. He is not a stakeholder.",

I still haven't seen anyone give me an argument on what the fundamental value of a bitcoin is right now (I get the qualitative arguments, I understand the use case behind cryptocurrency, what I don't understand is what makes $4000 cheap? Could bitcoin exist and be a popular method of exchange at $3000? $300? $30? $3?)\n \nGive me a quantitative reason for why bitcoin should be $X  without referring to historical prices of bitcoin.\n\nPut another way, if I tried to sell a rock at $100 dollars, then I changed it to $50, that doesn't mean the $50 price tag for my rock is cheap just because it's now half off, because the rock was never worth $100 in the first place.

You don't need to keep trying to explain it to me.\n\n>As opposed to looking at quality or value. \n\nDon't forget about high frequency trading. That's similar to TA in that it's primarily based on price movements rather than fundamentals, but it actually works and is used by real traders because it's based on finding patterns from data rather than chart astrology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading\n\n>I suggest you read just the first chapter of TA Explained by Martin Pring. You won't, but you should.\n\nWhy do you think all the TA gurus spend all their time writing books and selling their methods instead of just making money using them? Could the scam be any more obvious?\n\n>TA is very personal, and is better suited to high volume, so of course hedge funds wouldn't operate on TA.\n\nIs that a typo? Hedge funds obviously love high volume.\n\n>that's not what they're experienced or educated in\n\nAlmost every successful investor understand TA, just like every successful astronomer understands astrology. That's how they know that it's bullshit. \n\n>Of course, they don't call TA bullshit\n\nBuffet - \"I realized that technical analysis didn't work when I turned the chart upside down and didn't get a different answer.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2014/06/02/technical-analysis-drags-down-performance/#5c38c4861a0c\n\nBuffet actually spent years studying technical analysis at the beginning of his career before he concluded it was worthless. Now we have enormous amounts of data at our fingertips and can quickly show it has no predictive power.\n\n>I'm not good at TA, so I don't use it.\n\nWho said anything like that? No one is good at TA, and anyone that understands what TA is knows that no one is good at it.\n\n>It said \"no one actually makes money using TA\". \n\nI stand my that. Maybe I rephrased it in the first 3 minutes so reddit didn't catch it, but then it must have taken you 8 minutes to write your very short reply. I honestly don't remember every time I change phrasing, but I don't see why it matters. You didn't use normal quote blocks, so I didn't realize you were even trying to quote me.",

            "Text": "Thanks. The main claim in the article you linked to is \"Bitcoin payments down almost 80 percent\". This looks like fake news actually - highly exaggerated. Yes if you choose the highest high and compare to the current, anything will look like its dropping. That's what that article did. If you look at [a chart](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/trade-volume?timespan=2years) you can see a bigger picture. Usage is up from a little over a year ago. Volume has been dropping since the surge in price a year ago, pretty much tracking the price. So what this indicates to me is not that trading volume in bitcoins has declined over the past year, but that the price has declined and therefore the volume being transferred around has followed that price. So given that information, I'd have to disagree with you that adoption is \"going backwards\". Looks like at worst its staying flat. Which is what you'd expect based on historical precedent of people getting bored of bitcoin when the price isn't wildly fluctuating. Notice the uptick in transaction volume following the recent price upset?",

While there is no single definition of HFT, among its key attributes are highly sophisticated algorithms, co-location, and very short-term investment horizons.  HFT can be viewed as a primary form of algorithmic trading in finance.

            "Text": "I have to bite.\n\n> Astrology is well established too, but it also has no predictive power.\n\nThis is a great example, because astrology is exactly like TA in that it doesn't have a \"right answer.\" People who practice astrology use indicators to make decisions. Whether those indicators are \"fact\" or \"fiction\" is irrelevant. If you don't believe the stars actually send messages to people (I don't either), it doesn't negate the fact that some people do, and use it to their advantage or disadvantage. TA is not a book of rules, so whether you think the meaning behind it is bull or not, if it works for traders (and it does for some and not for others) it's kinda irrelevant what someone who doesn't learn it thinks.\n\n>Don't forget about high frequency trading\n\nYep, another method of trading that works for some. Like value investing or technical analysis for others. High frequency trading uses a plethora of technical indicators, for what it's worth.\n\n>Why do you think all the TA gurus spend all their time writing books and selling their methods instead of just making money using them?\n\nI forgot. Howard Marks, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, John Bogle never wrote a book. What a stupid argument. Getting wealthy off value investing requires a large amount of capital for the average trader, that's why technical analysts \"sell their methods.\" Because they can show you how to make asymmetrical trades with the right data. Warren Buffet doesn't have to trade BTC 5 times a day following the moving average to gain wealth. BTW, if you're paying for someone else's TA methods, you're doing it wrong.\n\n>Is that a typo? Hedge funds obviously love high volume.\n\nNot in the way technical analysts do, hedge funds don't trade AAPL or BTC 5 times a day.\n\n> Buffet - \"I realized that technical analysis didn't work when I turned the chart upside down and didn't get a different answer.\u201d\n\nEveryone has heard this quote. You hear \"bullshit,\" I hear \"I can't figure it out so I won't use it.\" Warren Buffet isn't an omniscient financial being, unless you think missing out on tech stocks somehow makes him a genius. He's a great value investor. He's not a great technical analyst. \n\n>No one is good at TA\n\nHow can you possibly say this when it just objectively not true?\n",

But, since fiat is \"default\" it's still very much associated with the price of goods, and controlled by central banking institutions to achieve target inflation levels to keep the currency \"healthy\".\n\nSo, since most people are paid in fiat, pay for goods in fiat (priced in fiat), and pay taxes in fiat, the price IN FIAT is really all that's important right now. As for the future? Sure, there's the possibility that all of those things could be done in crypto (good luck getting the government to accept crypto for taxes, but that's besides the point), in which case the price in crypto is going to be important.\n\nSo, what's important isn't that $10 is worth $10, it's that I know I can exchange $10 for a big mac meal. I know that tomorrow I can do the same, and that a year from now the meal will likely be slightly more expensive, but not terribly so. \n\nFor crypto, what's important is what I can buy with my crypto, so right now, that means what's important is the exchange to fiat. In the short term (and medium term), what's important on valuation is still the exchange to fiat. So you can still do some calculations on what that looks like. My problem is no one is doing that.

Especially international wires. \n\n- when traveling to other countries that accept bitcoin it makes it easy to pay anyone anywhere in the world in one kind of currency instead of having to convert to local currency. \n\n- online transactions. So that credit card companies don\u2019t have a detailed record of every purchase you make and cannot resell your data to advertisers. This is a privacy issue. \n\n- adult entertainment.  I prefer anonymity when purchasing my adult entertainment. Bitcoin can do that in the sense that nobody will know who I am. They will only know my wallet address. The adult industry alone is extremely huge so this is a real use case. \n\n- gambling industry including sports (privacy and security)\n\n- paying international gig workers (simplifies currency conversion issues)\n\nLater on, once bitcoin reaches a sustainable price stability, merchants will begin to realize they could save on transaction fees by accepting bitcoin.  Credit card payments will begin to fall out of favor as merchants begin to offer incentives (discounts?) to customers. They will do this because it will be more efficient to accept bitcoin than cash due to the issues involved with handling cash (administrative accounting, physical handling and its easy to steal cash). \n\n\nThis is just a small glimpse of bitcoin\u2019s potential from my POV. I\u2019m sure others could add to this list. \n\n\n\n",

Ie money but I don't think that's the case. If I say something it worth something and everyone else says it's worth that much then it is. \n\nIf I employ people I can choose to pay them in whatever means they will accept. People think this is trying to get around tax but it's not. If I paid people in sheep the government would be entitled to 20% of the amount of sheep I paid them not the value converted in to pounds or dollars of the sheep. It's up to them how they regulate sheep received. \n\nThere is nothing to stop shop owners trading instead of taking cash. As long as you declare what you received you could send back your tax return and not attach any Fiat value to it. \n\nThis year I made 3 cows, 12oz of gold, 24 bales of hay and a round of cheese. If that was worth over \u00a311000 then you would have to pay 20% of the value it was over by but not in pounds because in this extremely ridiculous situation I do not own any pounds. \n\nIf people and businesses get paid an pay in crypto. No one can force you to convert it in to you countries currency. But you still have to pay tax so as long as you say I got paid 10 BTC this year to the government They will have to find a way to accept it. \n\nBut none of this can happen unless BTC is stable. Which we wouldn't want would we coz then we wouldn't make any money.  \n\nPlease don't smash me for this post I'm being silly to show that value is up to the people not the government. \n\n",

As far as I can tell, in at least the Canadian income tax act (and I'm pretty sure it's the same everywhere) they specify that taxes MUST be paid in Canadian currency. Remitting taxes in local fiat is actually what gives the government the power to enforce usage of that currency, and further what gives them the power to impact the economy (Central banks will raise and lower interest rates of overnight borrowing to raise and lower inflation, as well as stimulating spending or saving depending on what they're looking to do). I can't see governments just shrugging and giving up the power to influence their economy because \"I was paid in bitcoin\".\n\nIf my entire holdings were in USD, and I was paid in USD, I would still have to remit my taxes in CAD (sure, I can convert my money, but that's the point, I still have to convert).",

In the next bull run, I will use some of the lessons and indicators of over- exuberance that I observed in this cycle and perhaps use it to my advantage. But this is a matter entirely different to the topic of whether it is worth buying bitcoin now. This is clearly a phase of irrational panic - a situation quite analogous but  opposite to what you are pointing I should have noted during the peak.\n\nI don't consider myself a genius for buying in 2016 nor stupid for not selling in Dec 2017. But I will try next time to perhaps time my sale at over exuberance period of next bull run at the risk of looking stupid then.",

I don't know the law as my country is dumb and doesn't have one written down haha. (or I'm just not a lawyer). But if you never hold currency of any kind... \n\n>I can't see governments just shrugging and giving up the power to influence their economy because \"I was paid in bitcoin\".\n\nI'm not saying they would shrug it off, if everyone just decided they were now only using crypto (which I know wouldn't happen straight away) they would have to except it. Governments are there for the people not the other way round. They will have to massively regulate it in the future but how do you regulate something like Monero you can't. Governments could ban it, but I would think that that would just make it more popular. \n\nAnd a thing I always think about (except income tax coz that just comes out my wage) is I chose to pay tax if everyone stopped paying tax out protest governments in 1st world counties couldn't do anything other than listen to the people and do what they have decided. \n\nYou said your Canadian? I don't know a massive deal about how it happened, but lots of people smoke weed in Canada I guess, they said they aren't gonna stop smoking weed and in my opinion quite rightly continued. So eventually it was made legal. \n\nIf people use crypto, say they are not gonna stop and just refuse anything else, then it's in the countries best interest to get on board. \n\nThis is all just a fantasy I know. But people resisted the internet it was just a bubble, why would anyone want or need such a thing. But I assume thoughout all the negativity from the opposition the beginnings of Amazon eBay and Google was slowly coming together people decided they didn't want to go to retail shops, wanted an easy way to sell their stuff and wanted immediate access to all the info the world has to offer. And it happened. \n\nI am by no means an expert on any of this stuff it's just my thinking but laws and regulations do change when the majority demand it. ",
