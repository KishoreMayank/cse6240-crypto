I've never traded anything but I have some spare cash (2k) and I've been watching the markets like it's a sport and would like to try my hand. Am I right at assuming that it wouldn't be worth it for me to try and time jumps and falls due to the transaction fees? Like if I bought in at 8800 and sold at 9400 with 2k would that be worth it?

In 2018 will we break our ATH maybe, but we will smash through our ATH within the next few years almost with 100% certainty.\n\nEvery month Bitcoin stays at these current prices it becomes the new norm, and the idea of $1k BTC from last year seems farther and farther away, and the downside risk gets further and further away.\n\nI don\u2019t mind the market getting boring in BTC we made enough gains to last the next few months...just create new support and I\u2019m happy. But I said this at $3k and it just kept going up...so it could happen anytime, I prefer a slow controlled rise.\n\nCrazy I know.",

If it makes a good bull run then your margins become better and your able to get out and short trade and you can set yourself up to win both ways, this strategy takes patience.

But we also learned on March 10, 11, and 12 that nobody wants to buy above 9.8k.  So here we go.  Half the active trading crowd is convinced it will not rise above 10k.  Half the trading crowd is convinced it will not fall below 8.5k.\n\nTo me, it means groundhog day, every day, until an external mover acts on the market.  Government crack down.  Exchange hack.  Trustee bankruptcy sale.  All the external possibilities are FUD related.  I struggle to think of a single external mover that is FOMO based.  And I struggle to see any internal mechanism (other than rank price manipulation) that will propel us out of this relative equilibrium.\n\nOne good thing it seems, is that this \"is\" the new equilibrium - which in and of itself could be good long term news.",

We are told that there are 1 million people joining every 12 hours and they are all prospective buyers. Add on top that the technology is developing and we are seeing adoption, improvements and developments in the blockchain industry. \n\nSooner or later it has to burst. The top lid can't keep it in. It might take a few weeks or perhaps month but this steam is cooking and there is only one way in the long term - that is UP.\n\nI respect the fact that corrections and retracements will also happen which is a good thing I believe. So 20K to 9K is one decent correction and I think it is good for BTC in the long run. \n\nAny views welcome.",

I'm 44 now.  100% of my paper profits are still in my portfolio.  I try hard to never liquidate/sell positions EXCEPT in the rare instance that I have to rebalance my portfolio per HBPP annually.  \n\nI have sold a LOT of bitcoin since I started investing in 2012 only because the ramp ups in price caused a massive imbalance in my portfolio goals.\n\nI live on strictly dividend yield now, but I live well below my income so I am constantly rolling weekly excesses into my portfolio to try to keep it at my specific percentages.  \n\nAccording to my analysis, even in an the event of multiple market catastrophes (lasting 3-4 years each), I should be able to live nicely until I am 236 years old, lol.\n\nBitcoin is just one part of my portfolio.  Bitcoin doesn't generate a dividend yield, so it's equivalent to gold or forex, not rental properties or dividend stocks.",

            "Text": "> I\u2019d be nearly a millionaire by now, in my 20s.\n\nI've been buying $125-$150 in BTC a week since 2012.  I've likely quite literally sold BTC worth 10s of millions by now.  My first BTC were acquired around $6.\n\nThe thing is, I don't regret any of it.  I bought rental condos thanks to BTC.  I've paid of both my primary residences.  I bought a 3-cabin sailboat last year and thanks to my investment portfolio -- not just BTC -- I am upgrading to a 5-cabin sailboat mini-yacht maybe this year.\n\nHaving $20 million now would have ZERO effect on my life.  ZERO.  I retired at age 41 and that was only a tiny bit thanks to BTC -- most of it was shrewd investing of 70-80% of my income while living more frugally than 99.99% of Americans.\n\nNow that I'm retired and have a true \"zero cost of living\" thanks to my investment portfolio, I don't have to worry.  Having $10 million more wouldn't bring anything to my life at all.  I never have to work again.\n\nI don't know anyone who timed the market well.  I know about a dozen bitcoin multimillionaires who never exited positions until they got to some insane valuation but these were guys who bought 100 BTC for $50 or less, lol.  I know a guy who had over 2300 BTC when I started and he never sold until it hit and he liquidated a few million worth back in the $2000-$3000 range and he has NO REGRETS at all.\n\nMy money works for me, I don't work for my money.  People who monitor the price of bitcoin every minute of every day have mental issues.  I look at my overall net worth once a month when it's time to reinvest some dividends or rental income checks after my cost of living.  That's it.  If my BTC is lower than the rest of my portfolio, I buy more BTC.  If my stocks are lower than the rest, I buy more stocks.\n\nI have no idea what BTC's price is any day of the month, just like I have no idea what ANH's price is either.  I just buy more of whatever is undervalued versus my portfolio.\n\nAnd I never regret \"what could have been\" because nobody gets rich with regrets.",

Its a weird time for BTC as it could go either way or it could just flatten out and ride the 8.9-9.4k for a while as that has happened before. My opinion is that buyers are setting the price and waiting for it to come to them. While the sellers haven\u2019t played out yet. It is my opinion there would have to be an outside driving force to drive it to 8k such as the Mt Gox selloff. (terd stain) I survived the first one and Ill survive this one.",

I definitely don\u2019t regret that trip, but I think I could have left a month or two earlier and still had savings left. \n\nI traveled for 15 months and had the experience of a lifetime, which is worth more than the money, really.
