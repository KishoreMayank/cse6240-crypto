He's a high school science teacher.\n\nQuebec has cheap hydro and there are small and large mines popping up all over.\n\nI friend of mine is an electrician and he's a no-coiner. But he knows about Bitcoin now because hes making a bundle working on people mining rigs. \n\nIts interesting to see the small entrepreneurs creating work from the mining boom. Consultants, people who will help optimize your rig. There are so many opportunities to make money help people make mines more efficient.\n\nThen this new  era of buying and selling mining equipment. That alone is growing big time, and the middlemen are making secondary income by leasing the equipment to mines during the time between the buy and sell. Why let it collect dust for a few weeks when you can use it.\n\n1 year ago it wasnt like this at all....it wasnt even like this 6 months ago. It's really great to see.\n",

Mike only owes 2 mBTC, so it's like he got 1. For Bill it balances out, so nothing changes for him, he was just a middleman.
