There\u2019s still 4 more days that the Physicist and Cryptogrip could be right even though their predictions have been wrong all year. How can you be so wrong all the time? Basically this tweedledee tweedledum team could actually be right if they just went the exact opposite of all their prediction. So, when they say something like...Dec. 17 bull run activated. I\u2019m like...ohh no this is a bull trap, a pump and dump because Cryptogrip and the Physicist thinks it\u2019s the next big bull run. Going completely against their predictions will serve you right.",

Price will go up, price will go down. McAfee will glance at his wiener. The death of bitcoin will be declared on reddit and elswhere. People will try to shill people.

            "Text": "Disclaimer: I believe in bitcoin so might be a bit biased, but will try to comment as unbiased as possible.\n\nI feel like sub $1000 is pretty hard to justify, since the entire market cap of bitcoin would then account for less than $18B. We are talking about a currency adopted by millions of people here. Even most silicon valley tech companies worth more than that, and they do not necessarily have the amount of developers that back bitcoin. The amount of investment bitcoin gets and technology alone should be worth more than $50B. On top of that I see nothing but good news on adoption growth. More ATMs, more Lightning nodes open up everyday, more ways to spend the coins etc etc.\n\nMy distress bottom is somewhere around $2200-2400 level, that is if people panic sell. Around those values you would always find people who would buy it in bulk as they would see it worth more just in Goodwill.",

If you're one of the few people that understand Bitcoin and it's fundamentals pick up the torch and push forward don't just ask around and wait for someone else to do it.
