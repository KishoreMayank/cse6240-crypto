That is, the average mining cost can never get cheaper, only more expensive.   \n\nWith that in mind, what would happen if bitcoin's market price were to drop below the average mining cost? No one will mine it at a loss (unless they enjoy wasting money) and the mining cost can't go down, so what would happen to bitcoin? I guess no new coins would be mined, and no transactions would be made without miners, and a currency that you can't send or receive would soon be worth nothing.\n\nNow I'm sure I'm missing some important thing because the developers must've thought about this scenario and a solution for it.",

            "Text": "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is an instrument to issue stocks which represent other assets.  The underlying asset can comprise of anything - real estate investments, stocks in a basket of companies, commodities (gold), etc.  \n  \nI've used them as an easy way to invest in S&P500 index companies for instance.  It's easier to purchase 1 ETF stock than 500 different ones and have to rebalance them constantly.  This is the typical application, and it's really useful for retirement funds, 401Ks, 529 (education savings), etc.  \n  \nThe ETF is anticipated because it would allow an \"easy\" way for non-technical savers to invest in Bitcoin in a tax-advantaged way.  This would surely increase demand and the price of BTC.  By the same token, it would also concentrate some power in the ETF manager (in the case of deciding which fork to support, etc.).  Other criticisms include a lack of ability of the investors to actually use their coin, security concerns, and pushing bitcoin further towards being a speculative asset instead of a currency.",

No where near. \n\nPeople are working on Smart contracts for Bitcoin . scaling is coming along well. The lightning network is coming along well. There is more going on at Bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency. When you look at the prices and you think boy Bitcoin sure looks expensive compared to everything else. It isn't. There's actually a really good argument it's undervalued compared to everything else in the crypto space",

Say there's a chain split - the ETF fund can either keep both chains' coins, or sell one to buy more of the other.  In either case, your ETF share price has now increased without you having to do anything, or declare taxable gains.  As with other ETFs, you would only have to pay taxes when you actually sell your ETF share for a profit.  \n  \nOn the other hand, you can't actually access or use the funds - you can only sell your ETF share through your broker.  It also doesn't encourage holders/investors to run their own node, signal a BIP (as occurred with UASF), or do any of the other things which might make one a responsible bitcoin citizen.",

If there is less financial incentive to add up to the nehash, the less profitable miner will quit the network. The difficulty will go down.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs long as the value of newly minted bitcoin + value of the transaction fee that could fit in each new block is above the value of the cost of running a mining operation the network will continue growing.\n\n\u200b\n\nInversely, if the value of newly minted bitcoin + value of the transaction fee doesn't cover the expense, the less profitable mining operations will leave the network untill the difficulty adjust lower to an equilibrium.\n\n\u200b\n\nLet's say right before the next halving with the tech available, the value of newly minted BTC (12.5) + fee is just covering the expense of mining:\n\nAll other things being equal (efficiency, cost of electricity, nethash) once the block reward halve:\n\n\\- Half of the nethash has to leave,\n\n\\- The new tech need to be twice as efficient,\n\n\\- The reward BTC (6.75 + fee) has to cover the expenses: Thus, the fee has to go up, or the value of BTC has to go up => the miner cannot impose the price of either has the network continue to carry out. It's a competition between them and only the most efficient will keep on hashing away.\n\n\u200b\n\nor a combinaison of those factors.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200bAssuming the decrease of nethash is gradually decreasing, BTC could network could be supported by 2 PC running SHA-256 on a 486-DX4 while not pressing the turbo button. But in that case, the value of BTC will go down to next to nothing because the security level will be crap. If a large part of the network would leave at the same time, the block time will get so enormous that the blockchain confirmation will get to a halt, hopefully LN will carry-on untill the difficulty readjust after 2016 blocks. But t that\u2019ll be catastrophic\n\nOne could argue that the maximum value BTC could reach is the cost of running the most efficient tech, at the least expensive electricity rate possible, at the least cost of labor for the maintenance of said tech, and the maximum luck (maximum centralisation sorry). Not some logarithmic bullshit we see sometimes as prediction.\n\n1) BTC goes up AND difficulty keeps on going up, it means there is still some margin of profit for the miner, so it means that BTC is over-evaluated. \n\n2) BTC goes up AND difficulty stabilise it means we\u2019re at an equilibrium and the price is right.\n\n3) If difficulty goes down because BTC goes down in regards of current difficulty. It means that BTC is under-evaluated and miners cannot cover the cost of securing the network.",

I would not trust it though. Markets like to do the opposite of what people expect. If a lot of people are expecting it to go up but nobody actually *buys*... well, I think it will go down.\n\nThat's the one thing /r/buttcoin has on us... it is true. For bitcoin to keep rising, someone has to be willing to buy it at a higher price than we did. It's just math... which is why I believe bitcoin will eventually settle not at an ATH, but in a boring valley, after a huge \"bust\" cycle. We could be seeing that final stabilisation now, or it could be next time, or the time after... Many people will get \"screwed\" and there will be no new ATH to \"HODL\" for unless they wait *years*.\n\n",

More people willing to buy at 1000 than 10000. Reducing supply should naturally meet then exceed an inherently growing demand. Once you've shook the loose hands you'll have no more BTC on the market to sell, and the same demand that was allowing falling prices with larger supply will enable rising prices with no supply.",
