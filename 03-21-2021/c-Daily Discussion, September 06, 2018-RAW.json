I'm sure everyones heard that story of the guy who bought lots of coins in 2010 or whatever and then lost the flashdrive with his private key. Also, if there is no manner to retrieve lost coins then the amount of inaccessible coins will only go up causing deflation right? is there a mechanism to combat this other than telling everyone to not lose their keys/seed phrases?",

A guy looked at coin transactions and decided to treat all coins that did not move for 5 years or more as lost.

It turned out that at least 18% is lost.\n\nThere is no way to get back lost coins. Deflation is inherent in Bitcoin. This is why it will never be adopted because it creates value out of thin air.",

The bitcoin blockchain is an open and public ledger, tracking coins is trivial for anyone interested in doing so. Transactions from the exchange to your address, and from your address to the recipients, are in the open. If you got your coins in an exchange that enforces KYC-AML, then the police can ask (with a warrant) them about the owner of that address. However, that is highly unlikely unless you get yourself into something you really shouldn't be doing.\n\nSome [very basic reading](https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know).",

Big organizations see what's coming. You don't invest in the now .., you invest in the future.

I.e., I wouldn't put all your saving into crypto unless its a small amount and you're young, but I can't stop you.\n  \nDollar cost average - put say 10% in per month and spread it out. Don't FOMO, you've got time.  Perhaps a couple alts wouldn't hurt just from a diversification standpoint, but BTC is the most conservative and probably safest, so I would focus there.  \n  \nAs far as timing is concerned - it's a fools errand to try and time the market (let alone time it perfectly).  I think prices are reasonable for someone looking to get in now, but they may be better over the next few months and into early next year.

Just set a pin and answers security questions and you're good.\n\nSo, they can trace the exchange from my brd wallet but are you sure than can see where it came from at first?\n\nBut do you think they could identify me only because I purchased the app from a source I'm logged in (play store)?

A lot of news events are excuses or reasons for a directional move. An ETF would bring more money to the space but a denial doesn't really change anything compared to today. However as we have seen. People are looking for an excuse to sell this year. I'm not sure if it's just a lot of people who bought in early wanting to get out that missed last year or what the deal is but we are at the end of this massive descending wedge that we have drawn out all year. We're either going higher or breaking support before the end of October. My question was just what the excuse will be for it. I suspect the ETF will probably be it",

Tether is eating up Bitcoin volume and this conspiracy can\u2019t go on forever. I don\u2019t think it makes it past end of Dec. 2019. It will get exposed in 2019 after more HODLers want to cash sorta like the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. Tether and Ponzi are synonymous. Tether will be responsible for Bitcoin\u2019s fatal fall down to high $2K/low $3K. This is the big elephant in the room that everyone continues to ignore. Everyone is hating on Goldman Sachs lately as if they have anything to do with Bitcoin\u2019s fall, but people will unleash their real rage and hatred when Tether explodes as the fraud that it is.",

One I noticed earlier this morning was between Post Oak Motors (Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Bugatti) and Bitpay, to start accepting Bitcoin payment for luxury vehicles. I also saw a headline announcing some ATM Maker partnering with Cannabis Dispensaries to enable payment solutions. You can find this stuff everywhere, but as for investing in the stocks for these companies, I've found that associating with blockchain and actually implementing blockchain are two very different beasts. Simply associating can cause a very temporary price hike in shares that is short lived. This is where Bitcoin got wrongly compared to the dot com bubble, but it was in fact bad actors with blockchain associations that shared the characteristics of the dot com era.\n\nAfter my experience with the 2008 market correction I have been putting my faith in the long game opportunity stocks, so I may not be the best person to offer any stock market info lol. As for crypto partnerships, just do the research - there are plenty of opportunities out there!",

They were floating the idea but there have never been any solid plans. That however became something to point that for the recent sell-off. \n\nThe real question is basically how many people who got in on the ground floor that have large Holdings want to just get out?

            "Text": "Unix and Linux are excellent examples, because like Bitcoin, they involve open source code contribution. The number of coders contributing to Bitcoin have tripped in just the past year alone. There is almost 0 chance of Bitcoin being replaced - it will simply be improved and layered for years to come. Yes nothing is definite but a hell of a lot would have to change in terms of the path Bitcoin is on. Plus, any other crypto would need 5-10 years just to catch up in terms of proving it has the foundation of a solid, stable and secure network tested under load to be worth building on. None of this is really being questioned anymore. It's just that many still judge Bitcoin on the price swings, when this has little to do with the bigger picture of what Bitcoin will become as we advance toward the future.",

            "Text": "Cryptogrip you\u2019re delusional. Tether is the modern day Mt. Gox and we saw Mt. Gox did to Bitcoin...it led to 4 very stale years and lots of mistrust and concern regarding Bitcoin. BTC might be $100K today had it not been for Mt. Gox\u2019s fallout. Mt. Gox is entirely responsible for the 2013 crash where BTC fell from $1100 in 2013 down to $175 in 2015. Yet, you are not learning from history and disregarding Tether which is the prop that continues to hold BTC from collapse. Once Tether goes, BTC will hard and it will simultaneously take Bitcoin a good 4-5 years to recover. Fool cryptogrip once, shame on you. Fool cryptogrip twice, shame on cryptogrip.",
