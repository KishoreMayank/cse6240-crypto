            "Text": "We are at knocking on the door of a bad bitch [here.](https://imgur.com/SbQ8B6u) \n\nShe kept us warm on the cold night when 20k wasn't having it. She was there for us when 16k kicked us out, she's the one who kept us from falling. When 17k gave us the boot, she gave us a warm place to put our range inside of her for weeks. But ultimately, she could not take any more of our shit, and had to let us go on Feb 1st. That stung. FUD was spoken, and feelings were hurt. And boy did we go downhill from there.....\n\nIt took us hitting rock bottom, waking up in 6k's dirty bed of despair, with FUD on our face, smelling like broken dreams, regret, and bear shit, to finally take a look in the mirror and say \"I've had enough, and I refuse to sink. I am good enough, I have real value, and dog gone it, HODLERS LIKE ME.\" \n\nWe pulled ourselves up, took a shower, got a clean shave and a slick haircut and started walking back up that long road. And yes, at one point, we did turn back. When everyone is telling you, \"you'll never make it, turn around while you still can, your transactions are too slow, your blocks are too small,\" it's hard to not discouraged. But after a couple nights sleeping in the bear-infested woods with the weak hands and the flippeners, we got it back together and continued on. \n\n[And here we are](https://imgur.com/tOOMXpX), 2 weeks later, back at *her* door, the day *after* St. Valentine's day, begging for a place to put our price range while we get on our feet again. She doesn't have to let us in right away, she will likely resist our advances, or she could slam that door right in our face and walk away. And if she does we will just have to hang around somewhere between here and 9k, fending off bears and fudsters, until we build up the confidence and support to try again. But we won't give up. We know our future is bright and our destiny is so much bigger than her and her halfway house. We are the ALPHA COIN. And if necessary we will kick in the door. And in the future, after we come and gone, she'll be proud that she had us inside her so many times before we blew up. \n\n",

It seems that many here have short memories and we need to keep ourselves grounded.  \n\nRemember - we have had 4 crashes in the last 2+ months.  We have also not yet recovered fully from last crash ($11,750 down to $6,187).  \n\nSo trade carefully - don't get swayed by many who are overly bullish and there is no shame in taking profit if you ahead.  We are at a point where another crash or a spike are both likely to happen.\n\nStay safe.",

They say that if you own 51% of the hashing power, you can fork off and mine at a faster rate your own \"private chain\" which will eventually exceed the length of the main chain, thereby rendering all the transactions in the previous chain unconfirmed. My question is that as a miner, can you actually select which block height to start mining on?? I thought that you had to start mining on the last block. Any help would be really appreciated! ",

At 10K you will hear \"oh, F- I'm late!\" bouncing off the ionosphere like an ad-hoc ham radio.  People will start jumping in (forgetting they missed out on buying at 6,7,8,9k) and finally, finally more worried that they are about to miss the Good Ship Lollipop to 20K.  The really worrisome musical chairs game will take place in the 17-20K range as the music slows and people slowly start positioning themselves near the exits like those two guys in Dunkirk.",

Thousands of new investors throwing $100-$1000+ at Bitcoin creates a very powerful domino-effect upward movement that gains momentum. It's a difficult movement to stop until the price reaches a profit taking point. We saw this in December, and nobody truly knows how high it will go this time. Advising people to not buy may leave them having to buy at a higher price. I realize it's all guessing but I just wanted to contribute to the point!",

The media desperately needs a way to explain when markets rally or sell off so they try to tie it to news events, but in reality it is a lot more complex than that. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a single event that caused the end of the rally to $20k. More likely the market was way overbought and needed to take a breather. \n\nSame thing at the bottom at $6k (if it is in fact the bottom). It wasn\u2019t the US senate hearing about crypto that caused the dip to stop. It was that sellers were exhausted. ",

Bitcoin is first out of the gate, considered the catalyst for blockchain's popularity.\n\nI could go on but I think this establishes the point?",

            "Text": "Percentage wise bitcoin went up a lot more than most dot com stocks during the tech bubble.\n\nComparing the market caps of cryptos vs Google is interesting as both technologies are transformative. When Google went public in 2004 it already had the largest market share in search engines, had only a 23 billion market cap, and many on the Street considered the IPO to be overpriced.  It took 19 years for Google/Alphabet to have 750 billion market cap. Bitcoin has only been around for 9 yrs, altcoins a lot shorter.\n\nGoogle has far more users than the entire crypto space put together, even if you only count the search engine and youtube. Long term I'm bullish on blockchain technology, but cryptos having 2/3rd of Google's current market cap is frankly ridiculous and indicative of a massive bubble and prices running way ahead of fundamentals.\n\nThe sentiment here is very similar to Apr-Sep 2000.  It was Yahoo stock message boards back then.  Money on the sidelines who missed prior year's exponential bull run came in to buy \"the dip\".  FOMO was in the air and sentiment was pretty bullish.  The NASDAQ rebounded 40% during this period from the Mar 2000 crash.  Then the 2nd wave of the bear market hit and dot coms went down another 85-99%.\n\nShort-term traders who bottom fished tech stocks and took profits quickly did fine, as long as they had the discipline to cut losses immediately when key support levels were broken in Oct 2000. Buy-and-hold bulls who believed in the long-term potential of the internet and bought half way down the Himalayas lost their shirts when the full mountain-shaped mean reversion completed.\n\nFor some perspective: a year ago BTC's price was $1050\nWhat was the technological breakthrough that justifies a 10x rise in price?",

But it is a curious value judgment on the part of credit card companies to restrict what sorts of lawful purchases you can make.  I tend to believe they are upset about the inevitable outflows of capital that, long term, will have nothing to do with them.  Crypto currency shrinks the pie of the world in which they operate.  Prove me wrong - is there any credit institution that would accept crypto currency to payoff your credit card?  This is, to me, like old cell phone providers that wanted to lock you into 2 year contracts (whoops, that sales model is gone) or cable companies that made you buy 200 channels to get the 5 you actually watch (whoops, internet TV is in the process of destroying that business model).  Crypto is a competing business model for which they are unprepared.  And they are pissing their pants over it.  (But yes, for the time being, the crypto world is really way too volatile).",

There isn't enough demand at $10k to fill all of those limit sells, so the price rebounds off of it.  Once that sell wall is \"eaten away\" by people wanting to buy, then there is often not much resistance to the next round number.  Look out for this next time we approach a round number, it's kind of cool.  Then once we cross a round number threshold, you may blow past it temporarily as the resistance breaks.",

FUN is a blockchain technology platform; they provide the games and the servers and all of the other barriers to entry most online casinos might have.  They then leverage the tech to provide provably fair games.  All casinos using the FUN platform will have to use FUN as the token. \n\nOf course, it could and probably will fail, but it's my moonshot token.  I think it'll either be worthless or revolutionize the industry and shoot up to a few dollars per coin.",

I then go to GDAX and use their transfer feature to pull it from Coinbase side to the GDAX exchange side. I day trade so if I want to sell BTC I sell it under the LIMIT (not MARKET) sell. Research Taker vs. Maker. If you place an immediate buy or sell at the market price you pay tx fees. If you use Limit, you do not. Say if you want to sell at $1000, use Limit and sell it at 1000.02 and you pay no tx fee. When I'm up a K, I then transfer it from my USD account on GDAX back to my bank account. I use a cc because I get points :)",
