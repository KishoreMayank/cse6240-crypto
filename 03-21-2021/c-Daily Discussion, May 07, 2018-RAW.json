Like countless others I use it for buying on Newegg and Overstock, I trade it regularly for investing in other assets, and firmly believe in it\u2019s potential. Am I therefore entitled to be insulted by someone who invested in companies like Monsanto or Procter&Gamble? How do you call activity like investing in companies who have no sense of moral or ethical values?",

I think it would be naive to think someone with a balance of 50,000 coins won't realise their profit at some stage. How many of these people are there? Sure, if these people are well intentioned and are aware of the damage they could cause then it doesn't need to be a problem. Coins can be dripped into the market, or sold OTC. \nBut there is still a massive imbalance in the distribution and I can see it being a problem sooner or later. I actually think this issue could be the eventual downfall of Bitcoin and a more fairly distributed coin could replace it as the standard. ",
