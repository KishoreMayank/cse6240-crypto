I'll sell you 100Million 4VC for a bargain; I can't believe I'm even offering this; but I'll give you 100Million 4VC for 10 Bitcoin. Obviously with Bitcoin being finite and 4VC being infinite you can understand that the value of 4VC is infinitely greater than BTC.\n\nAnyways I hope you consider this offer; the 4VC chain is really the best chain there is; capable of scaling to the whole world; and it doesn't use hardly any electricity; so its green friendly too.\n\n",

Also, people don't like change. 95% of the people around me talk crypto down and they have no clue what it's even about.  When I first heard of BTC (June of 2017) I thought \"oh that's too expensive (not knowing about satoshi's) let me look for the cheaper Crypto that maybe will be the next big thing\" and bought ETH instead. Now I understand it a \"little better\" and how BTC is different from all other cryptos.  Its just going to take some time.  A lot of time, money and effort is still being put into this, to make it user-friendly.  All these wallets coming out are still being tweaked to make it that way.  It's not a matter of \"if\" its \"when\". Congrats to all of those that got in at the beginning.     ",

Bitcoin is exactly what the fiat you love so much is, except that it's global, anonymous if you use it the right way, impervious to fraud (you cannot create fake coins or transactions), cannot be seized by anyone and has known supply rate and maximum supply. Bitcoin solves real world problems, problems that nothing else solves, so although it is a currency, it's also more than a currency. And because of that, it has an inherent value. Because it is not widely used as a currency by the average person presently, people who buy it buy it because they believe it will one day become that. Those who have sold it after buying it high are just randoms who like to follow trends. They don't belong in this community of early supporters.",
