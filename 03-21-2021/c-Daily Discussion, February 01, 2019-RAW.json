A CBOE spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the decision to withdraw its request was the result of the U.S. government shutdown as the end of the review period approached. Some legal experts noted at the time that the SEC was operating on a limited basis due the shutdown, which was the result of a political impasse over a proposed wall on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>ETFs are securities that track a basket of assets proportionately represented in the fund\u2019s shares. They are seen by some as a potential step forward for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a regulated and passive investment instrument.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: Cointelegraph ",

People like the concept of bitcoin, and it's clear after this past decade that a growing number of people want to own some bitcoin. But ... most people are fine with paying for the services that banks provide. They like that assurance that if something happens to their money, the banks have their back. So while many of us here in these forums like the idea of controlling our money and being responsible for our keys, the reality is that most people are not comfortable with this. That is why bakkt, Fidelity and many more businesses will make a killing over the years to come. That is also why banks will most likely not be made irrelevant. How would a bitcoin bank work? They will provide hassle free cold storage with insurance that your wealth in bitcoin will be covered in the event of a loss, theft, hack etc.... for a fee.",

You don't get why a peer to peer currency network that self maintains with perfect accurancy offers value above some common collectable? You sound like you were brainwashed by some old school accountant who shouts at bitcoin the way he shouts at kids to get off his lawn. You and I can talk about this, but our opinions don't change the fact that it's happening. Let's see Fidelity or the owners of the New York Stock Exchange put their reputation on the line for pokemon cards. And for god sakes stop talking about making millionaires. Even with the insane gains from 2017, I still never made millions. This is not about making millionaires it's about building the future.",

People trust them with their wealth, and you don't make moves to publicly support something that's a fad or a scam in that position. Besides, if promoting a bitcoin platform gives them free advertising, they must feel there is a lot of interest in bitcoin, so that just reinforces what I'm saying. Of course bitcoin is the future, and it's following the path of almost every technology we've seen over the past century. Bitcoin has already created more jobs than the US government - let's see pokemon cards do that. \nBy the way, why in the hell would the NYSE need more advertising or exposure??
