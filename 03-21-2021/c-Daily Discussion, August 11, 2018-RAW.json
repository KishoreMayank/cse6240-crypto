And it is not just a trite curiosity.\n\nNow the market is on a fragile balance; for the further development of cryptocurrency, we need to know who created crypto and why. Was it really an enthusiast who gave the world an independent currency or was it a group of people pursuing scientific or purely selfish purposes? Or perhaps Bitcoin is an invention of a large company or a IT giant that decided to take a new direction? Can Bitcoin be the state invention, created with the purpose to control all transactions? There are many assumptions as to who might be behind this, but neither theory has been confirmed.",

Anybody can learn how it works, and then try to make predictions for how it will influence the world. Satoshi is still a human, and has no better ability to predict the future than you do. Even if his intentions are entirely altruistic in creating BTC, that wouldn't prevent the rest of the world from misusing his invention. The reverse also holds true.\n\nBTC fans tend to hold him up as some savior type figure, who somehow saw that his creation could save humanity. But in reality, he is just a programmer and cryptographer who solved a problem(double spends) in computer science that allowed the creation of a distributed currency with no single owner or point of failure.",

I'm hoping the price goes up, but Im shorting when the indicator turns red and longing when it turns green. I'm in cash now, and when we start going up I will buy bitcoin so that appreciates as well. I'm pulling about 25% out a week and still maintaining a min. balance.",
