They are happy today). I have never once felt negative about this incredible opportunity. The only negative people are those who started out a year or so ago. I've heard all the same shit from all the same kind of people and every single time people go from gloom and doom to giddy little bi-polar fuckers. The next run up will be insane, mark my words. Don't get me wrong... we need people to be all afraid, we need people to question the space and fearful, we need conspiracy theories about tether... We need it to create the risk reward balance that creates the craziness of it all. Otherwise everything would be a bubble and the space would not be what it has become for anyone that can look past a one year window.\"\n\n",

Adoption, might, I guess? But again, nobody is using it... even shops and restaurants on those \"bitcoin accepted here\" directories have stopped accepting it, either because it was a huge pain to deal with, or nobody actually paid with BTC so they just kinda forgot about it. \n\nBitcoin needs a killer app that makes people think, OF COURSE! This is so obvious. Why did I ever do it the other way?\n\nYou can't talk about decentralization, being your own bank, the evils of inflation to normal people and expect them to care what you're saying. If you have to prime your mark with a dozen articles and youtube videos before they \"get it\", then it's never going to go anywhere.\n\nRight now bitcoin is kinda useless aside from speculation. Payments are way easier using something like Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc. and there are approximately zero shops or businesses actually accepting it (even the \"Bitcoin Cafe\" rofl).\n\nIn my view, the only thing that will increase BTC price now is: 1. Tether induced manipulation, or 2. another massive bull run that eclipses the 20k high... adding another layer of bag hodlers to the bottom of the pyramid. \n\nIf 1. starts to happen, it could trigger 2.

            "Text": "I've watched Bitcoin go from pennies to thousands ( no, I didn't buy at pennies, but I know people who mined it then. They are happy today). I have never once felt negative about this incredible opportunity. The only negative people are those who started out a year or so ago. I've heard all the same shit from all the same kind of people and every single time people go from gloom and doom to giddy little bi-polar fuckers. The next run up will be insane, mark my words.\nDon't get me wrong... we need people to be all afraid, we need people to question the space and be fearful, we need conspiracy theories about tether... We need all this to create the risk reward balance that creates the craziness of it all. Otherwise everything would be a bubble and the space would not be what it has become for anyone that can look past a one year window.\nWe also need people to criticize the speed, demand more from the technology. That's why the coding community for Bitcoin and crytpo has tripled in size in such a short time. It's up to you which side of it all you want to be on. Either way, just know that your negativity will not stop the insane growth of the crypto space.",

            "Text": "I see your point - however - I see apps like Apple Pay, Venmo, etc. using digital money (USD) taking over rather than cryptocurrencies. The EU already has SEPA which makes transactions between bank accounts nearly instant. Online-only bank accounts are becoming more popular (like Ally).\n\nBitcoin has the problem of, at heart, being a deflationary currency which means that for mass adoption we need a MAJOR change to how the world economy works. Can you see consumerism dying? People hodling their coins while spending money only on what they TRULY need? Eh - maybe - but I doubt it.\n\nOptimizing existing systems has the huge advantage of working within the framework our economy is built on. I mean, what, we'd need to abolish the federal reserve? Make banks obsolete? How's this going to affect the stock market? My guess is people aren't going to throw their money into stocks when they can see better returns just hodling. The U.S. tech sector alone has generated an obscene amount of wealth, is this now going to shift over to China?\n\nAnyway - my point is - this would require a MAJOR shift that has very very very limited appeal outside of certain ancap and libertarian circles. Realistically it's not going to gain traction.",

Bitcoin can serve people in many ways that distinguish it from digital fiat or physical metals.  Namely, if you're afraid of a debt or currency crisis in your country, you might want to store some of your wealth in an asset like bitcoin.  If you want to protect your wealth from inflation while taking advantage of multisignature capabilities and without reliance on a custodian, you might want an asset like bitcoin.  If you want a noncorrelated asset to diversify your QE-inflated portfolio, you might consider an asset like bitcoin.\n\nDigital fiat can be useful, but I'm not going to hold any significant value on Venmo for any length of time.

Of course there's volatility and a predictable bear market after a multi-year 100x bull.    \n\nPosition sizing mitigates the impact of the bear markets.  0.1 - 5% BTC in one's portfolio depending on risk tolerance is reasonable  for most people.  A Turk with 5% BTC, 10% gold, 10% USD, and 75% Lira would have less risk/volatility than one who's 100% Lira.\n\nIt's all about diversification.",

That was the previous high that had to be broken 5 years ago, and the network has advanced significantly since then: ubiquitous hardware wallets, institutional custody, futures, potential ETF, not to mention the entire crypto space around Bitcoin.  Its fair value is much greater now than it was then.  That's my opinion at least.\n\nWould you buy it if it reached your $100-500 target?\n\n",

            "Text": "Fair enough.  We'll see.  I think Tether is more of a meme than institutional investors.  I've spoken with some institutional crypto investors...there are definitely hedge funds focused on the space.  I'm not sure how much they're raising and I certainly don't think it will be a widespread institutional holding overnight, but it doesn't take much to move the needle.  \n\nI think Tether concerns are overblown.  If Tether were printing more USDT than the market demanded, the price wouldn't be pegged as well as it is.  But maybe it'll blow up some day - if so, good riddance.  BTC dominance would likely go through the roof.\n\nI think we'll have a bitcoin ETF within 18 months regardless of what happens (or doesn't happen) to Tether.   But I guess we'll see how it plays out.",
