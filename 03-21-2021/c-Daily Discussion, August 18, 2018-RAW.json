We had a closing of almost +4% yesterday so a correction was expected, the important part is that said correction doesn't put us lower than the opening yesterday, and so far it hasn't. We are still up from from our lowest point this month and up from our lowest point in the year. Remember that climbing a mountain isn't a straight shot up, there are ups and downs. We will have to see some red before seeing some green again.\n\nThe organic grow everyone was talking about happens on the long run, meanwhile we can expect to see crazy things happening like yesterday and crazy things happening like today. Remember that this low happened on a weekend, where the price basically falls in the hands of some bots and algorithms, so drops like this or worse are to be expected.\n\nTL;DR: Chill, we are good.",

I think we are close to the floor and may have already hit it on June 24, 2018 when price was $ 5,826.41. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you look at the chart of bitcoin over the past few years you can clearly see the long term trend upwards.  Note the linear regression channel.  We are currently in the lower end of the regression band.  Every time the price goes below $6,000 there is strong buying pressure which sends it quickly back above $6k.  I think the bull market of 2017 has minted a lot of new hardcore HODLers who are continuously accumulating.  Combined with the barebones cost of mining, we are seeing a floor that gradually rises. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/chart/eJH0ldkN/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow let\u2019s begin our journey back to late 2015 as the market just started to show glimpses of recovery:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n\nKatie Elizabeth Charm had this to say on October 25, 2015:\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/wjT9Wux\n\n\u2014-\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMood was becoming more optimistic again after almost 2 years of pain:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n\nu/phanpp - 2y\n\n28 October 2015 bitcoin reached $300 after a long long hiatus. Boy did I cheer then. $400 now - Ho Hum. Maybe worth cheering again at $600. No, make that $1000\n\n&nbsp;\n\nu/phanpp\u2022 2y\nJust my way of saying that bitcoin is a success and if you just hold the price will keep going up - nothing magical\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3vz9bt/28_october_2015_bitcoin_reached_300_after_a_long/\n\n\u2014-\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome historical perspective:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n&nbsp;\n\nThe truly defining Post-MtGox moments when Bitcoin turned from Bearish to Bullish\n\n&nbsp;\n\nu/Post-Cosmic\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5wiblt/the_truly_defining_postmtgox_moments_when_bitcoin/\n\n\u2014-\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis will be true again:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n\nBitcoin: The Rise and Fall or There and Back Again\n\n&nbsp;\n\nu/Dickinson-Junior\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd, as analysts has predicted, Bitcoin will easily take the next milestone \u2014 $10,000 \u2014 at the end of this year or in the beginning of the next one! So, no matter how jerky Bitcoin is a lot of people would like to take a bite out of its crypto-yumminess! Those who have passed on that treat will bite their nails later.

I\u2019m also toying with an extremely simple linear model that just looks at the organic growth 2015 to 2016, without factoring in the new buyers/hodlers since 2017  (parabolic growth period). This growth trend approximately models a doubling in price every year. \n\nSo if 2017 never happened we\u2019d be around a $3,500 floor, minimum, by this fall.  Since we have obviously acquired a lot of new buyers accumulating since 2017, the floor has to be significantly higher.  5.8k floor seems conservative. ",

This is another year of massive progress despite your shallow perspective and ignorance of how this shit is integrating with the fabric of society. The coin price will catch up, whether you shout at bitcoin like an old senile man or not. When it does....again just like it always has, you will squirm away in the shadows and not let anyone tell you how wrong you were. Just watch...you'll be nowhere to be found once BTC is over 30k.",

At some point, regulators will step in, price will collapse and we will know then what the market is really prepared to pay.\n\nMoney?  First, I'm pretty confident that my stash is much bigger than yours.  And my current short is 2.4x since 15k.  I will cash in my short when it crash and will be super happy if it goes to 30k after that.  Either way, I win, which is why I kept telling you that the price does not bother me.",
