Is this a good thing? \n\nI've run a bunch of surveys on these groups, asking if they knew what they were doing - like do they know what the roles of the miner is on the network etc and its a pretty clear no, the majority has no idea what they are doing. \n\nIs it too small and insignificant thing to be worried about?

If each time I'm opening a channel, the system has to write it in the main blockchain, how's this different than paying as a single nowadays btc transaction?\n\nI get that if I'm connected and opened a channel, I'm able to pay with very small amounts of fee and almost instantly.

At least that's how I understand the process.  The idea is that you might get 50 micro payments to your LN channel and then you may want to close it to send to cold storage. As far as I know there is no real time limit to keeping a channel open. ",

            "Text": "Channels persist as long as neither party closes them (even if *both* parties go offline). Remaining online is only necessary if you receive funds through a channel as you will need to be online to accept the payment in the channel and you will need to be online to monitor the blockchain for the other party trying to cheat you.\n\nIf you only spend through lightning (as 95% of mobile wallet users will) then you can't be cheated as you haven't ever signed an earlier transaction that would lower your payout from the channel balance if it was broadcasted, so there is no opportunity to cheat you. If you do want to receive funds you can still remain offline (apart from momentarily when receiving the payment) and simply employ a Watchtower 'delegate' to scan the blockchain on your behalf to prevent cheating from the other party.",

You need to keep at least some small amount of bitcoin in it. Otherwise there would be no way for your channel partner to penalise you should you try and cheat by publishing a balance that isn't the latest one.

Free money is much better when you're just given it. \n\nI guess my question is should we push for more education for miners? I see miners kind of like farmers I guess and that yeah, anyone can just buy a chicken and get free eggs or buy more chickens and sell some eggs, but with some basic farming knowledge you could grow much better chickens .... I think that analogy was a bad one. \n\nAnyway, I kind of see miners like what old time farmers were like, there were lots of then that provides a great service, and over time there were less, but we still kinda need them. \n\nMining IS worth the money, IF the circumstances are right ( electricity, price of parts, assuming coins still use POW etc ) but is it also worth trying to educate miners and does it matter either way, because I think with a little education they could be better miners...maybe.

But you will pay out the ass on your rate. They have to make money somehow, and if they cannot sell your loan (because you have documentation outside fannie and Freddie guidelines) then they will make their money on the increased rate.
