For a long time, the monetary authority of the state was necessary to establish ubiquitous value systems that enabled efficient trade. 2009 marked the invention of a commodity with intrinsically valuable characteristics (divisibility, verifiable scarcity, ease of transfer, openness) that will push extrinsic characteristics (network effects) and the benefits (stability, liquidity, value storage) to take hold given time. As superpowers continue to wield their monetary weapons (USA/China) at the expense of less powerful nations, self-interest will drive individuals and eventually those nations to adopt Cryptocurrencies (most likely one) as the standard for value.\n\n2009 marked the beginning of the revolution. What we will see 100 years from now as the natural evolution of money, today seems radical. What does a world look like where fiat regimes are reigned in and every man, woman, and entity is held accountable for its fiscal deeds? Most people use simplistic mental models framed by the structure of their world today to assess the likelihood of events in the future and as a result, they miss the first principles that are driving Bitcoin\u2019s story.\n\nDon\u2019t let price day-to-day make you forget what is already set in motion. We are privileged to be apart of such an important moment in the human story.",

Buy only from trusted seller (best is the manufacturer)! If it happens You buy one second hand the first step should be making a complete factory reset/clearing everything from the device and a firmware update first, but it still might be hacked by hardware.\n\nI can not tell much about Ledger, but Trezor works fine, never experienced any problem, or have seen people complain about it.",

I like to see btc hit 150k too, but the time isn't there yet. besides, when btc attempts to break out the selling pressure increases dramatically. \n\nThat's why all of the last \"break-outs\" were never higer then c.a. 10%/15%. Us, retail investors can't compete with the sell pressure anymore, unless a price rise is orchestrated. At this moment the price is more likely to drop in order to bottom out, then to rise. You can downvote me for being honest.\n\nBut I guess we will see the upcoming days :) ",

Not all fiat currencies even remotely fit the academic definition of \u201cmoney\u201d. It\u2019s a continuum and if at the margin people are moving towards something as money rather than away relative to other mediums as money, then eventually it will be widespread. The classical definition of money comes after maturation, not before.\n\nI think the intrinsic characteristics of non-sovereign money are attractive and in some cases necessary for people around the world. Because bitcoin has liquid markets and some merchants accept it as payment, it is along the continuum of a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. Hell, bread is on that continuum as well. However, I think it\u2019s intrinsic characteristics give it a great chance (compared to something like bread) to mature into \u201cthe\u201d store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. \n\nHowever, this new money will be instituted by the people rather than a sovereign entity.
