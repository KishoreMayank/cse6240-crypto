            "Text": "just in case anyone is wondering whats happening.\nthe current price is almost 95% correlated with the amount of BTC shorted on bitfinex. you can check for yourself - anytime somebody shorts, the price goes down and if some whale closes his position we see those huge spikes. check the charts for yourself. and by the way - today we've reached the highest amount of BTC shorted since over half a year. If all those were to close their positions we would probably rally to over 10k again very easy. \nhttps://imgur.com/9TntVnS\nThere's two possibilities here imo: people buy back in and liquidate the shorters REALLY bad (as happening in september last year when we bounced from 3k -> the following 5k-7k movements were almost all shorts who bought back in at a loss - check the charts) or the shorters manage to scare more people into selling into their shorts so they can buy back at a profit and then rebuy for good. yet the low volume selling indicates there are simply not enough people to panic sell anymore which may catch the bears off guard.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/9TntVnS\n\nthats just what im seeing tho. im super interested in how this turns out - the amount of short positions open we are seeing now is very new land and exciting to watch",

The graph says it all. 4 months and the price has slid down one dip after another, a clear indication that the price is only going to lower at this point. No person with the right mind would think that buying bitcoins after crashing down hard *even* at 67% below the ATH is a good idea. How long has it been since Bitcoins were around? Pretty much forever at this point. So why are people STILL losing hope in a system that many people *think*, will dominate the world? Please PLEASE tell me I'm not crazy for thinking this. \n\nI am going to pass on the opportunity to buy and will steer clear for the sake of common sense - which is unfortunately a dying trait nowadays. No amount of reasoning will lead me to the surge of upvotes in this circlejerk sub although I am confident that I will be ultimately be right about this which is why I am taking my sweet time before bed to post this message and be able to look back with pride when the time comes. \n\nIf not, then sweet. I will relish the second chance to sell what's left of my bitcoin stash before I make the same mistake twice - yes you heard me, I am an official bitcoin owner who's NOT too optimistic about the future of bitcoin. I'll be happy to risk what's left of my portfolio and hope that I'm wrong over blindly believing that this predicament is going to change for the better. ",

The listing, however, stipulates that seller will accept bitcoin as payment based upon a \"non-negotiable\" sale price of $2.3 million.\n\nFar from Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, the listing in Middletown, often ranked one of the best places (MONEY Magazine Names Middletown One of Best Places to Live in Northeast Region) to live in the US, shows just how far cryptocurrency and bitcoin have reached into the national conversation.\n\nThe listing is far from the only one in the\n\nUS\n\nto accept bitcoin.\n\nOver the last six months, an increasing number of real estate listings have begun accepting or requesting cryptocurrency for payment. There have even been some that only accept bitcoin as payment.\n\nBitcoin Real Estate, a website specializing in real estate listings that accept cryptocurrency, told Mercury News in late January that it has nearly 400 homes listed on its website.\n\nReal estate website Trulia told Mashable last week that it had around 80 listings that mentioned cryptocurrency in some way, while Redfin said it had seen the number of listings accepting cryptocurrency rise from 75 in December to 134 in January.",

            "Text": "I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.\n\nThe market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.\n\nWhile sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. \n\nJust my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.",

If they  start a price climb they profit or if it starts downward they can control selling and sell everything before price reaches when they entered position. Only way to lose if same size large capital is playing against you but that is not in anyone interest. So everyone pays attention and when big money comes in everyone including small traders jump the ship trying to push the price as much as they can before shorting it again.  ",

He said it in november he was certain they would free fall. thats like a big red warning flag to everyone. I sold everything i was done. When he says word certain its once in blue moon and he has never been wrong when he used that word. He usually just says he doesn't understand it so he dont invest in it. You guys said hes a dumb old man. He knows one thing that any sort of investment will be taxed by the government. Now everyone is facing heavy fines from the irs that either turned crypto into fiat or traded crypto for crypto. These coins are not decentralized. Maybe ecosystem might be some day but the coins themselves are not. The irs wil come kknocking at your door if your not paying taxes on your profits. Wtih all this regulation coming in crypto investing is over with. Its game over. The ecosystem have a bright future i love the crypto technology but these coins were not made for investing purposes. They were made to fund these ecosystems to get going. Its in the white paper. I am pretty sure bitcoin will be under 1k by end of the year. Nobody wants to deal with the irs in the usa. I wont touch crypto with a 10 foot pole. I know several people who faced heavy tax fines. No ty. So if your investing be careful. It could turn around but I don't see it happening when irs is coming after people. If u have to invest into it pyramid slowly into it as it goes down. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. I loved crypto investing too i get it but I am not taking on the irs and fincen they are the end bosses that i never want to have problems with. ",

Although i have bids at 3kish i have them a lot lower also. Bitcoin isn't going away its just getting played like a violin right now.\n\nOnly time will tell. Bitcoin has often done what everyone expected and just as often went out of its way causing people to get burned and fomo back in. I'd buy in at a price im comfortable with holding through the worst expected outcome but at the same time having the chance for better gains if it does the opposite",

            "Text": "Aye, the Greeks of that time are all dead by now, but their deeds are alive, especially the deeds of the bravest who died at Thermopylae.\n\nThe Greeks had evacuated Athens by the time the armies of Xerxes approached. The battle of Thermopylae was lost, with even more severe losses for the Persians. Xerxes' naval armada was then crushed at Salamis and he was forced to retreat with his starved armies without his desired spoils. Athens survived and grew in power. The brave warriors that died were heroes for centuries.\n\nNo relation to bitcoin whatsoever, it just didn't end the way you imagined. The Spartans valued bravery, fame and battle over life itself. Since all men die, they sought to leave the world with impact. And they did. They certainly didn't die impotent from old age and ill health. They were not remembered for going silent into the night.",

If you combine a congregate of factors and trends then you get a complex picture of potential outcomes, both upwards and downwards.\n\nThe further down the price goes, the stronger the buying pressure becomes since traders will consider the price increasingly undervalued below certain ranges. That's why it's difficult to predict price drops below levels that are known, where we have observed strong bounces already, since the terrain below that bounce is uncharted in regards to the buying pressure.",

Thats not what crypto currencies was supposed to be about in the first place. It was to fund them so they can start their ecosystems. It wasn't to put money in your pocket. So if that is why you are here you should not be on here. Its not about you and your wallet its about the technology making it better for humanity and learning from the tech they are creating. Why i keep telling you all this was not made for investing. Its in their white paper. People are going broke thinking its like a stock.

He bought a business he had no idea how it worked he just talked to the ceo for 5m and bought it and it was huge success. He knows what a successful ceo does to structure his business in a successful way. Most people he turns down on investing in their business he looks for a certain quality in the person and how they structure their life around their business. That is how warren buffet looks at things is how the environment around it operates and he knows what environment will succeed and what will fail at a uncanny ability to become one of the richest in the world. He knows exactly what he is doing. People laughed at him about gold when gold went to 2k and they aren't laughing anymore his birkshire stock worth way more. They laughed at him about internet stocks and the .com bubble shut everyone up. Some hedge fund took his bet they could make more money then index fund they lost the bet. People have tried to prove him wrong but in the long run he is always right its why hes what 2nd richest in the world and these talkers are broke. If someone can grind out 50 billion dollars over a ton of years I would take his advice over anyone else. He doesn't need your money or to try to scam anyone he has no need for money. He doesn't have to give his wisdom out to anyone but he is trying to guide people properly on what made him successful. I don't get it someones old and young people assume they are stupid or have no clue about life. ",

            "Text": "Right. Then you have whales working together on the other spectrum, seeing benefit in pumping up the price, whose behavior will disrupt bear-traders and shorters, making them less confident and causing them to incur losses. Sure, the bullish whales are not saints, they will sell for profit later, either parts or all of it if they are not holders, but at the end of the day whales are not a uniform group with a particular agenda. Rational self interest can explain most trading behaviors.\n\nWhen people let conspiracies enter their thinking they start to panic sell, without basis in objective criteria, which may contribute to escalate a price fall which they oppose. Better to observe the market, be aware of risks, take precautions with long-term goals in sight and without stressing.",

A weak buying pressure contributes to the fall but it is the eagerness of the sellers, who are bidding below each other in order to sell, that causes the actual fall. The selling volumes also have to outperform the buying volumes.\n\nThe buying pressure increases the more undervalued the price is considered, at least below a particular point. This is what eventually stops the price from falling and results in a bounce. Though if we are considering particular assets that are not expected to recover properly, then it is not given that the buying pressure will increase much as the price drops, if there isn't enough confidence that the asset will recover and pay off within an expected timeframe.",

At 8k the price had fallen steadily since 9k without much resistance and the volumes were much, much lower than now with far less visible purchase power. Probably many traders wanted prices sub 7k levels and felt no reason to rebuy until it dropped deep enough. At this present point, I'd be more careful with taking risks. The bounces over 6.6k have been strong and happened in the blink of an eye, which is not the kind of signals I would appreciate if I wanted to sell or short.",
