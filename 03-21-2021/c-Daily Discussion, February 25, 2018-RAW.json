            "Text": "Bitcoin should be closer to $1000 to be honest. I will have to research further to find out why it got boosted to this level. The answers in that recent \"why did Bitcoin get to this price all of a sudden\" thread weren't very convincing. As far as my memory and sources allow, Bitcoin started a massive run after the Aug, 2017 hard fork. I can't think of any other factors except CNBC, MSNBC and CNN going on about it as well as the introduction of Bitcoin futures. I will have to view more foreign sources to gauge what the sentiment was back then. I just don't see any major catalyst last year that would have boosted Bitcoin from $900 to $20k. $10k is a stretch tbh. I feel like someone just has their funds sitting on the base layer and they are just siphoning off from each new buy and taking the fiat profit.\n\nWhat real catalysts do you guys remember from last year that was major to the point of moving BTC from $900 to $20,000? Don't give me that fear of missing out nonsense either. That only works in smaller percentages or amounts. People will see something gaining 20-30% and then they will say \"I better get in on this!\" When something is reaching astronomical levels they think \"oh, that's too high. I'm not sure if I will buy.\" Maybe that's just my thinking though because obviously people were buying at $20k so I don't know.",

            "Text": "Not really. Let's say you want to make a transaction worth $100 million. If Bitcoin is worth a dollar you can't. If it was $5 you'd need an entire supply of Bitcoin to make that transaction. If it's $500,000 you only need 200 BTC.   \n   \nNow I can't find a total volume of financial transactions worldwide, but for currency trading only it is over $5 trillion daily. Let's conservatively estimate that a total volume of all transactions is double that, i.e $10 trillion. For bitcoin to be able to be used in 5% of those transactions it's value would have to be at least   $500,000. And this doesn't even include its uility as store of value which could double this estimation.\n\nAnother thing to look at is the cost of mining a bitcoin. It currently costs around $6000 to mine one, which, with current price, makes it profitable for the miners. As the difficulty increases with time, the cost of mining the last bitcoin is going to be around $1 million.",

            "Text": "Good question. From my understanding, for a channel to open or for additional funds to be deposited into a channel, a transaction has to be completed on-chain. All of the funds entering have been broadcast and verified. To get out any funds, another transaction has to be broadcast and verified, while the transaction recorder on-chain will simply state the totals - however if something shady were to be able to happen between the two on-chain transactions, the final totals wouldn't match the funds that were previously deposited, broadcast, and verified, rejecting the entire transaction altogether. This way there in an inherent incentive to just NOT even try to double spend, even if it were possible, since the funds would just stay locked up in the channel. It is a layer 2 solution, not a parallel system, so everything that happens is dictated by the rules of layer 1. But I might have some details wrong, I am still a noob.",

My question is...how? \n\nI'm not a blockchain expert, but from what I understand the blockchain exists as a ledger of all transactions. This is how at one time you can check ANY address and see how much is in it. Will this be the same for LN?

Misbehaving inside the channel will result in the counterparty closing it, and you get 'refunded' whatever you had before in the last valid state.",

If you for example stepped in this week, you need new people stepping in next week to make profit. These new people need other people to step in, in order for them to make profit, et cetera etcetera. If there's a marketdip, like now, the people that stepped in at the end, loose. 2017 brought insane profits. So insane, you couldn't believe it looking at the chart. This will not go on forever, cause there's a point , and we might have already reached that point, that there won't be enough new people stepping in. Who's going to step into bitcoin in 2018? Nobody. ordinary people tried to step in in december last year, but they got burned and stepped out. The mass will never ever step in to bitcoin, it will always stay a nicheproduct. That means, at some point, the market/currency will bleed to death. The ones that stepped in early will see there's no growth, so they'll step out. There won't be enough new people to compensate for the old people stepping out. Only mass adoption from insitutions could avoid this problem, but everybody knows bitcoin will never be adopted as a payment method. The price is too high and the transaction costs way too high. \n\nSo, I can already predict the fact that bitcoin will bleed to death. \n\nThis is the unconvenient truth.  ",

And those who read the comment before it was deleted could assume there must have been some validity to it based on mods reaction.   \n   \nIt seems a much wiser policy would be to allow others vote on the comment and present counter arguments which could convince the poster to change their view and let the readers decide what to believe. That's how most of Reddit works anyway.   \n   \nBesides, there are tons of shitty troll comments which literally add nothing to discussion like \"We're going to $100\" and \"Bitcoin's dead\" left untouched, so it seems pretty inconsistent.",

            "Text": "To be fair, they're all technical debt at this point. The amount of crap we pile on top of HTTP to make it do things it was never meant to. TCP, too, both has tons of added-on stuff because it's always way easier than replacing it. And was not designed for intermittent traffic and silence like we use it for in many cases today (which is one of the reasons why FTP uses one TCP connection for control and seperate connections for the data transfer). QUIC is (slowly) replacing it.\n\nAs hard as replacing basic Internet infrastructure is, replacing a base layer that has real world currency value attached to it is much harder - just upgrading software is not enough.\n\nSo we'll keep improving Bitcoin until, 30 years from now, developers will be whining about how horrible all these layers of hacks are and how great it would be if it was designed The Right Way from the start, or if they could tear it down and rebuild it.\n\n",

(BTW, you can close a channel directly to someone on-chain that you're paying to).\n\nThen again I also heard him say you'll scan an invoice and your wallet will pay it without you having to know how.\n\nYou could set up trustless a LN-to-BTC gateway, using the same scripts as atomic swaps. But that requires the recipient to participate (as if you send an atomic swap to him - he'll need to accept a hash preimage to take the funds), or multiple transactions (in which case you might as well close a channel to pay and open a new one).\n\nThere are blockchains that don't exhibit this property - Monero has a ledger of all transactions, right? But you can't check an address and see how much there is in it.\n\nI think the blockchain's basic property is not storing transactions or proving the absence of them, but allowing to verify that a transaction is valid and confirming it. The blockchain verifies LN's opening and closing transactions, and inside the channel both peers agree on every state update. The only shady thing you can do inside the channel, that your peer will agree to, is to claim to have less funds than you do.",

Unfortunately it dipped more. I had previously bought in last at $11, 200, so I made a little gains on these smaller dips. I'm up now unless I sell.

Bitcoin or other funny money will not solve the fundamental problems of having a dysfunctional government and economy.   The other thing is that if you live in a place like Zimbabwe then getting bitcoins is already near impossible: can't afford a mining rig, don't have the forex to buy on an exchange, etc.    ",

            "Text": "'There are still a lot of hardcore Bitcoin users who use it for its intended purpose.'\n\nA small hardcore almost insignificant group. It doesn't matter anyway, what matters is, if you want to see the price rise, that new people come in. But let's see how long these people stay in when the price really drops. \n\n\n'There are so many use cases for cryptocurrencies in general. Sticking with BTC, I would say anyone who wants to use a digital currency that isn't directly controlled by a central body, or people in countries with an unworkable or problematic currency (Zimbabwe, India, etc.)'\n\nTrue, people in third world countries. But we all know how slow development goes in third world countries. Many people in these countries don't own a smartphone, have no access to internet, let alone knowing what a bitcoin is. By the time the thirld world countries step into bitcoin, the western world already stepped out, cause there won't be enough newcomers anymore. You need fresh blood to keep the price go up. But you can't go further after a certain point.\n\n'How is that different from any stock option, or a business that needs new customers to survive? A pyramid needs it's operators to recruit others to survive. That's like saying a lemonade stand is a pyramid scheme because it needs new customers to come and buy lemonade for it to survive.'\n\nBecause with a stock option, you own part of a company. So, when the company grows, you'll get dividend. The value of a stock isn't only based on speculation, but also on the performance of a company, that sells a real life service or product. So the price of a stock is partly justified by an underlying value. Bitcoin has no underlying value. The blockhain is outdated, it's not used as a currency. Then, you'll have people say: it's digital gold. Okay, that could be true, but part of the fact bitcoin is attractive is the huge gains people can make. These gains won't be made anymore if new people won't step in. And we already know that the mass consists of non-risktakers. The mass doesn't take risks, so they won't step in, but you need them, you need fresh blood to raise the price. You didn't need them in 2016 or 2015, but you need them now, cause everyone else has already stepped in: the geeks, the hardcore bitcoin supporters, the haters of the financial system, small traders, gamblers and all the others. So, we have approached the moment that the mass must step in. But the mass only steps in with low volatility. Low volatility is not attractive for the ones that already are in bitcoin. \n\nSo, maybe it will stay as digital gold, but the volatility will be way less than now, and thus the gains that could be made. \n\nAnyway, i hope I'm wrong. I stepped in too late, I'm too greedy to not step inj. But rationally, I think it's over. Maybe not with some new cryptos, but bitcoin needs fresh blood from the mass now, and it won't happen. But let's see in 3 months, maybe there will be a completely new dynamic. ",

This minimizes risk, and also maximizes profit for when it swings back up.\n\nWaiting hours will mean you're purchasing at either a plateau or when it's rising. A plateau is worse than a dip for flipping(if short-term).",

It was driven by people who are un-qualified to obtain mortgages flooding into the market for homes and that market was unable to grow with demand, hence valuations went up.   The only speculators were house flippers and they were not a significant overall factor.\n\nThe housing bubble was NOTHING like the the (Internet/Crypto/Tulip) bubble.  ",

If you bought at 20k, you were an idiot. If you bought anywhere from over 12k, you were an idiot. Bitcoin's true value is around 5k and it will never dip under it. \n\nBitcoin is extremely risky but extremely profitable. If you want to make a lot of money in a short amount of time, you must risk it. \n\nGo make another account, shill.",

            "Text": "I think the bigger point is that houses have an inherent value that is measurable. You can model the overall growth of a population, you can model the rate at which new properties are built, you can model  a stream of cash flows that you could get from renting out a property. There\u2019s a lot of information people can use to come up with a valuation. Because of this, it\u2019s unlikely that the market is going to ever overvalue properties by more than 100% or so. So when the bubble pops, properties aren\u2019t going to lose 99% of their value.\n\nThe problem with bitcoin is that it\u2019s impossible to value it because it doesn\u2019t have any fundamentals. The only thing it\u2019s got going for it is that it\u2019s the first mover. It could conceivably lose 100% of it\u2019s worth.",
