The way I see that is, that price of BTC is determined by the supply vs demand (in other words, if people are willing to buy btc for 6K, then its actual price is 6K). I dont understand, why a drop in a hashrate of BTC network (e.g. because of shift of this mining power to other coin like BCH) leads to drop in a price. I would expect that these two entities are independent of each other...",

It's a shame for hardworking entrepreneurs and businessmen. And when you look closer, you see these crypto entrepreneurs celebrating and partying and posting pics on Telegram Groups. Money from investors is waisted on parties. 1999 .com decadency all over again.

It's a HUGE percentage. https://www.google.nl/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/03/16/why-just-8-percent-of-americans-are-invested-in-cryptocurrencies-.html\n\nThe percentage of western people owning btc is 5 percent. An ENORMOUS amount of people own it. That's why this is not 2013. In order to get back at 20k you need HUGE exposure, one never seen before like in december. That's why people who got angry at me in february, when i said it's going to take a very long time, are simply wrong. They are still wrong cause they predict a bullrun in 2019. This is not going to happen, it goes against every logical thinking. All people predicting a bearmarket are right at the moment. You better stop being stubborn and start listeningen to people who's predictions are backed by facts. They are not here to shill or whatever, they simply state facts over and over again. The Elliot wave man was consistently right in his predictions, but was banned and cursed. Why? Because people can't stand the truth. \n\nPeople think it's normal that worthless cryptocompanies are being loaded with 80-100 million? Are you kidding me? They are hugely overrated. They are worth ZERO, extremely overhyped. Normal companies that operate for more than 20 years with very succesfull products don't even have a million to expand their services and have to take account of costs every day, and then you have these worthless cryptocompanies stacked with 800 million? This is insanity. They will implode, cause the local shoestore is worth more than all over of them combined. That's why it's going to be a very very long bearmarket. The market is overrated by 90 percent. 90 percent of MC must go to have a normal rating of the value of these companies. It's going to happen, going to take 3-6 years to let go of that empty air. Graph is going down because of MASSIVE correction. This is how it goes when things are highly, highly overrated. My left stinky shoe is worth more.",

The whole of society was bombarded with news about btc in december, adds flying over people's heads every day. It's going to take years to get these people back into btc, cause it won't happen with a new hype but with slow adoption. Hypes only happen once, never twice. There is no example in history where hypes happen twice. And with hypes, I don't mean the bullrun of 2013, but hypes in society. That being said, I do think that btc can reach 100k one day, but it's going to take a very long time. ",

Those who profited are very lucky to have bought some early, and they profited a shitload thanks to a much larger number of people who buy in later \"inheriting their bags\".\n\nSure I agree that 90% of the time Bitcoin has existed, it has given huge gains.

If everyone was like you we'd have no innovation.\nLook, I get where you developed your perspective, I've invested in stocks and real estate for many years. What you're dismissing here is the CRITICAL difference between bitcoin and every other investment. \n\nYou're missing the fact that unlike other investments, bitcoin's onboarding for entry into the market is scaling as we speak. What was extremely overwhelming to acquire for most people of average technical skills is becoming easier and easier every day to acquire. New apps, improved user interfaces, ETFs, bakkt, platforms to trade for goods, OTCs, and more being added to equation. \n\nOnce the sweet spot of public integration is hit, the hype you thought was the peak will look like a tiny blip, much like the previous all time highs look now when compared to the last run up...even though there were people just like you saying EXACTLY what you are saying then too. And just like you, they too were wrong.",

But why the price will drop significantly? \n\nOne would expect that even if there would be just one hundred computers mining BTC with overall hashrate just few thousands hashes, the price will still be determined by supply and demand of the coins on the market, not by network hashrate. Am I missing something?\n\nReason why i am asking is, that lot of pepople point to the fact, that recent price drop is the result of shifting the hashrate fromt BTC to BCH, which doesnt make sense to me...",

One can only imagine the situation at bitmain and other mining pools.\n\nMining is actually way more riskier than simply buying bitcoin. This is ironic because the popular wisdom is that if you mine at least you can sell the hardware should the coin price tank. Well the way I see it you are risking not only that mining will be profitable but also that the price will hold up. And with bitcoin ASICs there is no other use for them besides mining so if the price tanks the ASICs won't sell either.",

I always take the worst case scenario, this has proven to be very helpful for me, cause it makes me think in problems, that's why i see almost every potential problem with my own business.\n\nI haven't been succesful with investing in crypto though, and it seems that admitting this, is a problem for many people. As if gambling takes somekind of skill. It's mostly luck or patience.\n\nYour reasoning is the same reasoning as what has been said at the beginning of the year by many people. Back then, I said the same thing: bullrun is not going to happen this year, and everything got angry. I say the same thing about 2019. It's not going to happen. Everything you say is a small drop on a burning plate. It's not about making it easy for investors. There is simply no (additional) demand for it. This is logical after a huge crash/.com cryptobubble. The hype is gone, people ask themselves: what is the true value of btc, and the value of blockchain in society, mass euphoria is gone. It has been labeled a hype by society, so you can put a cross on it, until the technology proves its value. But stating simple facts is enough reason for people here to get angry and even threatening to kill you. \n\nI agree with your last statement though. The only thing i say - the only thing i guess - is that it's going to take a long time. If i didn't think the value would go up i wouldn't have invested in it, and i have invested alot. ",

I have had posts removed that I couldn't see anything wrong with, so I get where the complaints are coming from, but my vote would be for the mods to immediately delete & block posts from the negative haters that don't add any value (\"going to zero\" brigade), but to totally allow negative posts if they have something of value to add to the conversation.\n\nI have started doing my part by reporting trolling posts to the mods.
