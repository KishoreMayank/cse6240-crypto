On the other hand, a bearish reversal is confirmed when the histogram dips below zero.\n\nThe bullish turn of the MACD histogram adds credence to BTC's strong defense of the psychological support of $6,000 in the last ten weeks.\n\nFurther, it validates bearish exhaustion indicted by BTC's long-tailed monthly candle and the record low net shorts in the BTC futures market.\n\nAt press time, BTC is trading at $7,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.8 percent appreciation on a 24-hour basis.\n\nView\n\nA combination of the falling channel breakout and the bullish weekly MACD indicates scope for a rally to the July highs above $8,500.\n\nFor the next 24 hours, the investors need to keep an eye on the pennant pattern seen in the 4-hour chart. A bullish breakout could yield a rally to $7,500, while a downside break would shift risk in favor of a drop to $7,000.",

I get that fundamentally a wallet is just a set of private and public keys, so it's not tied to any service/UI/whatever. So that means if I already have funds in a wallet that I made with some other service can I make a coinbase (or whatever service) account with that preexisting wallet?\n\nI've heard of people having their fiat bank accounts frozen after linking it with coinbase/whatever and buying BTC, is this actually that common? Is there an easy workaround for that? I think there are a fes BTC ATMs near me but I assume they charge a fee.\n\nAlso, the keys are generated using the seed phrase right? So the seed phrase isn't just authentication, like a security question with a bank, but rather it's essentially the keys themselves right? Or is that wrong.",

So, the only question is how long will it take barring no interferences from the economy, government regulation or institutional investors. Bitcoin still has not won the hearts of baby boomers (or older), poor people and high class elitists and women (which I heard can be won with a box of chocolates). Bitcoin is predominantly purchased by young 18-45, middle class white and Asian males. As an African American, this makes me in the extreme minority. Obviously, mass adoption and consumer confidence is the road to this $1.7 trillion market cap and beyond. I\u2019m not so concerned about age, race, gender and wealth class as all will follow once mass adoption and consumer confidence has been established. Any thoughts on Bitcoin demographics?",

            "Text": "\\>I  get that fundamentally a wallet is just a set of private and public  keys, so it's not tied to any service/UI/whatever.\n\nYes, most wallets are not tied to anything and store your private keys. Public keys are generated from private keys and addresses are generated from public keys.\n\n\\>So that means if I  already have funds in a wallet that I made with some other service can I  make a coinbase (or whatever service) account with that preexisting  wallet?\n\nGenerally you cannot import your keys but you open an account with Coinbase or another exchange (preferably Bitstamp), ask for a deposit which will generate an address for you to scan or copy, finally you send the funds from your wallet to your account. But your coins are a lot safer offline than online.\n\n\\>I've heard of people having their  fiat bank accounts frozen after linking it with coinbase/whatever and  buying BTC, is this actually that common? Is there an easy workaround  for that?\n\nDon't know much about that, never had any problem but I'm in Switzerland.\n\n\\>I think there are a fes BTC ATMs near me but I assume they  charge a fee.\n\nYes, usually 4-6%.\n\n\\>Also, the keys are  generated using the seed phrase right? So the seed phrase isn't just  authentication, like a security question with a bank, but rather it's  essentially the keys themselves right?\n\nCorrect, the seed phrase is used to regenerate in a deterministic way your private keys as they were before.\n\nDon't hesitate if you have other questions. Good luck !",

            "Text": "My pleasure, I think you're making a very good move (as long as you're doing it for the long-term) and the person who made the gift was wise to choose Bitcoin itself and not an altcoin.\n\nI must tell you that ben.co is not one of the open-source wallets that are very much trusted and used by the community. The old adage is \"not your keys, not your Bitcoins\". With this wallet it seems you have your own passphrase and therefore are in control of your keys but personally I'm not sure I would trust them. Just buying and selling from them is of course less risky as long as you immediately transfer most of your coins to another address. For this, I'm using Bitstamp because nobody has ever lost a coin with them, the fees are medium-low, it's fast and they take good care of the blockchain ; but I hear the process to get registered is rather long now. Of course many people use Coinbase/Coinbase Pro.\n\nIt also depends on the amount you're planning to invest. They are many scams and dangers but if it's a small amount for you, why not ; otherwise the Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets are extremely secure and convenient for something like $100, not much effort I would say. Good non-hardware wallets are Electrum (desktop, Android), Samourai and maybe GreenAddress (IOS). \n\nJust in case you've got some time to kill, here's a link to my favorite paper about Bitcoin : https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1",

For what it's worth I disagreed with the guy but always picked him out for someone who didn't really hate bitcoin but bought in on the high and wanted a social \"hedge\" against the failure of the investment. If it went back up he'd get his money back; if it went down he'd at least have company in misery. \n\nI actually think a lot of trolls here are like that. In general as someone who has been in the Bitcoin scene for a long time (since back when Gavin was still taken seriously) I really roll my eyes at all the price commentary on both sides. I'm getting antsy. I am ready for Bitcoin to do what it set out to do... end government control of money.\n\n",

That statement is true to EVERY money. Fiat money is a subset of all money, and that statement is true to every kind of currency in human history and currencies of the future too. \n\nWhat? You say it is not true for bitcoin? Well mate, thats why you would starve to death if you only had btc and no fiat currency :) Thats why you can't even buy a baguett with it. \n\n> TC has a pre-determined fixed supply. \n\nFirst of all, no, it is not pre determined, it is determined by how many mining there are currently. This is why it will never be adopted as a standalone currency. A nation cannot base the economy on chinese server farms. A nation cannot afford to let its currency be supplied by server farms. Imagine the 2008 mortgage crisis if the US couldn't break the inflation... Ah wait, you know what its like, since the btc you own often drops 30-70% in a week :)\n\n>  It is also global and cannot be tied to a country's GDP but rather global GDP.\n\nNo, it can only be tied to supply and demand. Fiat money is correlating with gdp because the CB can control the money supply. Noone can control the money supply of btc. \n\n> BTC also has alternative uses beyond a currency due to its immutable ledger.\n\nNo and stop this religious bullshit. BTC has only one use, you can buy it and you can pray for it to go up for no apparent reason whatsoever. \n\nFinancial scientology. ",
