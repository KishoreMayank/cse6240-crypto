Soon you won't need fiats. Everything, house, goods, health everything you will need crypto.\n\nIf you are selling now, you are giving up your future securities. The banks and rich are buying OTC. They are buying in large sums and then dump it so you will sell where then they will buy at lower price.\n\nIf you appreciate fiat money, that is your choice. Personally, the world is in cryptocurrency ( BTC ) and Blockchain ( ETH ).\n\nSo if you are buying crypto to earn more fiat good for you. But behind the scene the rich are buying up your crypto by doing pump and dump via OTC. \n\nIf you hodl, you make it more expensive for them to buy and they won't have choice but to buy. This is why there are many that believe BTC will moon to 50K. Of course we must work together. \n\nFiat will feed you now, but soon you will wish you have more crypto.\n\nGood luck!\n",

Fiat currency is a system that worked for centuries, and still works. Balance of Btc after 10 years: failed system because of fixed supply, because of deflation. Result: nobody uses it, no use case.

            "Text": "Part 1: Bernie Sanders Effect. \n\nYou see, during the presidential election, pro Sanders Trolls (probably Russian Bots) said things like \"Bernie speaks my language and I love his platform so much that I would have his offspring\". The comments like this were so crazy that most of us educated people got turned off by moronic comments like this. \n\nPeople came here and said the most bizarre stuff they read in some paper or youtube video, with ZERO understanding of how human beings think or work. Apple pay is still a failure, as is google pay. Bitcoin pay will not suddenly come along and outpace both of them as a payment means or payment system. Why? Banks give cash back, banks often take the hit when accounts are hacked. Banks provide insurance and offer services and peace of mind. People got turned off by the lies and nonsense many bitcoiners shouted from within these digital walls.\n\nPart 2.\nLet's say that MOST people are actually smart (they aren't). But let's say they are. Let's say that bitcoin pay is a technically better way to pay - in theory. But let's look at the reality. Do phones break? Yup. So bitcoin pay is not reliable. Do internets drop out? Yup. Bitcoin is not reliable. Do credit cards go down when the internet is out? Yup, and if credit cards go down, so does Bitcoin Pay. So, really, credit cards is still the preferred method of payment. Debit too. And, here is the real kicker. People are SO incredibly LAZY that honestly, nobody in Milwaukee Wisconson with a high school education is going to pay EXTRA to buy bitcoin to pay for the same purchase they could pay for with a credit card (2% back) or debit card. I know, 'but what about buying stuff from China' is the counter argument. Well, that's like 1% of 1% actually buy stuff from those type websites. Most of the people in Milwaukee don't. There is zero incentive for them to use Bitcoin Pay, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. There is zero reason for Bitcoin to be adopted other than some revolutionary concept. But mind you, people know that shopping at WalMart hurts american jobs, but they still go there. Same with banks and debit cards. \n\nPart 3.\nNow if you are still reading, Kudos. Blockchain is amazing technology, and Blockchain technology will never die. It will be reborn like a phoenix into the banking sector and become something amazing. Just as LaserDisc got reborn into Blu-Ray, so will BlockChain Technology. Humans are just not ready for a global currency. We are still believing in fictional dieties from the sky. \n\nPart 4.\nIs Christianity correct over, say Buddhist? Is Muslim beliefs correct over Christianity? So many teachings of different things and so many teachings that are similar. Same with Alt-Coins. Why use Bitcoin over Litecoin? Why not use Amazon-Coin? If there was ever a global currency, Amazon should be the one to name it. There is _only_ market domination and that's it. \n\nPart 5.\nWhere does the FIAT go?  Seriously. When you buy Bitcoin, what are you actually buying? I think the fiat actually goes to bitcoin, sort of. It really goes from your hand, right over to the gas and electric company of the person who mined that bitcoin. You are essentially handing money right to the power company, and a few people along the way are going to give you a receipt called 'bitcoin' that has no value unless you can convince your neighbors it does. You don't have to convince your neighbors to use fiat, because fiat is used everywhere globally. Bitcoin is used almost nowhere, and only has value when people believe in it. Fiat is used everywhere not because people believe in it, but because it's the accepted coin of the realm. ",

It will be used where it's application is best suited, particularly for online purchases at first.\n\nPart 2. I'm not sure where you live but when internet goes down so does credit and debit card payments, and the temporary cash only signs go up. Fiat will continue to exist for many, many years. Bitcoin is an alternative, with incentives that will escalate in numbers going forward (push payment, low fees, investment/currency/value store,  deflationary, hybrid asset class).\n\nPart 3. Nobody would be talking blockchain if not for bitcoin. Blockchain is the buzz word, dot com of the present day that companies associate themselves with to get short lived hype on the stock market. Bitcoin IS blockchain. Read a few thousand articles, listen to a few hundred podcasts, hear what the dev communities are saying. The hands down most efficient use of blockchain IS currency, and bitcoin has just about laid a stable enough of a foundation to really start building on now. Ten years under load, attacked, etc., now it has the credibility. Most other projects have not even passed the whitepaper stage. Maybe one day there will be a bitcoin 2.0  that eventually catches up to bitcoin's hash power and brand, but for now, this one is just getting started.\n\nPart 4. Alt coins and ICOs are \"mostly\" an expected byproduct of Bitcoin. It's normal for success to be followed by attempts to emulate that success. It's human nature. I can copy Amazon's business model but that doesn't mean I'll have the resources and retailers jump on board with me.\n\nPart 5. See above. Bitcoin and Fiat can co-exist, as they should for years to come.\n\nYou're welcome.",

You are smart enough to know that it will never happen. Never. All economies are interconnected. If the US Economy tanks, so will China, So will Tokyo, so will Dubai, so will Europe. We are all interconnected like a giant spider web. Countries NEED their own cash to float their own loans. Hence, Bitcoin is not the answer they will use. If anything, they will come together and create their own. No country would EVER lose power to a global sharing of currency. Are you crazy?  That would cause the world to plunge into chaos. Countries need to retain power in order to have law. \n\nNow, I see in your history you joined 2 months ago, so I have to wonder about your account? Are you a russian bot account here just to sow deception? It seems odd to me that you so quickly troll me when I merely post reasonable arguments. Let me do what you did, and create several fake accounts. ",

            "Text": "Thank you for this well written argument. You are like one out of 100 that post in the sub. Most people write gibberish. \n\nPlastic credit cards is easy. Relying on cell phones is a bad idea for now. If cell phone batteries and screens get better, then electronic currency like Apple Pay and Bitcoin Pay MIGHT become good. However, I really think it will take 20 years for this to be a real thing, and by that time, something new is bound to come along. \"Retina Pay\" in which you just look into a scanner with your eye to pay. It will still link your bank account to another bank account.\n\nBitcoin's biggest thing is being able to buy something from another country at whatever rate it's trading at. But it's not stable. So, if I buy for .40 bitcoin right now, by 5pm I could have lost half my money. The lack of stability makes it a terrible thing to use as a coin. For inside the country, fiat will still be king, as I will get paid in fiat, and pay rent in fiat because banks and the government will want fiat also. So there is no incentive to really switch. There really isn't. There is not enough of a benefit to the day to day person to pay extra to use bitcoin. Maybe in 20 years, but again, by then there will be some altcoin (based on bitcoin like BluRay is based on LaserDisc) that will advance the technology further. \n\nI love the romanticism of bitcoin and have owned some, but I just don't think we are really ready yet. I still feel like we are the same place 5 years ago.. a lot of people talking about it and how cool it is, but no real use for the day to day person.",

They are the bottom of the list, and the ones most important. Knowing that they still write checks, leads me to believe that we are in for a very long wait on adoption. Because of this fact, by the time Bitcoin actually gets any legs and steam, something new and better will come along. The blockchain backbone will stay but in a different magnitude than we see now. I can see the ACH (clearing house for banks) coming up with a banking blockchain (which they already sort-of have now) in which there is no more ACH and payments inbetween banks are more instant instead of the 24-48 hours things take to clear, but honestly it's gotten much better with things like Cash App in which I can transfer money instantly for free. There is little incentive when there is tech that is very close to bitcoin already out there. I am not saying bitcoin isn't better, because it is. But it's like, if I said to you you have to drive an extra 10 minutes to save $2 per gas tank when you fill it up, most people won't go the 10 minutes. Same with bitcoin. Sure it might cost 1% more to convert, and an extra step, but what are you really getting in return over fiat? Not much.",

A store of value that aligns with a digital society and knows no geographical boundaries has great potential. As for the elderly  folks you speak of, they will be long deceased before something as etched into our lives as currency could ever be reshaped. Mass adoption would take generations at minimum. Many potential developments could divert the direction of all this so as I said earlier, all we have at this early point is speculation...as we see by the rapidly growing crypto market. I enjoy the high risk investment game, and I only use disposable income that I can afford to lose after other investments are secured.",
