However, I\u2019m still up considerably and tbh it looks like bitcoin is still in a bull market from my perspective. Yes it hit 20k and burned down to 6k, but to me that was just a crazy spec bubble in the middle of a bull market. I mean literally I when I started the price was 1.5k and now it\u2019s 6k. It feels like we are back to normal growth and will see 8-10k in a year or so as more people come to understand the value of the network. \n\nWhat im saying is that if you zoom out we are still in a bull market. Don\u2019t buy shit when it goes parabolic is the lesson for those that did. ",

            "Text": "**Sony Unveils Contactless Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet** \\- This is not small news. What it represents is involvement in the crypto space from big, legit players. The thing is, I remember a time when this kind of a headline would have been hard to believe. These days developments are springing up out of the woodwork, and the price and volume remain unaffected. In my opinion, this is because we are in a period where there were so many claims of a $100,000 Bitcoin over the past year that people not even invested yet are extra cautious. BUT ... once the reality of all these developments, investment platform, layers, sidechains, etc kicks in to gear, we may see a surge in a very short time. Bottom line, this space is maturing quickly and the future looks very bright for bitcoin and the crypto space, no matter how you choose to view it!\n\n[https://humbleoracle.com/2018/10/25/sony-unveils-contactless-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet/](https://humbleoracle.com/2018/10/25/sony-unveils-contactless-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet/)",

I understand that Bitcoin has to be attacked in order to continue to survive and supply trust. A hardfork is the hardest thing it could encounter next to the mt gox hack. \n\nBitcoin decided to stay at 1mb and implement innovative technology such as Segwit and Lightning (which only works with Segwit). If the Bitcoin community does not use these innovations, it is just btrash which just increases block sizes and centralizes  miners. \n\nIt has yet to recover from that hardfork if Segwit isn\u2019t implemented.

Good to see that price always follows interest, which gives me the mathematical certainty that bitcoin can't fall below 5800 in 3 or 4 weeks time. The rules are very simple, but we are too stupid to follow the rules, let alone block our impulses. Increase of bitcoin to 20.000 will take 4-6 years, so i will have 300% gains. Great investment. ",

The value of those \"bank dollars\" being IOU's themselves, \"backed\" by ~10% of its value in paper notes; which in themselves are really only backed by our collective ability to repay our ever growing debts.\n\nWhereas transacting Bitcoin transfers an asset of free-market determined value; complete settlement of which can take place within an hour.\n\nTo me that is much more \"real\" than an IOU that can be revoked 90 days later.\n\nThe only value of fiat is that it can be exchanged for things you actually value. It sounds tautological but its actually an important distinction that USD are ultimately a liability and not an asset, since they are born out of debt.",

I don't now how long people can wait before btc rises to ath of 20.000 again, but most people don't understand how exceptional 20.000 was. It was exceptional because so many people were investing in bitcoin. 5% in western countries is very very high. In 3 weeks time in december so many people from the mass jumped in. One should ask the question: where will new money come from. The vast majority of people just don't like crypto nor bitcoin and will never like it. Also, search results for crypto dropped since january. It was the first time the search results dropped since the launch of bitcoin. It means crypto hit the ceiling. It will be very very difficult to breach the ceiling, and the past 10 months proved this. ",
