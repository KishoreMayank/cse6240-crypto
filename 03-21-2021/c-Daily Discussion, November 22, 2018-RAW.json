You called \"bubble\" over and over until you were right, just like thousands of other armchair economists. We get that you think bitcoin is a ponzi or a pyramid scheme. We get that you think they're digital beanie babies, doomed to sit forever in someone's digital closet collecting dust. We get that you think a limited supply, decentralized, unregulated currency has no chance of ever succeeding.\n\nSo my question is - why are you still here? What are you hoping to accomplish by repeating the same arguments over and over? **We heard all the exact same shit in 2011, and here we are two years later, still trading at \\~$70.** You aren't going to convince us that bitcoin is dead, or even dying, so why bother? What's your goal here? You won't rest until every poor sap has pulled all their dollars out of BTC so the world economy can get on with business as usual?\n\n.................\n\nWhy don't you just come back in two or three years when the next bubble inevitably pops and try to convince us again? **Third time's the charm, right? Will you be using the same arguments if it reaches a high of over $1000 and crashes back to a stable $250?**",

            "Text": " Buying Bitcoin when it is down 80% from ATH is not analogous to buying Enron or Lehman stock on its way down. When stocks are plummeting, you are not getting the same for less. That's because the stock has value only because of the earning potential of the company behind it and a plummeting stock is usually the result of lower earnings, lower future potential of earnings, management incompetence and most importantly bankruptcy risk i.e the risk of the stock ceasing to exist. \n\nWith bitcoin however, the thing you are getting for 0.2x of ATH now is exactly what you were getting at ATH. There is negligible risk of bitcoin ceasing to exist and there is no deterioration in the way bitcoin technologically works.\n\nThis is why the idea that a 80% fall will deter new buyers is flawed. Infact since they are getting same for less, they will be encouraged. I know because I was in the same boat as a new buyer in 2016. I will also add that people who buy in times like this are much more likely to HODL and stay comforted during volatility because they do so after some research about how bitcoin works. During a bull phase, most jump in because hey it is going up. They are the ones who fret and fret when momentum reverses and turn on to be what are called 'weak hands'. \n\nThis transfer from weak hands to strong hands is why bitcoin has historically launched into a mega bull run after previous 80% fall events.

What I found is that for the moment nothing help me forecasting the future price. Mostly using TA you can understand  in the aftermath what happened. If I see the last two big bearish impulse, let me say  the one that brought the price from 6400 to 5400 and the second one from 5400 to 4400 they have different nature. The first was brutal and very fast, likely it triggered many stop losses. The second is a movement  dictated by the price maker, also brutal but no stop losses has been triggered for me. The believers  still are inside while the speculators are already out at the moment. In order to have a rebounce  in most cases price have to react immediately just after stop losses are triggered. In this case the reaction is too slow, and all make me think  we are taking a breath before a new deep fall. Anyway I'm not selling.",

            "Text": "With 80% of all possible Bitcoin already mined, why is the current plan to slowly release the remaining 20% over the next 121 years?  Shouldn't there be a tipping point where the artificial difficulty is dropped to 0 and miners switch to earning money through transaction fees?  At the current rate of things, miners will be getting 0.390625 Bitcoins per block in 20 years, and about 2.32831E\u22128 Bitcoins per block near the year 2140. Will it be worth the effort?\n\nIf the block mining network is sustainable with low Bitcoin yield or no yield, why continue with forcing the last few Bitcoins to be slowly released over 121 years?

Naysayers will try to claim that last year was bigger and that now everyone is scared to re-enter the market but let me assure you people were far more concerned then. We had nothing to look forward to then, very little to even hope for. Today there's more infrastructure growth then we ever expected this soon. And bitcoin price is not such an issue when unlike stock shares, you don't have to purchase a whole bitcoin. So if you lose 85% of $X that you decided to invest, it's the exact same amount REGARDLESS of bitcoin price!  \nNow we get to worry less about price and more about watching to see where this all leads. The potential applications of the Bitcoin blockchain are plentiful to say the least.  \n",

The market is cyclical, BECAUSE of the technology growth. The infrastructure grows, the price catches up. The infrastructure pulls ahead again, then the price catches up. Anyone that can't see this are simply blinded by inflated prices that result from excessive hype. Too much too soon scenarios always need to pull back in markets, but in the long run there's been nothing but growth in both the tech and the price of BTC. \n\nAnyone who followed the simple rule of not investing more than they can afford should never be focused on the price too much anyway. Trolls think we're all over invested, but comments like yours help to provide insight that many of us simply enjoy following the tech evolution! I admit I'm a bit of a geek as an IT and network security admin, but you don't have to be a techie to enjoy following Bitcoin development.

But as far as polluting the planet, there are many other concern that we need to address with pollution that push bitcoin  way down the list...despite the scare articles that were pushed out.\nSeveral mining companies have been experimenting with recycling the energy and I recall reading about one that used the heat. We are barely getting off the ground with this technology so innovative ways to conserve and recycle energy will likely be a large part of the next ten years for bitcoin. There's also the possibility of computing power that requires less energy and more efficient ways of keeping the processor cool. Exciting times ahead!",

            "Text": "Interesting that your story excludes the first 9 years of bitcoin. Your explanation was fairly accurate, considering it was pre event, except for the saturation part. Most people by far were too intimidated by the required technical level of entry. So many people wanted to buy a little piece of the action but it was over their heads.\n\nWe may feel like it's second nature to grab a wallet address and configure cold storage etc, but the vast majorty of potential investors in crypto do not want to mess with such things. There are still loads of people who don't even know what bitcoin is other than they heard of it.\n\nSo no it was no where near saturated. User friendly onramps for crypto could easily increase the volume again. But if so, then it would still likely form another bubble scenario, I mean who doesn't love to cash out gains. Bitcoin also has begun the integration with digital money so who knows where it all will lead.",

It\u2019s had 7 days of shitcoin-like  crashing, dropping in the double digits percentage-wise. Many of you  never imagined Bitcoin could fall below $6K and there surely was great  support at the level...by whom? You couldn\u2019t say...there was just some  imaginary support the whales mislead you in believing. I said many times  that Bitcoin would fall below $5K by the end of the year into the  beginning of 2019. Many labeled me as a paranoid FUD pot-stirrer. No I  just read historical trends and understand support at nearly 10x the  start of the last bull run (when BTC was $600) can\u2019t be held forever.  Today, Bitcoin is performing exactly like every shitcoin and that\u2019s why  so many of you are in shock. I don\u2019t care much for altcoins but unlike  many of you, I don\u2019t worship Bitcoin especially BCashBeTrash, he\u2019s the  biggest culprit. And any of you who would not sell at $6K but are now  selling at $4.8K are delusional beyond repair. Sure, the pain hurts but  at least hold until ***BTC returns to $6K which it will most certainly will  in the next 3 months***...or institute a stop-buy plan where you can rebuy  BTC at a safe price.  Buying high and selling low is exactly how you go  broke. You might have lost value in your BTC but you don\u2019t lose money  until you sell your coins...    \"\"\"\"",

Ideally we should be back in the $5,000 range within a couple weeks and maintain it. It's still ridiculously possible that we are going to create a lower low. It just depends on who is selling. The really optimistic thing is the hashwar seems to be calming down a little. Lord only knows how much BTC Craig was selling to support his project. Or Roger for that matter.

This we will call the floor as in the production floor. the ceiling is the maximum a client is willing to pay before saying wtf.  \n\n\nThis is like your support and resistance on the gold / silver / whatever precious metal market.   \n\n\nIn BTC we have the same dynamic, but also LOADS of people who  \n1. dont know this  \n2. never traded before  \n3. think this is a lottery ticket  \n\n\nBecause of this, those people are being run around by technical analysis. Which mostly of what i see is total nonsense, by people who are not CFTe accredited, who have never worked for a fund, who have never traded FX or stocks and are basically dumb money lambs for the slaughter.  \n\n\nThis money I called retail noise. It is like a layer of mud that flys around the market. Like how a trucks tyres spins after off roading in deep mud. You dont know where it will fly, but it will fly off.  \n\n\nSo the retail noise right now is scared. Thing is fundementally nothing changed. We still need to transfer money for cheap across the world, and people want an alternative to fiat. its just bobby says its crashing right now and everyone is throwing up in their shoes.   \n\n\nBUT...  \n\n\nYour dollar will keep becoming worthless.  \n\n\nYou will need money.  \n\n\nThings will fuck up, in the big picture - that make you want an alternative again.   \n\n\nGold will still be gold.  \n\n\nFor this reasons people will want to buy bitcoin again at some point. When people actually want to buy the retail noise gets sucked up pretty fast. Most is margin nonsense spoof orders that a few hundred 'day traders' run after as indicators flash and go bleep buy no sell no buy now ohh i dont know just go all in and margin call why dont you..  \n\n\nSo with all that crap going on, we see al this nonsense price moves but actual new coins from the mine are not distributed.  \n\n\nBy the time we reach the higher difficulty and its harder to get, more people know about bitcoin. Retail noise is as loud as a superbowl crowd cheering and the cost of production will be much higher. So market will be only find new coins distributed at the price the miners want to sell at.  \n\n\nIf it popular, hard to find a new coin and getting more scarce everyday. People will pay more. And that's about it.  \n\n\nCan't happen with gold tho, too many factors. Someone always finds some more or they prefer to buy a growth stock. This in theory should not happen with BTC because of the fungible and technical aspect.   \n\n\nCould happen with BTC also though, but only if everyone quits. ",

            "Text": "I just quickly checked your post history. If you're curious about this stuff and you wonder about manipulation and the doj along with the question you just asked. Believe me there's some pretty good answers and I will give you a quick outline. Number one there are a lot of scummy people involved in crypto. If you look around and you see things that make you scratch your head and think this isn't right. Well yes. There really is no denying that\n\nNow on to your questions. Bch was a fork of Bitcoin last year. It was supported by a very small select audience that eventually Drew in a group of people. The thing that turn me off about it from the get-go was the way it is marketed. It's like used car salesman mentality. Lots of marketing. But if you actually take the time and study the blockchain and study the development of both you come away realizing that what you had were a group of people that did not respect consensus. Were not interested in developing Bitcoin. They wanted to promote their own product and capitalize on it\n\nAs far as the Department of Justice there are a couple of things going on and one of them are with ico's. A lot of these are pump and dumps. The second thing is with tether. Now I'm not sure about the articles or the evidence they are looking at because the way it is written they are saying that tether magically supported the market at Key moments. Well that's what Traders do with tether. They buy the dip and upward trending Market. The real question is are there enough dollars to cover all of the tether. We are going to find out the answer to that within the next few months because circle is basically taking over.\n\nBitcoin looks a little bit scary when you first notice it. There are a lot of people that you kind of get weird feelings about. The best thing you can do since you genuinely seem curious is research. Spend time learning how Bitcoin works. Learning how lightning Network operates. Study. Really try and avoid forming opinions based on marketing material",

            "Text": "As a brit there are a couple things about Craig I want to bring up.\n\n1. He's an aussie\n2. His attempt to be high class at any attempt and coming off with no class\n3. His atrocious spelling.  \n\n\nI know high school teachers with better spelling then Craig. If this guy is a professor, the university is not worth sweet FA. No way would someone write the way he does, and the kind of spelling he uses.  \n\n\nAlso in a vocal discussion, he has no class. No etiquete or social manner, he comes across as a moron. A blithering fool. He tries to use all the biggest words possible, but honestly if you put him against a real professor he just looks like a moron.  \n\n\nYou notice how Craigs never been to any of the prestigious places like the Oxford debating club, yet people who profess all kinds of far out concepts - much wilder than that of bitcoin appear in the debating hall. Craig has never mad such appearance, even in his first interview he claimed he would never be seen again.  \n\n\nLet's just get real, his mother even said he gets carried away with his lies. He was possibly involved in BTC at the start, or maybe through some bizarre stroke of luck come across the early seeds of the BTC idea in the cypherpunks movement / mailing lists.   \n\n\nHe for certain is not a coder, who would create such a masterpiece and now hire coders. Secondly who the fuck would want large blocks. I am sure anyone with a basic grasp of networks understands you want as lightweight traffic as possible. There is no benefit to absurdly large blocks. It's just stupid. Craigs white papers make nonsense, he talks garbage and he is an emotional wreck.   \n\n\nWhen asked just basic questions at a public talk (which he does in a pub cellar, of course. where else.. why not a ted talk? Why not some where prominent.. he hides in the shadows) he exploded and acted so uncouth the real character comes out. A con man. And an arrogant one at that.  \n\n\nCraig has no idea of this though, his examples are always a joke. The thing about computing is it's very easy to prove something. Especially with Bitcoin, if he was the real deal - he could transfer coins from the original wallets. But he cannot. He can disclose the truth behind closed doors to a select few, now we have a tin foil hat 911 case.  \n\n\nSo what the fuck actually happened and will we ever know? Would it change anything if you knew?  \n\n\nEven if he is Satoshi, he cant code for shit. A fact everyone seems to overlook. Satoshi started this whole thing off, why the fuck does Craig not just write more code in his expensive coding chair in front of his suits of armour? (what a wanker)  \n\n\nHe doesn't talk like a coder, he doesn't appear mentally disciplined either. Notice how many high level successful people are physically fit and engage in a much more charismatic world view.  \n\n\nCraig talks like a confident trickster, using big words that spoof most people (absurdly) in this space. If you know a coder you trust, some computer science major who knows crypto, ask him his honest opinion. Show him Craig talking. Give it a real looking into.  \n\n\nI've never met anyone who didn't say that Craig is full of shit.   \n\n\nI once asked Craig some pretty open and easy to answer questions on twitter, such as why didn't he make the changes to BTC and put a pull request in. He blocked me.",

And then the crash is even bigger and shakes the fucking ground. And you know what else??? The next high is gonna trap even more FOMO infected investors in a higher buy in and crash their asses even harder to the ground and lives will be wrecked like an earthquake wrecks not like the train of the last one. So you either know when to get in and when to get out or you go along for the ride until you\u2019re shook to shit inside.\n...or you don\u2019t play but act like those dipshits in the cheap seats who wanted to be in the game but likes to pretend they know how to make the best shots.

I don't really keep up on Bitcoin but I keep thinking, if the value of Bitcoin comes from scarcity and the difficulty in mining it, where does the value come from when it's not worth mining?  And if there is value outside of mining, why try and force the value to come from mining?  Why is the artificial difficulty regularly increased and the block output halved every four years?  There's no point in dragging it out for another 121 years if the Bitcoin currency system can be sustained without mining for new Bitcoins.",

            "Text": "The difficulty is artificially increasing.  Reducing it would put it back to normal difficulty.  I don't see how that would reduce security.\n\nCurrently 657,450 btc are payed out to miners per year.  As difficulty increases it's going to take 56 years to mine enough blocks to get the last 10 btc.  And if you wanted the value of mining those blocks to be worth the same as mining blocks today (with 1 btc = $4400) then 1 btc would have to be worth 4.7 trillion dollars.  And if 1 btc was worth 4.7 Trillion, then 1 Satoshi would be worth $47,244.00 and the total value of all bitcoin would be worth 99.2 Quintilian dollars.\n\nI just feel like earning money through block subsidy is not sustainable.  Why not switch to focusing on earning money through transaction fees?\n\nThe other problem with artificial difficulty is the number of transactions that are processed.  With an average of 2500 transactions per block and 144 blocks processed per day, that means about 360,000 bitcoin transactions can be processed per day.  Compare that with 95,000,000 credit card transactions per day in the US, plus 35,000,000 per day in the UK, plus however many for the rest of the world.  The only way Bitcoin can become more than a niche currency is if the mining difficulty is dropped.",

Bakkt is click bait vaporware that will probably not happen at any point. Robinhood was a bust. Localbtc is scammy at best. I still cant use it for any real world purpose without headache and fees.

            "Text": "Bitcoin keeps everyone honest, including speculators. There is nothing built-in to Bitcoin that guarantees an investor will make big returns. The only guarantee is that the inflation rate of Bitcoin cannot be manipulated - which means, a 3rd party cannot coerce the system into stealing your money. But that doesn't mean speculation is good.\n\nWhen you speculate, without contributing anything at all, expecting something from nothing, the laws of economics punishes you for such a terrible decision. When you take the gamble that Bitcoin adoption will be at some point at some time in the future, again, a terrible decision that will be punished.\n\nThe beauty is, people will learn. They might leave Bitcoin forever, deciding it was a scam. But good riddance, their only \"contribution\" was hoping to \"cash out\" later - taking their money back, with some fantasy gains they had in mind.  Or, they might learn from the experience, start to question their own crazy thoughts of speculation, and start grounding their decisions in reality rather than price movements. A huge win for both them, and for Bitcoin.\n\nPrice talk is noise and nonsense. If the price drops, it means a lot of people who didn't need to be holding Bitcoin in the first place, stopped holding Bitcoin. Because if they truly needed it, they wouldn't have sold it. So it's actually giving a much more accurate painting of Bitcoin. Furthermore, it pushes greedy miners to slow down. Yes, mining is good, but excessive mining is also meaningless. The only price that matters are the lows, and the more lows we have, the better. And if the newer lows are higher than the previous lows, it's a sign of good growth. And if the newer lows are lower than the previous lows, then we're getting healthier but possibly not healthy yet.",

Something that will take multiple generations at the very least to see fully realized. \n\nAlso, people losing money by risking it on the potential outcome of this technology should realize that it needs to take time. They should also allocate no more than 5% of their investment money towards anything that they would need to cash out this soon. Long term investment means you haven't lost anything until you need to cash out. And tell me, why would anyone expect to cash out of such an incredibly new tech investment so soon?

What limits a regular bank is regulations and that they only create money when it is demanded by a borrower which relies on the borrower making sound economic decisions.  All of that is riggable and prone to plain risk.  That is where the \"genius\" of a central bank comes into play.  A central bank has no such limits.  It can create whatever amount of money it wishes.  Legal tender law government borrowing and other law ensure demand for these imaginary accounting entries.  Regular banks then operate with almost no risk because they have the unique privilege of borrowing from central banks if they need to. \n\nWhen the US ended the Bretton Woods arrangement that limited fiat printing to a gold standard, the world entered into a new experiment with drastic consequences.  Since then all economic gain has been financialized, and has been captured by the 0.1% at the cost of the loss of the middle class and thereby the growing radicalism both left and right.  Almost every nation is failing in this fashion.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. It happened many times in history.  Fiat money is a scourge to civilization, the cause of much war and tragedy.  \n\nThe only limit is self imposed. The art is simply not to scam too fast and hyperinflate and lose control and be replaced by a new set of people.  \n\nSources.\n\nBooks\n\nThe Creature from Jekyll Island\n\nConfessions of an Economic Hitman\n\nTragedy and Hope\n\nThis Time is Different\n\nWar is a Racket\n\nVideo Documentaries\n\nPrinces of the Yen\n\nMike Maloney Hidden Secrets of Money\n\nBill Sill did one I can't remember the name.  \n\n",

The amount invested and the percentage lost is the same. The fact is you think that you and others are calling it a dead tech, a bubble, a shitty investment now are any different than those who said these EXACT same thing in 2014? Bitcoin was considered completely dead then, I mean just totally wrote off. Then it came back just as I believe it will do again. I bought it when it was beat up and everyone called it dead because it was dropping. I got it for 300 bucks and then again the next year it went even lower and I bought more. You don't buy when it's going great, you buy when it's beat up and not hyped. \nIn any case, I understand the loss and the it is very frustrating because I've been there. I am there again now with anything I put in during the past year, so I am not being a hypocrite. I'm just tried of hearing people insulting everyone else on here, it's crazy.",

THEN after all these impossible situations then it could be controlled by those 100 whales. Remember value from bitcoin comes from it's use and people willing to buy it and if nobody wants it or uses it, it is not valuable.\n\nEDIT: Also by those whales buying up all the bitcoin they can see they would essentially drive the price up making bitcoin more expensive and the more people that get some the harder it is for the whales to control.  Everybody who had bitcoin before this whale attack would make everybody a bunch of money.",
