The news that New York's attorney general is taking a closer look at major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the state may also have dampened the bull mood.\n\nThe sudden price drop raised the possibility that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 had run out of steam.\n\nHowever, BTC's sharp return from $7,873 to $8,160 this morning established the area around $7,800 as a strong support level and indicates a strong dip-demand mentality in the market. For the second time in the last three days, a dip below the $8,000 mark was quickly undone.\n\nThe recovery witnessed this morning adds credence to the bullish moving average studies.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $8,090 on Bitfinex - largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.\n\n**View**\n\nBTC will likely test supply around $8,400 in the next 24 hours. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that level would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.\n\nOn the downside, $7,870 (today's low) is the key level to watch out for. BTC's failure to defend the key support level could yield a pullback to $7,510 (former resistance turned support).\n\nOnly a daily close below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would indicate the rally from the low of $6,425 has ended.",

I first heard of it from my brother when it was only worth a few dollars and he told me to start mining some. (I didn't and boy do I regret that..)\n\nI've been interested in buying a few times during these years, but never really understood how to get hold of some. It seemed too complicated and I never really tried to be honest, but the last two years that changed.\n\n2016 I started googling and found out you needed a wallet etc. There were so many wallets to choose from that I wasn't sure which ones to trust and I was intimidated. I ended up giving up (again, big regret...).\n\nBeginning of 2017 I thought to myself that it was now or never. This time I actually got as far as getting myself a wallet. The next step was to acquire some coins to put in it. The easiest way after some googling seemed like buying from an exchange. Here is where I ran into a wall this time. To get approved (or whatever is it called) I had to send them pictures of my ID and some recent bills. I was living with my parents at the moment and the bills were in their name, so again I gave up (Regret regret regret).\n\n Yes, I am very lazy and give up as soon as I run into a tiny bump on the road.. BUT I am a relatively young guy. I have used conputers, played videogames and bought new technology my entire life. If I couldn't figure out how to buy and own bitcoin, how is my mom or dad going to?\n\nI think that when it's as easy to buy bitcoin as it is to buy in-game currency in videogames, then we will really see new money flow in.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and grammar. Just a Swedish guy that needed to vent. I'm cross-posting this in a few places because it took me a really long time to write and I want it to be seen, hehe.\n\nPS. I ended up buying into an ETF in Sweden that follows the \nprice of bitcoin and one that follows ethereum. In december 2017.....\n\nTL:DR Young guy that's used to new technology thought it was too complicated to buy bitcoin in 2016 and beginning of 2017. Bought in december 2017 instead...",

            "Text": "I figured it out finally, how the USA is going to cripple bitcoin.\n\nThey are going to create a new 'crypto tax' in which every time you convert USD to crypto, they will tax it like a gas tax. So you will have to convert it to Euros first, and then try and go overseas. But if you do any in America, there will be a crypto tax. They will pass a law that ALL regulated conversion companies MUST collect and pass this tax in order to be a recognized banking institution, and all others who fail to comply will be investigated for 'providing money to terrorist organizations' and subsequently shut down.\n\nWhat this does is pretty crazy. It makes it MORE expensive to purchase the same things at home in the USA than with cash or debit cards, which will immediately stop the adoption of it by vendors.\n\nBanks win, the Government retains control, and people who want to have bitcoin for 'funzies' can still do so. Plus, new banking restrictions are in place and are very hard to get or you have to pay a really high fee for a 'banking permit' to sell and exchange BTC.\n\nEdit: yes, I do own bitcoin, and I fear for this kind of stuff.",

Trading based on running long and short positions is the worst thing you can do anyway.",

The shorts will go out of the market as the price heads toward the floor, and will come out when it gets closer to the ceiling. Here, the price is somewhat closer to the last recent high (8915 on March 23), than the last floor (6600 a couple of weeks ago), so it is natural that the shorts will increase.",

Judging by the volume it's more likely hesitation from the bulls since this is the third time they have been rejected from the 8200 mark. It seems everyone is counting on some big whale to come to their rescue and push prices up without really looking at the charts to form a second opinion. ",

Exchanges have welcomed this move.**\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About New York's New Inquiry\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchanges-saying-nys-new-inquiry/\n\nSome of the startups named today in the New York Attorney General's cryptocurrency exchange \"inquiry\" say they welcome the move.\n\nAs CoinDesk reported on Tuesday, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has launched an inquiry into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchanges named were Coinbase's GDAX, Gemini, bitFlyer USA, Bitfinex, Bitstamp USA, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance, Tidex.com, Gate.io, itBit and Huobi.Pro.\n\nSchneiderman's office sent letters to the exchanges, along with a detailed questionnaire that probes the firms' ownership, leadership, operations, terms of service, privacy policies, trading volumes, use of \"bots,\" relationships with financial institutions - among other areas.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to the 13 exchanges, and as of press time, five - Gemini, Bittrex, Poloniex, bitFlyer and Bitfinex - replied. Coinbase was not immediately available to comment, and the other exchanges have yet to respond to requests.\n\nIn a statement, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said his company \"applauds\" the Attorney General's inquiry, stating that \"we look forward to cooperating with and submitted our responses to the questionnaire.\"\n\n\"We continue to embrace thoughtful regulation and collaboration on our mission to help build the future of money,\" he added.\n\nA representative for Bittrex struck a similar note, also stating that the exchange welcomes the opportunity to respond: \"We look forward to working with NY Attorney General Schneiderman on our shared goal of improving transparency, accountability and security across all virtual currency trading platforms.\"\n\nJosh Hawkins, vice president of marketing at Circle, Poloniex's parent company, told CoinDesk:\n\n\"We welcome all initiatives focused on increasing transparency and accountability in the space and look forward to working with the New York Attorney General's office. Protecting crypto currency investors and consumers has always been Circle's first priority.\"\n\nBitFlyer USA, by way of compliance director Hailey Lennon, echoed the remarks about transparency, stating: \"Transparency is important for consumer protection in this industry. We received the letter from the New York Attorney General and are reviewing the requests asked of our US exchange.\"\n\nKasper Rasmussen, communications director for Bitfinex, offered a more measured comment when reached.\n\n\"We can confirm that Bitfinex is aware of the New York Attorney General's inquiry regarding our operations, controls, and general user protections. Bitfinex is committed to compliance with authorities and regulators worldwide and we look forward to responding to this inquiry.\"\n\nWhen reached for follow-up comment on the launch of its inquiry, a spokesperson for Schneiderman's office said that \"we plan to make the information public at the end of the process since the goal here is to bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the crypto marketplace.\"\n\nShe declined to \"comment or speculate\" about potential legal action against the exchanges.",
