            "Text": "My opinion on how we got here is on October 31st CME announces futures trading.  Institutional money knows they can exploit this feature on a major platform.  So they started buying up bitcoins until the FUD starts for segwit2x in middle November.  Segwit2x was an attempted takeover of the development team by major businesses in bitcoin such as the DCG bitpay and coinbase.\n\nAfter that fud passed the institutional money continued to buy.  This happened until a little after futures started going live on December 11th.  Later that week we hit the all time high and in my opinion this is when big money shorted bitcoin on CME and sold what they bought on the run up to 19k+.  This was a big move to make money and manipulate the market with the help of mainstream media and fomo.\n\nAfter a few months of shorts this is where we are.  We are near equilibrium with a lot more users, LN is live, and there's all kinds of great stuff going on in bitcoin.  \n\nI don't think the price will go much lower, but it can.  I think we'll start to see some calmness in the market as we grow.  Bitcoin is bigger and better than ever and this is a really exciting time. ",

            "Text": "I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.\n\nThe market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level and point in time. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.\n\nWhile sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. Plus, better margins for gains.\n\nAfter the worst crash this year to 6k at February 6th, we didn't see the 7k level again for weeks after the market had recovered and passed that price point. This doesn't mean that we can't see a worsening of the market, I just wouldn't bet on it.\n\nThis is merely my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.\n",

I'm  sure many of you have had some of these thoughts and there is good literature out there, so looking forward to learning a bit today about node network mechanics. ",

I didn't see [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7N1fZ6pT/) happening in real time 'cause I was busy with bbq ribs but now that I see what happened it looks like all those predictions about 3.5-4k within the end of the month may be utterly wrong by a long shot. We know it's a manipulated market and we got used to pumps but that one looks quite odd to me. And not because of how much it pumped the price, which is pretty normal by btc standards. It's not a matter of how much but *where*. It happened after the long term trendline was confirmed broken [two hourly candles below the line] and it got us back into the \"safe\" zone. To me it doesn't look like it was an ordinary pump. It was a rescue.\n\n/back to bbq",

But shorting at low price levels and hoping for a complete crash just isn't a healthy mindset, and there will be risks with such behavior.",

            "Text": "The market has been hard to read lately and while I don't want to speculate on particular price levels right now, I would be careful to bet on dropping prices. It may happen, we just don't know the likelihood and it would be a pure gamble. Not all cards are on the table and the market is still in recovery mode. Unexpected bullruns can show up instantly and reverse a drop when people expect the market to sink.\n\nThose that have already sold without exiting the market will generally predict low prices with absolute certainty since they seek to re-enter at a lower price with profit. This is understandable. However, when people make dead certain predictions like that, I tend to call bluff. A more nuanced observation is generally more realistic.",

Study the charts, too. (I like the charts on GDAX) With the charts in front of you, make pretend trades. See if they would have worked. Note why they did or didn't work. Learn from your 'mistakes' or 'successes'. You should have a lot of pretend positive trades under your belt before you make your first real one. When you finally do trade, start very small (using money you can afford to lose) and increase your trade sizes as your successes increase. Remember: buy low sell high.

            "Text": "Right. Plus, when whales play poker they keep most of their cards hidden.\n\nAfter a crash, some whales have a tendency to buy low, sell at a chosen high point, wait for the price to drop and then push up again with force to a new higher peak, confusing the market with a sudden burst that catches people off-guard when they were thinking the price was dropping.\n\nWhen whales battle, the smaller fish, such as most of us, may want to wait out the results before making drastic, rash decisions. Small fish like myself tend to have better odds at higher altitudes where the market is generally easier to read.",

I would believe that these sharp spikes recently are shorts covering,  but they are in no panic to cover.   Any short positions of significance were likely taken in the mid teens down to maybe 10K,  they are very safe positions.  Every now and then a short decide's they need to cash out,  so they buy, with abandon, to cover their short.\n\nAlso,  it is VERY difficult to short bitcoin,  no matter how you try,  there is always some very real risk of a breakdown somewhere in the chain.   The fear of getting stuck in a bad trade due to an exchange failure is too much for many.  Shorting bitcoin,  even at 15K,  takes big balls.  ",

The decision is pretty simple,  which history do you look at to try and decide?   If you use bitcoin's previous history,  you believe a bull run is probably and soon.  If you use the Internet's stock price history,  you believe there are no more bull runs,  just slow (or 0 or neg)  growth.\n\nTL;DR  most shorts are not panicking , don't expect a miracle 'short squeeze'\n",
