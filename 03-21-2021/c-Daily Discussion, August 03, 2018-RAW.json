It\u2019s their old asses that need custodian accounts. \n\nWe got Trezors, ledgers and the list grows. These old heads gotta retire and stop spreading FUD. No own uses custodial accounts with bitcoin. Lol!!\n\nWallstreet will be taken over by more educated and powerful generation shortly and hopefully this bullshit these old guys make up dues with them. \n\nAnyone fooled by them, deserves to be left behind for not listening to their nephew or niece over old retired people who can\u2019t turn on a computer.

            "Text": "There is simply no catalyst motivating a move to the upside.  There is no reason for people to buy Bitcoin.  And every day you have your money parked in Bitcoin it isn't in the market, and with stock prices skyrocketing, the FOMO is over in AAPL and AMZN, not BTC.\n\nI've thought for some time that the real motivating reason for Bitcoin is not a hedge against collapsing conventional currencies.  That's what precious metals are for.  The purpose, maybe the *only* purpose, of BTC is to hedge against shifting domestic financial regulations and to bridge between inconsistent financial regulations across national borders.  If a Chinese millionaire wants to move money to dollars but domestic Chinese regulations limit the amount or rate at which he can expropriate his money, BTC provides a way to do that.  You can argue that this is breaking the law, but the legal waters become unclear when we are dealing with transnational activity between two different regulatory paradigms.  This is some of what motivates the explosion of prices in the art world for artworks that only every sit in storage units just outside of the customs fences at ports.  They aren't interested in art, they are interested in moving wealth on their own terms.\n\nBut China's economy is slowing, as is the rest of asia's, so this activity is also slowing.  furthermore authorities have gotten wise to this play, and it doesn't always work.\n\nSo unless there is a reason or reasons for people to want to buy bitcoin.  It isn't going up.  And if there is a better place to make money e.g. apple stock or the S&P500, then people are going to sell what BTC they have to participate in those other markets.\n\nWe need a catalyst.  But there isn't one.",

The better question is why do you think it will crash when it's been going for nine years and only growing. \n\nPersonally I don't see it crashing at all, in fact I see it getting substantially larger. The thing about all of the big movements we have seen. Personal computer. The internet. Things like that. At the beginning, the majority of society doubts them and sees them as a gimmick. They don't understand how it will be useful. As time goes on people come to accept it as it eventually starts making sense to them and you have a more consumer-friendly use case. The pc for example. In the early days of Dos programming, what good was that for someone? What use case did it have? You starting to see fragments of change in the 80s when you add basic games being programmed. Some of the first spreadsheets. Some actual use case situations. The general public still did not actually accept the home computer for another 10 plus years",

As I write, that value is 7.4k USD per.\n\n>Is it valuable because the payment network cannot be controlled by the government? \n\nTo an extent, I believe this is the case.\n\n>As much benefit there is in this attribute, wouldn't this would also be it's main flaw in becoming a replacement for government fiat?\n\nIn contrast, many of us believe that this would be its main **feature**.\n\n>Sure, Apple can come out the winner by not giving in to government surveillance, but there's simply no way the government would just let bitcoin take over. \n\nThe government's ability to stop cryptocurrency is limited to a degree by the extent to which they are willing to deny citizens the right to do mathematics and share their results.\n\n\n> Further more, even if the government did allow that to happen, why would people want that? Why would people not want some governing entity to control money? \n\n\"Fiat\" is, roughly, the Latin for \"by law.\" This type of currency is backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the government issuing it. This means that monetary policy can be set by politicians who think it is a good idea to print more money when they run out. There is no asset of \"real value\" backing it.\n\nIf you want an example of what happens when the illusion falls apart, take a look at what sloppy monetary policy did to Venezuela. They measure their cash by weight now. Children use bundles of banknotes as building bricks. You go out with a grocery bag full of money to buy a loaf of bread and some eggs.\n\nEverything is relative, and you may be surprised to know that crypto has become a sort of shelter from inflation there. When you are losing 100000% per year sitting on your cash because of inflation, 70% losses are nothing.\n\n>There is a lot greater risk of corruption of having money uncontrolled, than there is having it controlled by the government - I think. \n\nOn the contrary, I believe corruption arises when only a select few are above the law. When **everyone** is above the law, it will be a different story. It will be scary. It will be dangerous and exciting.\n\nBut there is no use avoiding it because I believe it is inevitable.\n\nGood questions. Hope I provided some answers.\n\n",

For the price of a thing to rise, the demand needs to increase or the supply needs to contract.  The supply isn't contracting.  The demand is falling.  What more do you need.\n\nStop with this standard of value nonsense.  The dollar off the gold standard has served as a standard of value for decades.  The entire population of the earth has doubled since w3e've been off the gold standard.  You don't need a reference material, you just need an tacit agreement to use a medium of exchange whose supply does not wildly fluctuate and you have a stable store of value.  Stop visiting the von mises blogs, they are messing with your head.  And they are bad economics.",

In the weekend two days. The fees on paypal and my credit card are very high. It's an outdated system. I'm not even talking about the altcoins. They could solve many many real life problems, for example corruption when money from ngos is directly wired to the ones who need it instead of passing through corrupt governments. You'll say 'but they can use a bankaccount'. That's the problem, 2 billion people don't have a bank account, the only way to reah them is through crypto and mobile phone. Many other things: reducing energy costs with something like power ledger, where people can trade energy together, reducing many many other costs. This will be the biggest revolution since the internet. The moment cryptos are gong to be adopted by the mainstream, you'll see big big changes. Within a couple of years, governments are going to actually stimulate cryptos and cryptocompanies. , because it's going to take the ecoomy to another level, it's going to make it way, way more efficient. It's also going to elevate the standard of living in thrid world countries. For the first time, they will have the opportunity to enter a global financial market, as equals. Tremendous advantages. BTC will be the digital gold. It doesn't need to be a stable coin, there are other coins. Each will have its own function. You need to read some whitepapers, then your eyes will open. The knowledge will trickle down to society. ",

In fact I don't find it surprising in the least and I find it completely logical.\n\nIt's also the reason why so many people can't make it in the market. Like I have said in a couple of other replies to you if we look at the market since 2009 you have had all of these crazy events happen. Logical people that just think well if this happens maybe I should do this would have made the wrong choice at multiple turns. We have the luxury of History. We have the luxury of being able to get a feel for how this Market works. The people in 2013 did not have that and there was real fear this whole thing was going to zero. \n\nI think most people if they had a 70% loss would definitely think there is a problem and would definitely want to run. Back in 2008 the Dow lost around 50%. I distinctly remember people telling me it was going to continue lower and questioning if we were going to have a decade-long Great Depression. 50% losses or something the average person gets very concerned over. Me on the other hand? I went balls deep with every dollar I had. \n\nThis is just the nature of human emotion. It's also why Wall Street firms are able to take dollars away from amateur Traders so easily. They are very aware of the emotional decision making process the average person has.\n\nMost people are wired backwards. In December and January when the market was making high after high and going straight up you should have been terrified selling everything you had. Now when the market is holding lows and we see this $6,000 area as support it should make you greedy and want to buy.\n\nI'm putting my money where my mouth is with all of this by the way and I'm doing it with a stock as well as crypto. Dsx. It's a Greek Shipping Company. Peaked over the $30 in 2008. It's trading $4 and change right now and I'm accumulating. I'm not going to write multiple paragraphs on why I'm doing it but if you just look at the price action it would scare the bejesus out of the average person and it's making me greedy. ",

Very few people really could visualize the future of the internet and computers. It does not surprise me at all when I read comments in here or elsewhere really of people who just don't get it and can't visualize where it's going.

            "Text": "That's actually a really good attitude to have. When you put on any trade thinking about how it's going to go wrong is generally better than hoping it will go right. \n\nLike I said earlier I think it is going to continue to grow and we are still in the middle of a very long trend. If that is not the case the only way it's really going to fail is with a series of negative events. Even if the lightning Network somehow stalls and does not improve that does not necessarily mean Bitcoin is going to die even though it may go flat or go down. It would really take something like the collective governments of the world Banning it entirely to really collapse the value and even then it would probably still be used by some. \n\nThe realistic bear scenario is rooted in how emotional so many people are. Have you ever read political discussions or seen someone comment on crime. Ever notice you usually read a whole paragraph of stupid. People that are not thinking through their comments. We should kill every child molester period ever heard that one? Never mind that sex crimes are often convicted on less evidence than anything else and often on just testimony which would lead to a situation of people being killed on rumors. They don't think about that part and what I'm getting at is the same thing plays out in markets. When people start feeling really pessimistic about something the logic doesn't matter sometimes at least not for awhile. What matters is how they feel. Right now the sentiment on crypto is pretty bad. A lot of people have simply given up. If there is ever a collective moment where people decide there is no value in crypto that could be a major problem. Do I think it's likely or probable? No but it is possible\n\n\nPersonally I think the cat is out of the bag with cryptocurrency and there's no putting it back in\n\nKeep learning, keep researching, watch quality people like andres annapolis. Read their books. A lot of us have a lightbulb moment at some point where it all starts to make sense even if we were doubters initially",

            "Text": "Yeah that's not really true man. Let's take a look at some other inflated markets. We had the tech boom. We had the market crash in 2008. We had the gold bubble. These are also different markets. If we rewind back to 2013 Bitcoin went from $20 to $1,000 in a year. It was totally manipulated too. There were some damn bots on Mount gox making that happen. Market crashes but the lowest Bitcoin ever went was like a hundred and sixty bucks and the real low was more like 200 bucks. That's where it hung out for a little while. That's 10 x from where it started and it was all built on bullshit. \n\n2017 began a little over $1,000 and while we didn't get quite as lucky this time with a 10x we're not really doing all that bad with a 5700 low. Now obviously we did not have milk ducts blow up which is a very good thing but we did have a lot of people buying this on their credit cards and second mortgages on their house and all kinds of crazy crap. Now those people got liquidated. After that we have the second set of sellers. The depressed crowd I like to call them. Now they bought in and expected things to go higher and that didn't happen so they sell. Finally you have the fake strong hands. The people that think I can hold on to this. Then eventually there comes a Tipping Point where they just lose it and think Bitcoin is doomed and they finally sell. I've been around markets for awhile so this particular psychological cycle does not scare me. \n\nLet's look at some facts. The lightning network is increasing and usefulness at a very rapid pace. Each month we are further ahead than we were before. We are seeing multiple institutions talking about custody Solutions and getting involved in the game to some degree. We have a market that is valued at one hell of a lot more money than it was in the beginning of 2017. \n\nI'm sorry but your comment is actually extremely bullish because I can tell you're a pretty intelligent guy and you have a great Post history and you seem to be fairly intellectual . when people like you shift from Hope to doubt that is like the Golden Cross to me. That is what I have seen time and time again around Market bottoms. Now I'm not saying we are definitely at the bottom but that trait, and I've seen it with more people than just you is extremely common around bottoms. \n\nIf the cycle plays out totally textbook the next phase we should go into is disbelief. The market will slowly grind higher and you will see the lows hold on pullbacks. The majority of people will doubt it and keep talking about when it's going to roll over. The difference this time is that won't happen. You never really know where the bottom is until after you have made it but there are some really good signs that tell you you might be around one.",

            "Text": "Alright so there are a couple of things going on here. The first one you have to be aware of or the cycles. You can see this if you look at a 10-year history of the company. Imagine an oscillator. That's how this stock trades. There is something called the Baltic dry index which in layman's terms is what they can charge for shipping. The higher that goes the higher the day rate becomes on the ships. Now if you look at the really big picture on the Baltic dry index in 2016 it bottomed at a lower level than it was trading in the 90s. During the last major cycle which was 2003 to 2009 metals and bulk shipping did really well because China was clicking off at 10% GDP every year. Same with the Emerging Markets. That all crashed along with the housing crisis and a lot of these shipping companies had ships they could not pay for and no one wanting to Charter them. You look at the earnings of a couple of the good names like DSX and ssw and you see them burning money. They were not making any profit. Now back to that Baltic dry index. If you look at 2016 until today you see that series of higher lows. Now you look at the earnings of DSX they went from losing ass loads of money to breaking even with a small profit on this last earnings report. Now you look at the share price. We had to run up to a little over $5 and now we are correcting back down. You have a company with improving earnings and a share price that hasn't really caught on yet. Where is the risk? It's in the macro. If we have a recession or if we have drastically slowing Global growth it could be a negative. However it's extremely unlikely we are going to get anywhere near 2016 levels again. A lot of the ships and over supply have been scrapped or sold. When you look at the rest of Wall Street and some of the high earnings multiples on companies that have been doing well for years I just don't really see the value. I mean people are paying 17 times earnings for Heinz. Yes like ketchup. What I'm doing in a nutshell with DSX is selling parabolic rallies and buying support. The level we are at right now I'm nibbling. I'm not 100% sure if I would say this is a bottom because we don't have any signs of it but again if we look at that chart you see that run up off of a clear double bottom. Now we have the correction. It might do a Fibonacci retracements or it might just be a regular Cup & handle retracement before the next stage takes off. What we don't want to see is the price get back down into the mid 3s. That would be full circle. If we go down to $4 flat to where we are now that is just a good healthy correction. Again the risk is macro. If we have slowing GDP into the back half of the year which is a pretty reasonable possibility it could put a limit on this particular stock but then again a nice horizontal trend is really easy to trade. If you look at the macd right now you will see the histogram trading up which is a bullish Divergence couple that in with the price action and where we are on the oscillator. It just seems like a reasonable time to accumulate a little more so I bought another hundred shares this morning and will keep watching the price action. The worst case scenario is stopping out about 3.90 or cost averaging in the whole way down and waiting for the next cycle. When China starts to accelerate again this thing could really go to town because dry bulk shipping is things like iron ore. Copper etc",

            "Text": "Is that possible? Absolutely. Is it probable? I certainly don't think so because there are a couple of situations that would make that happen. The first one is people in droves losing interest. That's not happening. The news is actually very positive. Searches are starting to trickle up again. I think a lot of the people who got burned in January are going to be very hesitant but what is going to kill these people a second time is they are going to sit on the sidelines and wait and watch and when things start going again and increasing they are going to start to fomo in after we have already had a substantial price rise. When we take it out $20,000 you will see people come out of the woodwork. I have no idea how high we are going to go on the next cycle but I think a million is very optimistic. 40 to 50000 is what I would call a low Target and 100,000 is what I would call a high Target. If you look at all of the run-ups we have had since 2009 the percentage increase keeps shrinking as the dollar amount keeps increasing. \n\n2020 is when the next Bitcoin halving happens. After that event takes place you're going to have half the amount of new coins on the market everyday. That is going to create a scarce vacuum as the months go on just like it has in the past",
