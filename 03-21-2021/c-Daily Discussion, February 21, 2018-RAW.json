            "Text": "According to Investopedia: What is 'Capitulation'\nCapitulation is when investors give up any previous gains in stock prices by selling equities, to get out of the market. Capitulation involves extremely high volume and sharp declines. It also usually involves panic selling. The term is a derived from a military term which refers to surrender.\n\nBREAKING DOWN 'Capitulation'\nAfter capitulation selling, many traders think there are bargain buying opportunities. The belief is that everyone who wants to sell a stock for any reason, including forced selling due to margin calls, has already sold. The price should then, theoretically, reverse or bounce off the lows. In other words, some investors believe that capitulation is the sign of a bottom.\n\nInvestors can only identify capitulations after they have occurred. While traders often attempt to anticipate capitulation selling or buying, the reality is that capitulations are outcomes that result from the maximum psychological and financial pain that can be endured by investors before liquidating their positions. (To learn more, see: Profiting From Panic Selling.)\n\nUsing Technical Analysis to Identify Capitulations\nCapitulations often signal major turning points in the price action of underlying securities and financial instruments. Technical analysts can visually identify capitulation using candlestick charts. Hammer candles often form at the end of a selling frenzy when the lowest price is made, as capitulation sets in and signals a price bottom followed by a reversal bounce on heavy volume. Traders who wanted to sell their positions have done so as panic reached a climax. As fear starts to subside, greed may set in and reverse prices.\n\n\n\nRead more: Capitulation Definition | Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitulation.asp#ixzz57mC5w98n \nFollow us: Investopedia on Facebook",

            "Text": "According to Investopedia: What is 'Capitulation' Capitulation is when investors give up any previous gains in stock prices by selling equities, to get out of the market. Capitulation involves extremely high volume and sharp declines. It also usually involves panic selling. The term is a derived from a military term which refers to surrender.\nBREAKING DOWN 'Capitulation' After capitulation selling, many traders think there are bargain buying opportunities. The belief is that everyone who wants to sell a stock for any reason, including forced selling due to margin calls, has already sold. The price should then, theoretically, reverse or bounce off the lows. In other words, some investors believe that capitulation is the sign of a bottom.\nInvestors can only identify capitulations after they have occurred. While traders often attempt to anticipate capitulation selling or buying, the reality is that capitulations are outcomes that result from the maximum psychological and financial pain that can be endured by investors before liquidating their positions. (To learn more, see: Profiting From Panic Selling.)\nUsing Technical Analysis to Identify Capitulations Capitulations often signal major turning points in the price action of underlying securities and financial instruments. Technical analysts can visually identify capitulation using candlestick charts. Hammer candles often form at the end of a selling frenzy when the lowest price is made, as capitulation sets in and signals a price bottom followed by a reversal bounce on heavy volume. Traders who wanted to sell their positions have done so as panic reached a climax. As fear starts to subside, greed may set in and reverse prices.\nRead more: Capitulation Definition | Investopedia [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitulation.asp#ixzz57mC5w98n](http://crypto-calendars.com/) Follow us: Investopedia on Facebook",

            "Text": "The best thing about Bitcoin is that right now whatever price you buy at, it will go either up or down. I bought at a high of $11,729. It dropped to around $10,200. The major cause 0f these crashes is PANIC. That is the only reason it has such extreme dips. Plus GDAX should do a better job executing the trades to the penny. As all of you have seen, the trading board should not sit for 5-10 minutes. This fuels an explosion. Plus they are executing trades at higher and lower rates than what BTC is at. The good thing about panic selling is that it clears the way for the next high. I base my buying and selling on the order book zoomed out to $10. A good flat vertical sign on the buy or sell side is a very good indicator of when to buy and sell. I call these $5 or $10 vertical lines soldiers. Price  right now $10,835 and not enough green verticals to go higher. Yup now at $10,797. Hope this helps. A lot of sellers and buyers making huge mistakes without looking at this verticals. Remember not to invest more than you can lose. It looks like we may wake up tomorrow at 10.9 or 11K, Good luck everyone.  ",

But it just takes one fuck up to lose a huge chunk of money that way. There was a guy who posted on here a few months ago saying that he lost over $200k from daytrading.\n\n\nThe smartest and easiest approach is to buy and hodl, aka invest for the long term.  Which is what any financial expert would tell you about anything.",

            "Text": "1. Counterparty posts an old state, where you had less coins than in the newest state. You're offline and don't notice for X hours (X is determined by the channel state - both sides agree on it in advance).\n\n2. You try and steal counterparty's coins, they publish a breach remedy tx and take your coins as well.\n\n3. You lose the keys, including those to the channel's output, so regardless of how it is closed you cannot spend your output. You also cannot sign a new state so the channel must be closed. There's multiple subsets of which keys you can lose, but they're all derived from a master key so it's unlikely that you lose only a subset.\n\nYou can also forget you have a channel (lose the channel state) so when it closes you don't know. If you still remember that you used to have coins on-chain you can follow them to find the channel. I guess you can also get hit by a bus, in which case you might be considered as having lost your coins.",

            "Text": "> ... not even know if it is the same wallet since each time we get a new address? \n\nThis is plain wrong. Each wallet is exactly one address. Wallet and address are two words for the same thing. I think you might be confounding exchange accounts with bitcoin wallets. Exchanges might indeed give you several addresses for transactions with your account.\n\nSo yes, nobody really knows which of the early addresses (wallets) belong to Satoshi, but odds are high that most of the very first addresses which were never moved do belong to him (or other early adopters who lost their keys...).\n\n> one can trace the movement of a bitcoin (or parts of it?) since it was generated on the blockchain network\n\nThis is true. As a matter of fact, you can build a precise graph of every single fraction of a bitcoin from the beginning to now. The graph would have nodes (wallets) and transactions (arrows). \n\nImagine you receive 0.5 BTC in your wallet (address), then you send 0.2 BTC to one address and 0.1 BTC to another address. In the graph this would be one arrow going into your node and two arrows out of your node. The complete BTC transaction history can be drawn like this.\n\nSo anonymity in BTC is not very strong. As soon as someone (police investigators etc.) can establish that a certain address (wallet) is yours, they can trace all your transactions to and from other wallets. Example: the police discovers that you own address xyz because you payed a pizza with that wallet and they analyzed the pizza shop's transaction history where your name and address is pegged to that transaction because of delivery. They also know that a well-known drug dealer owns address zxy. If there is a transaction of 2.5 BTC from xyz to zxy in the blockchain, then they know you sent money to the drug dealer. Hope you never did that, because this information is there now, and will be there forever. \n\n> each satoshi has something like a serial number\n\nNo. There is no such thing as single satoshis. If you receive 0.2 BTC and then 0.4 BTC, you will have 0.6 BTC in your wallet, and if you then send 0.1 BTC, there is no way to tell if those 0.1 came from the 0.2 or from the other 0.4, just like in a bank account. There are no coins, just wallets and balances.\n \n> sending BTC to wrong addresses \n\nyou can't send BTC to any random number, but if you do send BTC to the wrong address, then it's gone for good, yes. Someone else  will enjoy that coins then, given they didn't lose their keys...\n",

Bitcoin will hit the real bottom when all is lost, when even this subreddit is claiming the end of bitcoin and everyone is way too scared to buy in. The last huge run up to 1100 years ago didn't crash at the bottom until about 200. In the time when it was 200, even I was scared to buy bitcoin and only bought one near the bottom. This subreddit was a graveyard and mainstream news didn't touch bitcoin for years. Sure I could be wrong, but this last week just has felt like a classic pump and dump.",

            "Text": "It really depends on the trading strategy you use as well. If you just throw it all in on what you assume is a dip, you will hit a point where you guessed wrong, and either have to sell at a loss or hodl until the price comes back up.\n\nIf you plan on doing several small orders as it goes up and down and keep some capital in reserve to handle the dips, you have to take minimum order size into account. On GDAX it is currently .001 btc which is just under $11. Unless they changed it since i checked last. So $50 would limit you to only having 4 concurrent orders out at current minimum order size.",

            "Text": "When people say 'wallet', they often refer to deterministic wallets, which generate multiple addresses, or just plain collections of addresses (your wallet.dat file, before HD, contained a bunch of private keys, or addresses, or 'wallets')\n\nIf you don't reuse addresses, then there can be no two transactions sent from the same address - you spend all (1) outputs to that address when you spend from it. That's slightly stronger anonymity, but it still breaks often (f.e. whoever gave you your coins might know all the addresses you received coins from them in)\n\nIf you receive 0.2BTC in one tx and then 0.4BTC in another, and then spend 0.1BTC, it is possible to see which of the two outputs were spent.\n\nYou can send BTC to a 'wrong' address for which no one knows the private key - it was not lost if no one had it to begin with. The chances of randomly typing a wrong but valid address is small, and with bech32 it is minuscule.",

            "Text": "$2,000,000 is a reasonable lower bound. Two ways to get there: taking the size of the global bond market with risk-adjusted yield below GDP growth, adding to that the size of gold and other wealth storage, and most global currencies.\n\nNow of course, with competition by bitcoin, yields will be higher so this isn't an equilibrium but the first order estimate gets you well above $2,000,000.\n\nOr, take projections of the total savings rate. How much of your income would you want to save as insurance? Globally, this is about 80-160% of GDP (so about a year's worth of income, which makes intuitive sense). If people saved in Bitcoin rather than property, gold, bank accounts, bonds, etc, bitcoin's price would be >$2,000,000 each.\n\nThis is all conditional on Bitcoin succeeding by not getting hacked, governments not banning it, etc.",

You're talking as if casual exposure to crypto will somehow turn people away from it, but that's exactly what is needed to present it as more than unregulated internet stocks on crack.

Banks don\u2019t have fees this high at their ATMs for a multitude of reasons - but mostly because they net Billions of dollars in revenue from other channels. ATMs save banks money by allowing them to pay fewer salaries. The ATM isnt the product - the banking services are. Where as Bitcoin ATMs ARE the product. The ATM IS the service - and using them comes at a direct cost.\n\nThat\u2019s the difference and I hope youre able to grasp it. ",
