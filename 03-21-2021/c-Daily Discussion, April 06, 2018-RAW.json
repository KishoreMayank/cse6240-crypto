It's some synthetic representation of buy interest vs sell interest, total hocum IMHO.\n\nA short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange, and sell it immediately.\nYou have to give that share back to the exchange at some point. When the price goes down, you buy a share on the open market, return it to the exchange 'covering your short'. You sell high, and buy low so you profit, instead of the reverse, buy low sell high.\n\n* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.\n* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share. Only the better exchange clients are approved to short typically.\n* Exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.\n* The only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees, which in a short sale is a double whammy, the exchange is guaranteed two fees.\n\nNow in the unregulated crypto markets, the exchanges are NOT required to report coins lent for short sale.\n\nFactor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading, (options are NOT short selling). They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option, hence little short interest was observed.\n\nTo a professional short seller, little short interest in a market in an obvious speculative bubble was a dream come true, and they borrowed and sold, crashing the market.\n",

            "Text": "I think there is an equilibrium of sorts.  Run of the mill bulls and bears tussle at the current equilibrium,  then a large short is covered,  and the equilibrium is upset,  but eventually returns.\n\nWhat really sucks for you guys is that one of the most important pieces of information you need to at least have a fighting chance to day trade,  you don't have!  \n\nHow many coins have the exchanges lent to short sellers?   How many have been returned (shorts covered)?  How fast is the ratio between the two changing,  etc.  You need to know that if you are going to succeed as a small investor in a big pond with big (shorting) fish.\n\nYou don't know because crypto exchanges are not required to report it.   The SEC figured out a long time ago that not reporting short sales was disadvantageous to the small investor,  and they regulated it.   \n\nI have now formed a new opinion,  BTCUSDSHORT on bitfinex (the exchange that recently stepped in major dog doo, another thread),  is an attempt to divert attention away from their short lending practices.   If a noob somehow stumbles across the concept of shorting and asks,  bitfinex has an answer , \"short interest,  ah, here's this index we cooked up,  it has the word short in it,  this IS the droid you are looking for!\".  It is not.\n\nSo ,  there is really no way to predict where things might go, everyone is flying blind.  Also keep in mind,  TA evolved 100% in the age of short sale disclosure requirements.  Applying TA to a market that is not transparent regarding short sales is probably not going to work,  IMHO.\n\nGood luck everyone,  I think you'll need it!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Everyone has a handle, figure it out, use it, and spread awareness.\n\nApparently this is why the gun debate always looses in America, cuz we win on the home front. Now I can neither confirm nor deny, but it sounds palusible.\n\nAny exposure is good exposure is good exposure, stickers, posters graffiti, porn. You name it, get on it. Don't worry about what they say or their laughter, if you just keep hounding the point home they will eventually see things your way. (Usually at the next ATH unfortunately)\n\nI'm not saying to scam them of course, educate them on the risks and make sure they don't go all in, but make sure they either buy, or discuss it with the next person. That is the only way we can prevail..numbers.",

The number of shorts is insanely high, which means that if the price starts to rise, the shorts will be squeezed (they need to buy back asap or risk a price that is continuing to escalate out of control - similar to what was seen in late 2017).  The fact that so many short positions have been opened (6K coins shorted in last 2 days) while the price of bitcoin has been steady is very bullish.  When price starts to rise, these 6K coins will need to be purchased (32,780 coins in total).",

I think a lot of the action attributed to' whales' is really pro shorts selling then buying to cover.  \n\nEverytime a redditor claims 'it's a pump, don't fall for it,  bull trap',  a professional short has likely just covered.  They play big,  so it's easy to see when you know what you are looking at.",

Whales have a big ass room full of screens and people who will all pump and dump at the same time on every exchange. They then monitor to see how the market repsponds then make their next move. The big ass volume bars are from whales buying a shit ton when they see that all orders are pretty cheap. Then when they see people having orders that they would pay allot for coins. They dump. There is no need for them to use bots, they have a better chance making money with trading organizations. Noone would trust millions to a bot. They are highly organized, that's why most people seem to keep losing to the markets manipulation. Somehow the market is always against them. The whales actually are working hard, they are monitoring every buy/sell orders and strategizing. I guess people would like to think it's bots to make them feel better about losing their money.",

Even in real estate - you don't buy the best house in the worst neighbourhood, you buy the worst house in the best neighbourhood. You buy cheap and ugly. You buy when buying isn't sexy. You vulture the stock when nobody wants it. When people call you an idiot for doing so. That's when you know it's the right time to buy. \n\nWhen I bought more in early 2015 after the big 2014 crash my friends laughed at me for buying something which had just lost 80% of its value. Bitcoin was dying. Dead. A lost cause. That's how I knew it was the perfect time to buy. ",

            "Text": "so true and can't argue with somebody who's been in way longer than me.  3 years ago I was a newbie to investing in general.  I finally had some extra money and bought great stocks Amazon 350, BABA at 70, Apple at 90, Facebook 75, Visa 64, Boeing 125 and a few others.  Unfortunately i panic sold after 6 months and wound up losing about 4 grand.  Since then I've watched those stocks go on to double and more.  After learning that lesson I decided that any extra money was better spent on paying down my mortgage as stocks were getting too high and i thought pre-paying my mortgage was the safest bet (even though I know many ppl disagree).  \n\nAnyway fast forward to May 2017 and Bitcoin popped up on my radar.  I didn't understand it when I originally heard about it in 2013 but for some reason it started to interest me last May and i dug into the tech, significance etc.  It became super obvious to start accumulating and I swore to myself I will not panic sell and my time frame is a minimum 1-4years.  Who knew the first year would be the hardest, but i don't see any reason why it won't eventually surpass last ATH, perhaps its this year.",

It's some synthetic representation of buy interest vs sell interest,  total hocum.\n\nA short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange,  and sell it immediately.\n\nYou have to give that share back to the exchange at some point.  When the price goes down,  you buy a share on the open market,  return it to the exchange 'covering your short'.  You sold high,  and bought low so you profit,  instead of the opposite,  buy low sell high.\n\n* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.\n* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share.  Only the better ecchange clients are approved to short typically.\n* exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.\n* the only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees,  which in a short sale is a double whammy,  the exchange is guaranteed TWO fees.\n\nNow in the unregulated crypto markets,  the exchanges are NOT required to do anything!\n\nNow factor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading,  (options are NOT short selling).  They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option,  hence LITTLE SHORT interest was observed.\n\nTo a professional short seller,  little short interest in a market in an obvious speculative bubble was a dream come true,  and they borrowed and sold, crashing the market.  \n\n",

Who in their right mind would try to get away with that?\n\nThere is nothing illegal about not paying your taxes so long as you pay the penalty and interest to the IRS.  It happens a lot in bankruptcy proceedings,  large estates that go to probate,  weird stuff like that. \n\n|Also, how the hell could you spend 30k that fast.\n\nHere is a scenario illustrating to don't have to spend a penny\n\nYou buy bitcoin early in 2017 worth $1000\n\nLater it is worth $10,000,  so you do what a lot of early 'traders' did,  sell 10% of your holdings to recoup your initial investment,  and you now have $9,000 in bitcoin profit that is your 'further investment money',  (you think).  So you take your bitcoins and start trading them into alt coins.  Before 2017 ends,  you have a diversified portfolio,  %25 BTC,  10% ??? ....   whatever.\n\nSo that means you sold 75% of your bitcoin when you traded it for your alt coin portfolio.\n\nUncle Sam will tax those sales.\n\nSo Now it's 2018,  and you realize you own tax on more than the 10% sale to fiat,  you own tax on the 75% (of the remaining 90%) to traded into alts.\n\nYour tax bill is larger than you expected,  and you don't have the cash to pay those taxes,  so you have to sell NOW regardless,  because you are SO afraid of being in debt to the IRS!\n",

Banks around the world are starting to prevent crypto transactions and ceasing services to anyone involved in crypto. Tax laws are taking any potential profits and the disdain for crypto in the general public is palpable. No one outside of crypto is interested. In fact quite the opposite now. I\u2019m guessing if everything stays just as it is today with no further preventative / prohibitive regulations this will eventually go to $1k bounce back to $2k, down to $500 then $0.1, there will be no December bull run.

Spreading FUD should be done with subtlety not forcefully as you're doing it. You fail. \n\nAbout the usefulness and importance of bitcoin - read this first link here: https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html (Explain Bitcoin Like I'm Five). Bitcoin is basically a material digital asset and that's what's revolutionary about it. If you don't see it, you don't see it. Too bad for you. What it enables (independent and permissionless transfer and storage of value) is important today and it will get even more important with time - especially once paper money/cash is abolished. Without bitcoin (or some other autonomous cryptocurrency) we'll then be living in a world, where ALL our transactions are recorded, meaning in a world of totalitarian surveillance. Fuck that.\n\n \n\n",
