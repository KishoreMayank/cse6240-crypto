I sold right before it crashed at around $15,200. I\u2019m not gonna lie to you, I forgot about bitcoin after I sold and saw the trend turning super bearish. I didn\u2019t think about getting back in until I saw a bitcoin meme on /all yesterday. I\u2019ve been doing basic research just looking at the price history charts for bitcoin. I noticed that at many times throughout its history, bitcoin has fallen around 69-71% at most between ATH and the lowest point following the recovery from said ATH. You can look up the charts and see the same thing. I\u2019m not saying you should be excited but every time it hit -70ish percent after a crash it *always* went back up to a new ATH. We went from around $19,343 to a low of around $5,800 recently. I\u2019m not saying you should be bullish but in my opinion (which shouldn\u2019t mean shit) bitcoin is already going to go on the up and up. Based on the fact that throughout its history whenever it went to a low of -71% it went back up. Just throwing that out there. Want to know what you guys think. ",

You're all acting like financial advisors, when in reality most of you probably know fuck all about financial markets. The mainstream media and newbie investors might take bitcoin a bit more seriously if you'd get off your high-horses and have a bit of damn humility.  \n>  \n>Having an opinion is good. Discussing your opinion in a calm, reasoned and constructive way is really good - it can help people develop their understanding of what is still a *very* experimental and uncertain technology. But pretending you have a crystal ball and encouraging people to risk money on the back of propaganda is fucking douchey.  \n>  \n>I for one will only listen to predictions if OP is willing to re-mortgage his house and bet every penny to his name on his forecast.

Most institutional stock investors are waiting to see how the levels hold above 6k and since they have been doing well, we can expect several hundred million coming in per day. I can't say where my friend works (except in a few years they might change their name to bitcoinman sax lol) and they have TONS of investors just in their one department that are liquidating their old-school investments (stocks, bonds, CDs, and mutual funds) and going ALL IN on crypto. I talked to him about bcash and he said that nobody on his team was going to invest in it since it's a huge scam by the traitor roger ver, and most people were interested ONLY in bitcoin.\n\nEdit: He also said that a LOT of people in the industry are upset with Jamie Diamond because he was hurting cryptocurrencies. Luckily the board of JP Morgan Chase & Company is considering replacing him with a friendly bitcoin CEO. Stay tuned and I will let you know when I have more information.\n\nEdit 2: Downvote all you want, bcashers, it doesn't change anything.",
