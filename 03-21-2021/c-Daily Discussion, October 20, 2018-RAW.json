            "Text": "I hope people understand, in order to make wise decisions, that the january crash IS the .com bubble for crypto. Every new technology goes through this bubble of overinflated prices compared to intrinsic value. It happend with online businesses, the railroad bubble, the radiobubble etc. People who don't understand this pattern think that btc could suddenly have a bullrun towards 100.000 within a year. This is simply impossible, cause every new technology goes through the same pattern. After a new technology is adopted, it takes many many years before the intrinsic value reaches the ath value of the bubble again. For example, it took Microsoft 16 years to reach ath of 2000. If btc is adopted, it's still a good investment, but price will slowly increase during adoptionstage instead of having a crazy bullrun again. This is how the pattern works and there's no technology in the world that can escape this pattern.  BTC reaching 12000 in 2021 would be an extremely good performance and probably the best investment if you compare it to investing in Gold or stocks. But how much bubble compared to intrinsic value was there in cryptospace? Alot of empty air. Companies raising 20 billion is just insane. Alot of empty air must go. Remember: from now on, it's not about specualtion anymore. It's about intrinsic value and adoption. Obviously, when you have so much overinflated prices, it's going to take a very very long time before the intrinsic value reaches the ath bubble value. Most cryptos will never even be able to reach this value, even if they're succesfull. ",

Compare this to it\u2019s all time high nearly $15 bill 24-hr volume back in December. $3.5 USD worth of BTC volume is not high volume. You\u2019re just factually wrong. Why are you stirring the pot? Why are you making up crap? There is no big war. It\u2019s just an utterly quiet dead weekend. The last peak in volume occurred on the Monday with the threat of tether implosion. Since then, it\u2019s been extremely quiet. If you\u2019re bored, go watch a movie. Stop making up crap on a very quiet day.",

Both side try to trick the market that a breakout is happening. Theoretically it should wander out over time. However, please remember, it's Bitcoin. Nobody knows what is going on.",
