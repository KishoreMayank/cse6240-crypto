They went on to say BTC is still pretty early in the development stage and that the recent boom brought all of these issues to the spot light due to not having enough people/resources ready for the boom. Is this something you guys agree with? Give em a little time to implement lightning and have more miners and issues should be fixed? ",

            "Text": "The energy used is not based on the number of transactions. Miners essentially \"bid\" for bitcoins by making trillions of calculations, the more calculations they make the more chance they have to win a block reward (the reward is now 12.5 bitcoins, it cuts in half every 4 years). Since 12.5 bitcoins are currently worth close to $200,000 miners will use a huge amount of electricity in order to try to win the block reward.\n\nThe amount of power used is based on the value of bitcoin, not on number of transaction.\n\nThe reason bitcoins are valuable is that they are expensive to produce/acquire. It is this way by design.",

The Federal Reserve Bank, a semi-private bank, issues the money, not the US government. The money is no more backed by the GDP than Bitcoin (ie. each is worth exactly as much output as another party is willing to trade for it). The only practical differences in backing are: USD are issued and destroyed by the decisions of politicians and bankers where Bitcoin are issued based on your decisions of a decentralized network of coders and nodes; and USD can be used to settle any debt governed by US law.",

The value and cost of production are in a virtuous cycle, a kind feedback loop.\n\nIn any case I never stated that the unforgeable costliness is *sufficient* for the value, but that it is *necessary*. \n\nThis is from the article I linked, in fact:\n\n>If some workmen come dig a hole in my backyard, and fill it up again taking pictures all the while -- so that the hole is unforgeably costly -- have they produced value? The filled-in hole is useless as far as my own needs go; neither does it have collectible value unless I can somehow use the evidence of costliness to store and trade wealth. This isn't as entirely unthinkable as it sounds. The Yap of the South Pacific once moved vast stones by boat, from the island on which it was quarried, to islands without that kind of rock. They used ownership of the resulting fixed stones to store and trade wealth. Alas, collectibes technology advances just as any other, and Yap stones and holes in my backyard just don't cut it any more. The hole is, therefore, quite worthless, regardless of how long and hard the workmen toiled to complete the job.\n\n",
