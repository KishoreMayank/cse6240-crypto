McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \\(maybe way more\\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \\- a couple quite successful among them \\- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \\(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even \"better\" one \\- though \"better\" is relative\\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?\n\nSo far it seems to me that BTC is \\(at least since I started following it \\- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\\) much more about speculation \\(HODL\\) than actual usage as payment \\- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\\+ in value at any moment.\n\nWhat I'm trying to ask is:\n\nIf the goal is to have one \\(or more \\- look at USD and EUR\\) universally accepted decentralized \\(anonymous?\\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \\(and no other cryptocurrency\\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \\(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \\(or an even better\\) job?",

At the moment, this is achievable. Before doing this research, we analyzed many sources and recipes that will help achieve this goal. But this is not enough. We are going to expand this research on the world level and make it legitimate to use alkaloids in medicine - according to our information this will speed up the process of recovery and open new heights in the field of science and medicine. As soon as we receive the necessary data, they will be investigated and sent to science in order to achieve the goal. Now we need the help of the community that supports it. This method of research will be more effective than the medicine used now. For us it will be a breakthrough in the field of science because now it really is necessary.",

Many people believe that crypto will be the currency type of the future and that BTC will be the standard bearer because it seems to be getting more attention than others in terms of pioneer businesses accepting it as payment, etc. In other words, BTC will be more valuable in the future because people will trust its value more than other cryptocurrencies in the future, the same way that people around the world today trust the USD, EUR, and GBP more than other fiat currencies.",

As the tech is open sourced, there are plenty of alts that are actually almost identical.\n\nAnd while there is a lot of speculation activities on cryptos, I very much doubt they are used in real world applications at the moment.  \n\nYes, there are plenty of noise about BTC being the currency of the future, alternative to gold, etc but most of it are just hyperbole to justify the \"value\" of BTC.  Take away the noise and BTC is just a number generated on the network and any value that people put on that number is pure speculation.",

It doesn't cost you extra, but is a little cumbersome. Here are some instructions: https://medium.com/@tednobs/how-to-create-a-secure-bitcoin-cold-wallet-82f82be4bfa",

Completely around the system, no fiat involved. \n\nJust do it.\n\nI believe, the laws are not up to the task to deal with this kind of situation, yet. So I wouldn't worry. Even if you would get into trouble, it would be a very interesting lawsuit...\n\nI mean: What are you doing? You buy some Bitcoin and instantly exchange them for goods. No problem here. The problems arise, when you wait 2 months, they gain 100% in value and then you exchange them for goods. Then you'd have to pay capital gains tax on the increased value.\n\nEven then, it's a gray area, because you don't sell Bitcoin for fiat, but exchange them for goods.\n\nThis is a prime example of a usecase, that will keep courts and lawmakers busy in the coming years...\n\nThe danger you are personally in depends highly on the size of the transactions. If you want to buy a cellphone for Bitcoin, nobody will care. If you want to buy a multimillion dollar villa. People might suspect money laundering...\n\nEdit: I have to add: I am not a lawyer.",

If you don't want to pay for them, you could print out a paper wallet, as long as you're not worried about losing it or someone finding it. Another option is to put a \"paper\" wallet in a file format on an encrypted USB stick instead of printing it. But since you don't have a huge amount, I agree with the user who said that the most sensible option for you is a desktop wallet like Electrum.",

This means that if they are hacked and they're bankrupted, your investment is guaranteed by the feds up to $250K, iirc. That amount of security comes from working with \"the establishment,\" therefor the anti-establishment, conspiratorial crowd hates it mostly because it comes with it a certain level of accountability that is antithetical to the decentralized anonymize nature of crypto. As in, it makes money laundering and subversion more difficult and government surveillance easier. But that is all beside the fact that Coinbase is by far the safest exchange you can keep your investment and is arguably safer than a hardware wallet if you don't know what you're doing (which is 90+% of people invested in bitcoin). If you are a normal person who hasn't drank the extreme techno-libertarian cool-aid and just wants to try their hand, coinbase/gdax is where you should keep your investment and do your trading.",
