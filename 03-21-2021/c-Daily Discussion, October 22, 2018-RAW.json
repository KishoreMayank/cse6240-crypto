There are so many positive things in the works right now, it is absolutely stunning that the price is still so low.  The news that a major institution such as Fidelity is going all in on crypto next year is a very big deal.  Also Bakkt is one of the most exciting things to happen for bitcoin in years and it's launching very soon!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**NYSE Owner\u2019s Bitcoin Futures Market Will Open in Mid-December**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Known as a physically-settled daily futures contract, the contracts will be backed by actual bitcoins held in ICE\u2019s Digital Asset Warehouse. According to a press release, each futures contract will be validated through ICE Clear U.S., the firm\u2019s clearing venue.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>\u201cA critical element to price discovery is physical delivery. Specifically, with our solution, the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. As such, our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset,\u201d Bakkt had said at the time, responding to criticisms that the contracts could mask \u201chidden leverage.\u201d\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>For every one purchase of a USD/BTC futures contract, there will be a delivery of one bitcoin into the owner\u2019s account at settlement. That contrasts with the bitcoin futures markets on CBOE and CME, which are cash-settled, meaning that no actual cryptocurrency assets exchange hands at expiration.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.ccn.com/nyse-owners-bitcoin-futures-market-will-open-in-mid-december/\n \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n[- Hopium Time Archives -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/) ",

As she get's older, more people are going to notice she's attractive and start showing more interest in her, but for now, she's not on their radar. For those watching her grow up, we already know she's going to be a heart breaker, and thankfully there are tons of bright minds making sure she'll have the brains to match.",

ATMs are also a way to \"bank\" for a largely cash-transacted economy.  They are willing to pay the high fees for this service (7-10+%) while the banked user pays 1% to buy on an exchange or just gets a checking account.  In those poorer neighborhoods that might be considered exploitative.  I'm guessing if I ever use one it will be for a quick conversion to local currency while traveling which I would also expect to pay a fee for.",

            "Text": "Well, the framework is being laid out, and that takes time. For big artificial spikes based only on hype like last year's short-lived bubble, that's interest following price, better known as FOMO! Soon as people realized investors were making gains, media outlets jumped on this olive branch to generate get rich quick articles because they generate a lot of traffic, which brings in ad revenue. The whole thing spiraled out of control with a snowball effect of price rising and more people chasing the rising price and FOMOing in.\n\nFast-forward to now: We have far more developments, framework, partnerships in the works, more ways to get involved, etc. What started out as a currency has been recognized as an entire industry of mining, storage companies, store of value potential, speculative investment, and much more. Once it all kicks in together, it will probably be like a lot of tech in the past, where a surge will happen and the price of Bitcoin would have to follow, since more people will be looking for a piece of the same pie... a pie that can't get any larger because of the cap on supply. Eventually it could easily be used for its original intended purpose also, as a currency, but not one that replaces FIAT at first. Instead I believe it will run as an alternative currency and see wide adoption for online transactions and cross border transfers.   \n\n\nEither way, the volume will come and few will see it coming. The foundation is getting created, and once this thing kicks in you'll have all the volume you ever wanted and much more.\n\n&#x200B;",

Last year when everyone was going nuts over bitcoin, it needed to show people how it solved a problem they had, was easier to use than a credit/debit card, or showed some other advantage that made people stick around and actually use it. \n\nInstead, we had a huge burst of activity fueled by speculation, and then [everyone disappeared after the bubble burst](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin&geo=US). \n\nI know a do a bunch of trolling here, but if I can be serious for a minute, this place really does remind me of /r/dogecoin after the joke died. Mainstream people aren't coming back anytime soon. Eventually opportunists like IBM will move onto the \"next big thing\" and media attention is going to die out, too. Markets can be irrational for a very long time, especially opaque markets like crypto, but eventually as more and more people start to realize that the light is fading, they're going to be less and less active in this space... leaving only the die-hard hodlers who think that the next December 2017 is just around the corner, if only a few more sandwich shops in Prague started accepting bitcoin.\n\nI guess what I'm really trying to say is, buy bitcoin so that you're not left holding the parasitic wealth of nations. \n\n&#x200B;",

I agree last year was a debacle especially when USA\u2019s biggest exchange decided to randomly add btrash without telling anyone. It sent mistrust throughout the market that will take years to recover from. Plus you have an asshole forking bitcoin into btrash and making a fool of himself and committing fraud which is still under investigation with his bait and switch on a bitcoin website. \nIf you notice, the market reacted as it should have. Now once Ver is brought to justice and trust is established again, the market can continue on its path. People like him are just pure shit stealing and taking advantage of new investors. He will have to pay for his crimes if people trust the market again. \n\nIt always makes us feel disappointed if bitcoin never forked last year: It would be so much stronger but not everyone can play nice. Segwit and Lightning were going to happen no matter what. It\u2019s evolution. He wanted to disrupt it and boy did he. More than anyone could have predicted. Once Btrash is revealed to be a shit coin with no innovation and Ver faces justice for his crimes, bitcoin can continue its evolution and innovation. ",

            "Text": "\\- Well first off, without alternatives we'd be in bad shape. Bitcoin can be a very successful alternative currency for digital transactions. It can move millions of dollars of value for 10 cents. And it's global, decentralized and not tied to any one country or region!\n\n\\- It's can serve as a global record keeper for transactions that is backed by perfect math and exceptional redundancy.\n\n\\- It's a push system, not a pull system, so nobody can steal your money without access to your private keys.\n\n\\- There's nothing wrong with an investment opportunity, or even a gamble - Gambling is a very very big industry. Vegas is an enormous machine that generates revenue, creates jobs, etc.\n\n\\- As a high-risk portion of a portfolio it can easily become a standard part of an overall investment plan or even retirement plan as the space matures.\n\n\\- It may be on its early legs, but Bitcoin has the potential to be the most secure, accurate and efficient store of value the world has even seen hands down.\n\n\\- Then there's the network value; ask any large company how much they'd value a network with impeccable accuracy that has never been hacked, experienced 99.9% up time over 10 years, and eliminates the cost of maintenance, because it requires no accountants or employees... it maintains itself and everyone involved gets their fair share on a freelance structure (miners for example).\n\nThat's just off the top of mind. Imagine the possibilities when the space actually gets built and matures. Because if there's one thing nobody can argue, it's that even though the price moves in big spikes and drops, there's been no slack on the growth of infrastructure.  Just wait until it becomes easy for non-technical people to acquire and store with confidence.",

            "Text": "I agree there's certainly firms out there looking for high risk investments. The argument I've seen flying around is that bitcoin belongs in your 401k and backing pension funds, though, which are both usually very conservative investments. \n\nTo me, it seems like the \"institutional\" money is more likely to fund exchanges and other startups rather than just buying BTC at market value. Better to sell shovels than dig gold, ya know?\n\nIn my opinion, all of this institutional money seems more like the last layer of bagholders so that the big guys can cash out without crashing the market. Bitmain is doing the IPO route, others are looking for their ways, too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
