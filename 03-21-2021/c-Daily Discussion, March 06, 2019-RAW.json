            "Text": "Just so I understand, Starbucks has to pay it's rent and bills in fiat, so it is going to use an intermediary to take payments as an exchange. Exchanges rely on fees, so basically, a $5 latte is (for argument's sake) 5btc PLUS some kind of fee which protects starbucks from an instantaneous crash. Like, I buy a 5 btc latte and a second later, it either booms or busts. Starbucks needs some kind of insurance, or instantaneous exchange. Insurance would be a fee of 3%, or instantaneous exchange to fiat would also be a fee added. \n\nThe hurdle isn't that people won't accept bitcoin, it's that it's not native to how they pay their rent. If their rent is 10,000 a month in fiat, and the cost of bitcoin fluctuates, it could really burn their bottom line if they don't immediately exchange it, so a $5 latte will cost the consumer 5 btc + the fee. (assuming it's 1-1)",

This all about progress in extremely early days. These types of partnerships and developments help moving forward with applications for customers to convert their digital assets into US dollars, which can then be used in stores. The exchange you're talking about in your post...would be Bakkt.",
