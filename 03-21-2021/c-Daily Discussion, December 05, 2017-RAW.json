Would Bitcoin be just as secure and trustless if nobody but miners ran Core?\n\nI understand the advantages of running a full node to an individual or a merchant - being able to personally verify transactions without trusting in any third party - but I have recently seen some comments from people who argue that the *only* nodes that really matter are miners. They argue that \"hash power always wins in any dispute\", so miners are the only nodes who can contribute to a consensus, therefore non-mining nodes have no power and thus aren't important.\n\nThis doesn't sit right with me, because surely a currency only gets its value from those who use it; miners get no real world benefits from mining a fork that nobody else on the network recognises as legitimate or valuable. But I'm still not 100% convinced either way, and I'm struggling to visualise how a situation where an attack by \"dishonest miners\" might play out in the real world, and whether the existence of a large number of full nodes *really* does anything to protect the integrity of the network as a whole.\n\nAny insights or links to further info would be welcome. Thanks in advance :)",

So that means 0.00000001 bitcoins will be worth $0.01, or if you do the math, 1 bitcoin will be worth $1 million\n\nanother idea is US dollar market cap (68 trillion?) to the eventual 21 million bitcoins.\n\nthoughts?",

However if I go to gdax now it still takes me to the verification process and I cannot choose ID document as a verification instrument at all. I thought that once I get verified on coinbase.com I get auto verified on Gdax also.

Do i create a blockchain.info wallet and then sweep the private key from the paper wallet into that wallet.  Transfer portions of the bitcoins to new addresses I create in that wallet.

Jumping on the wagon too late\u201d and shrugged off the idea of investing some dollaroo\u2019s.\n\nHowever in the last week alone I\u2019ve seen the price spike by $1,000 AUD at least. I\u2019m new to investing and no one in my family follows it, however I have a spare $500 laying around that wouldn\u2019t hurt me I\u2019m the foreseeable future if I lost it. Is it worth me throwing that $500AUD into bitcoin and sitting on it?",

            "Text": "This is one of the few problems I have with Bitcoin, too many coins became available too early, or the 21 million limit is too low.  There\u2019s too few people that own too many bitcoins.  If there were only 5 million bitcoins in existence at this stage things would project to be much more balanced.   \n\nBecause of this issue, as well as the scaling problem, I feel that the Bitcoin price represents confidence and demand for cryptocurrencies, not specifically for Bitcoin.  Not this is necessarily a bad thing for the world, just could be a bad thing for Hodlers in 3-5 years time.",

Take some fun in timing the buys (if you're long term hold), but don't attempt to time or feel bad for missing, the dips.",

            "Text": "Yeah that's the worry of many people, the more specialized and exclusive mining becomes, the more centralized the entire 'control' of the blockchain becomes as well.\n\nBut still, for miners to effectively abuse the chain to gain any money they would need a 50%+ share of the mining power and time it right with whatever tactic they use to cheat everyone, doublespend or whatever. Which would be extremely unlikely, difficult and risky.\n\nEven less likely would be to alter already existing transactions in nodes.  Almost everyone would have to be on board. Bitcoin would have to fork and likely the whole system would crumble if the nodes across the network were all compromised... \n\nMaybe there should be (or is) a contingency plan for everyone to roll back a certain amount of blocks if an attack occurs. But the damage towards trusting the system would be done.",

            "Text": "Miners simply offer blocks. Your node (or the node you are using to access the network) either accepts the block or doesn't. Plain and simple. Miners don't want to waste resources on blocks that aren't accepted. \n\nSo running a node, or knowing the source of where your SPV wallet is connecting is important in that it dictates what consensus rules you are running and thus what chain you are following. \n\nThe \"hash power is king\" argument is stupid, and is brought from the idea of BIP9 that was simply intended to ensure that the majority of the hash power was coordinated to prevent an accidental fork. It turned into a political play with the miners holding the chain hostage for fees. At the threat of a UASF (regular nodes denying blocks that don't meet our consensus), the NYA was proposed and miners activated Segwit using the NYA as a scapegoat. The event did let us know that miners can't be trusted to implement changes, so BIP9 will never be used again. So with that said, hash power really means all of nothing. \n\nWorse comes to worse, we could HF with a completely different POW, render the current miners useless, and everyone carries on like normal. Hash power simply discourages misbehaving but if they are already misbehaving, it is failed and no longer serves its purpose. In reality \"network effect is king\", and the hash power will follow the most profitable coin, which is the one with the network effect giving it value. \n\nIn the end, the only thing giving bitcoin value is the fact that it *is bitcoin*, ***the bitcoin*** that everyone has heard about for years. That's why the Bcash clan is so set on stealing the name, because it is the name (and the history that goes along with it), that is what gives this particular ledger value. ",

            "Text": "The way I understand it, there are 3 parts to a bitcoin address.\n\nPrivate key -> (Eliptic Curve Cryptography) -> Public Key -> (SHA256 + RIPEMD) -> Bitcoin Address\n\nThe Eliptic Curve Cryptography is considered weak to quantum computing (using Shor's algorithm). However the SHA256 and RIPEMD step is considered resitant to quantum computing.\n\nThe public key only needs to be published when you actually spend coins. It can be kept a secret up until that point, other people only need to know your Bitcoin Address to send you coins.\n\nAs long as you don't re-use the same address after you have spent coins from it then no one else will know your public key and you will be resistant to quantum attacks. Wallets will normally empty all coins out of an address when you spend from it. Then transfer any left over change to a brand new address. So they are resistant to quantum attacks by default. \n",

            "Text": "I'm fairly new to this too, so my information could be totally misinformed/wrong. But I ended up using the way to buy/sell with no fees using Coinbase and GDAX. And from what I gathered, GDAX is usually the best place overall, only using Coinbase as a supplementary connection to GDAX (since they're both connected).\n\nBasically, transfer money to your Coinbase account using a bank transfer (takes 5 days or so I think, but I believe it's free if you do it this way). Then using GDAX deposit the funds into your GDAX account once they're transferred. Then using GDAX purchase/sell only using the LIMIT option with \"post only\" checked.\n\nIf you don't understand how the buying/selling works exactly look up some Youtube tutorials for Limit purchases/sells within GDAX. It's fairly easy once you get the hang of it.",

            "Text": "I can explain whatever you want, I think I finally understand everything about the order book now. If you have any questions let me know.\n\nI wrote this up a while back so tell me if it's useful. I can clean it up and format it a bit too; I'm thinking of posting this soon enough because I wish someone had verbally explained to me everything when I started.\n\n**Limit Orders**\n\n - A limit buy means someone has told the exchange to buy bitcoin for them when the price drops to $X.\n - A limit sell means someone told an exchange to automatically sell their bitcoin when the price reaches $Y.\n - **Limit orders *do not guarantee* that your entire order will be filled.** Even if you set a limit order for 1 cent above or below the current price, it's possible it never gets filled (if the price never hits that number again)\n - Limit orders generally have less/no fees\n - People who make limit orders are called \"makers\".\n - Limit orders are displayed on the order book. \n- On GDAX, the order book is displayed on the left hand side, you can view it in increments varying from $0.01 to $10.00 (the +/- at the bottom)\n- The greens are limit buys and the reds are limit sells. \n- This is visually displayed with the depth chart in the middle of the UI (in between your orders/fills and the price graph). This is where you see buy/sell walls (tall vertical lines indicating a large amount of bitcoin to be sold/bought).\n\n**Market Orders**\n\n - A market buy means someone has told the exchange to buy $X amount of bitcoin, even if the price moves while fulfilling that order (this is called slippage).\n - A market sell means someone has told the exchange to sell $Y amount of bitcoin, even if the price moves. \n - **Market orders are *guaranteed* to fill your entire order.** If you want $1000 of bitcoin, you're getting $1000 of bitcoin. \n - The people who make market orders are called \"takers\". \n - Takers on GDAX are charged 0.25% fees on every transaction (this % goes all the way down to 0.1% if you trade a significant volume over time).\n - **The price moves when someone burns through all of the current limit buys/sells, depending on which way the price is going.**\n\n**Stop Orders**\n\n- These are essentially market orders that are triggered after a certain price is met.\n- These are generally used by traders to ensure that they don't miss out on big swings in price.\n- A buy *stop* set at, say $1000, for 1 BTC, would mean that someone puts in a market buy for 1 BTC as soon as the price hits 1 cent above $1000.\n- A stop *sell* is the same thing, but the opposite direction: when the price dips below a certain point, the exchange would sell the specified amount of bitcoin.\n- Stop orders are guaranteed to fill the entire order unless they are stop limit orders. This essentially is a market order with a limit on the price. If enough slippage occurs during the market order, the limit kicks in and the whole order isn't filled. This could've been very useful for some people who made market buys at, say, $9000 when the price dipped this past week. If they wanted to only buy at $9000 and not at $8900 (because maybe they believe bitcoin will crash if it dips below $8900) then they'd set a stop limit buy at $9000 with the limit at $8900.\n- **Stop orders are not displayed on the order book.**\n- Stop orders can cause a big price spike/dip because they'll chew through the order book very quickly right after large, round numbers. \n\n**An example of how a market buy would push the price up by burning through limit sells:**\n\n - Say the current price is $100. \n - There is 1 bitcoin at a limit sell for $100. \n - The next offer is 1 at $200. \n - The next offer is 1 at $400. \n - If you place a market buy for $600, you get:\n   1. the first bitcoin at $100\n   2. the second at $200\n   3. and 0.75 bitcoins at $400 (you pay $300 for it, $300/$400 is 0.75 bitcoins)\n - you now own 2.75 bitcoins and the current bitcoin price is now $400 with 0.25 bitcoins being offered at $400.\n\nThe sell walls (or buy walls, just swap sell with buy and up with down here) just means there's a huge amount of BTC to be sold at a certain price. Usually at round numbers, it can get up to hundreds of bitcoins. Since the price doesn't move until all these orders are filled, sell walls essentially stop the price from moving up until every single one has been completely sold. \n\nLet me know if that helps. I may have abused the bold/italics in there but hopefully it's pretty readable.\n\nAlso if anyone finds any errors please let me know.",

            "Text": " Auto buy and sell is basically what limit orders do. You set a price to sell for and when someone is willing to pay the price you set it gets sold. Opposite for limit buy orders, you can set a price below market price, go to sleep and if the market price dips down to your limit it's automatically bought at that price.\nCreating a limit buy order below market price involves zero fees, if your order is above and gets immediately filled you pay fees. It's the opposite for limit sell orders.\nI'm sure some people are using bots too, but I have no knowledge regarding the use of it.",

The price quickly rebounded, but some ETH where sold for pennies, even though the limit trigger was in the hundreds.\n\nIf on GDAX right now someone sold 16,000 BTC, the price would drop to only 5k, and there are people with more than that amount of BTC.",

            "Text": "I think maybe it is worth re looking at how much money is actually needed to move bitcoins price. There is actually only a small proportion of bitcoin that is being sold and bought as a proportion of total bitxoin. This is due to many lost wallets, holders etc. \n\nHowever the total market cap is calculated by saying that all currently 16m+ coins have the same value. This is technically true but the price is being moved by the trading of the few bitcoins that are actually being traded. Saying that tether is only a small percentage of overall bitcoin market cap is therefore misleading when it is being used to influence the price of the few bitcoins that are actually being traded.\n\nYou could argue that the overall market cap of bitcoin is inflated by coins that will never be used (which doesn't necessarily mean the price of the individual coins is less)",

Yeah, I hadn't thought about it that way, in that BTC is more speculative and stocks are based on tangible numbers.\n\nI guess since I'm not exactly \"rolling in it\", it might make the most sense to buy as much as I can during the dips, and in the meantime, just buy a little bit each month. Sacrifice a $5 coffee or two haha.\n\nAnother question; how has BTC managed to increase so much in value? How did it even begin to get popular enough to increase so much in value? I can't think of many things I would use BTC for, with the exception of buying and selling. The only person I know that has actually used BTC for buying something, was when my friend bought some BTC to buy a fake ID with. How has BTC managed to be so successful, despite most people cocking their heads to the side when I mention it?",

Or if you use coinbase, you might pay 9200 for that 9000 bitcoin, but you get it that day'sp price.  So from financial principles buying from CB would be silly due to the fees, but if you are expecting it to rise more than the fees in the 4-5 days waiting, it's not terrible to just buy from CB.  In all when that $9200 btc showed up (original non fee value $9k), it was worth $9500.",

            "Text": "No, hes saying too many coins became available too soon.  In the early days it was so easy to snap up hundreds or thousands of coins.  So many coins were introduced so quickly that they had hardly any worth.  Then interest in crypto spiked and quickly turned people that had thousands of nearly worthless coins into millionaires.  When they suddenly dropped those vast amounts of coins on the market it caused turmoil.  \n\nIf bitcoins were doled out more slowly then there would be fewer people from the early days holding large amounts of them, causing less volatility in the price as they wouldn't be able to suddenly dump large amounts of coins on the market.  Things might've been more stable and the price might've risen at a steady and stable pace instead of the vast ups and downs we've seen in bitcoins history.  This is all speculation of course, and there are many other factors that have caused the volatility in bitcoins price, but this is at least part of it.\n\nPut another way, in the early days, there was tons of supply and hardly any demand.  Supply then increased at a slower and slower rate (mining rewards being halved), whereas demand has shot up exponentially.  At some point demand crossed a tipping point where supply increases just couldn't keep up anymore, and the initial supply from the early days also wasn't enough.  This is why the price has increased so much recently and why many believe it will continue on its exponential trajectory.  Price is all about supply vs demand, and supply is only going to slow down more and more.  Where demand goes, who knows?",

            "Text": "Futures are contracts with an underlying asset. You agree to buy or sell a certain amount of something (stocks, commodities, whatever) on a date in the future at a price you agree to now. You are betting the movement in price between now and the contract date is favourable to you. If you are selling, you are betting the price will fall, so by setting a price now you will get more than whatever it will be worth on the day. If you are buying it is the opposite. You are betting the price will go up so you are locking in today's price. Often futures can involve leverage. So essentially contracts on the asset to buy or sell at a later date.\n\nWhat does it mean for bitcoin? It means institutional investors that are attracted to these products for hedging ability (using financial instruments to offset risk of negative price movements) now have a simple means of betting on a price decline, and also hedging their exposure in the sector.  Previously the ability the hedge against rises and profit on falls was not widely available in a format pleasing to institutional investors.\n\nWill it make a big difference to price movements when it starts trading? I don't have any idea, and I don't think anyone else does either. Typically futures don't drive or effect prices of the raw asset that underlies them, but the fact that it offers institutions an easier means of shorting (betting on a fall) is perhaps a net negative.\n\n\n",
