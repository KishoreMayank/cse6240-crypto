All are pro crypto. \nAs you know trump was challenged by JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon recently that he could beat trump in an election. Dimon is very anti-crypto. What revenge could he enact on this perceived insult: more pro-crypto appointments. Mick Mulvaney who controls the entire USA budget is pro crypto since before his selection 2 years ago. SEC is being pushed pro crypto. \n\nJust an FYI. ",

If you use your phone to download shit and go to fishy websites, you can get fucked just as much, but the area of attack is smaller. Offline wallets is the safest way to go obviously, but for smaller amounts a phone wallet is nothing to be afraid of. Just make sure you have the seed or private keys backed up *offline* in case your phone gets stolen or breaks down or something. There's many around, especially for android, do some research, find something you like. I wrote an article on it a while ago, it surely is outdated but it may still be useful in some ways: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7k3ydl/an_indepth_overview_of_different_mobile_wallets/\ncome to think of it I should probably do a follow-up on that post",
