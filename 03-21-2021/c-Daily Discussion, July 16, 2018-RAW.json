Thank you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83c\udf08 Hopium Time \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d - S02E03\n\n&nbsp;\n**The Bet.**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, I have decided to make a bet.  Some of you may recall a few months ago I made a prediction that Bitcoin would be $100,000 USD within 3 years.  I'm not sure exactly the first time I said it, but I think it was somewhere between May-June.  So let's just say by May 1st.  Here's one such instance:\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qhgbl/daily\\_discussion\\_june\\_12\\_2018/e0jkcth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8qhgbl/daily_discussion_june_12_2018/e0jkcth)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy bet is that by May 1, 2021 the price of Bitcoin will be at least $100,000 USD.  If it does not reach my target, then I will **donate ONE bitcoin** to my favorite charity, The Independence Fund.  [https://www.independencefund.org](https://www.independencefund.org)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>The Independence Fund\u2019s mission is to empower our severely wounded Veterans and their Caregivers to take control of their lives. We provide the resources and tools that enable Veterans to regain their independence, and fight for their ability to sustain it.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe high tech wheelchairs that they provide the Vets are amazing and really life changing.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEven if Bitcoin reaches my $100,000 USD target, I will still make a donation amount of my own choice, but it will at least be enough to buy ONE wheelchair (\\~$15,000 USD each, I believe).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nJust to be clear on my bet above. The price must reach $100,000 USD sometime between now and May 1, 2021 for me to win the bet. If it reaches only $99,999 I will lose the bet. If it reaches $100,000 before May 1, 2021 and dips below $100,000 on May 1, 2021, then I still win the bet.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWould anyone like to pledge to match my donation (see below)?  If so please reply to this thread.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI hope my confidence in Bitcoin's long term price potential gives you some hope, especially in this frustrating bear market.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**7/21/18 Revision to bet matching:**\n\nI will allow someone who pledges to match my bet to decide what percentage of my donation they will match (minimum 5%).  Please reply directly to this thread to make your honor bound irrevocable commitment to donate with me on May 1, 2021.  **You would make your donation directly to the charity on that date.**  I will include you on my public list of donors.  Also, while I have pledged to donate enough to buy one track chair for the Vets even if I win the bet, you as a bet matcher, will be encouraged to do the same, but it is not required.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you have any questions, or need clarification please fee free to ask.  Thanks for your time in reading this.  I hope you will participate for this great charity, The Independence Fund!\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\nMay 1st is [Silver Star Service Banner Day](https://militarybenefits.info/silver-star-service-banner-day/), a time to recognize those who have been awarded The Silver Star Medal, and remember the sacrifices of our wounded and ill veterans.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is also [Loyalty day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_Day) - a day set aside \"for the reaffirmation of loyalty to the United States and for the recognition of the heritage of American freedom.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo it seems like a fitting day to make the donation.  \n\n\n",

            "Text": "The BlackRock story is such bullshit on a number of levels. (1) First of all, I never even heard of BlackRock until this Bitcoin story now. It\u2019s not to discredit them, they are a massively profitable hedge fund but only the 10th biggest. (2) I don\u2019t even believe the whales are using BlackRock as a narrative to pump the crypto market the same way they used the hard fork Bitcoin ABC. I think it\u2019s an opportune timing to pump the crypto market but I believe this minor pump is pure manipulation. (3) Most importantly, the BlackRock story tells us nothing. London Financial Times reported that \u201cBlackRock is getting serious about the cryptocurrency market\u201d...as opposed to what... they weren\u2019t getting serious in the past? This is not news. Every investment company has been seriously evaluating cryptocurrency. To deny this is buffoonery. This story tells us nothing. So, what if BlackRock is getting serious? That doesn\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019ve been serious about doing cocaine for the past 20 years, never did it. This story really holds no information. Black rock is getting a working group.. is this the same working group that as existed for them since 2012 yet they still ignored the 2017 run Bitcoin had? Truth of the matter is...if BlackRock didn\u2019t want to touch Bitcoin in 2017, there is no chance they will invest during a year long slump today. This is just a story to create false optimism during a very slow stagnant time. Nothing more.",

That one event or release of information that hits public sentiment with a hammer and reverses everything to bullish. Because this is a very potential reality in this market, even if it results in another bubble that gets deflated once again in 6 months. \nYou can't possibly believe that you'll get a heads up or some tip that it's coming.. because that's how it works.",

So if it is worth $99,999 on that day then the charity gets one bitcoin at that price from me. \n\nIf I win the bet (bitcoin surpasses 100k sometime between now and May 1, 2021 then I get to decide how much I will donate.  It will be at least enough to buy one track chair (~15k). \n\nI\u2019m not going to commit to give one whole bitcoin even if I win.  The price of one bitcoin could be a lot higher that 100k by then and I may not want to give that much. But again, I will donate at least one track chair in that instance. Perhaps more depending on my prerogative. \n\nThe charity wins either way though. It wins bigger the higher the price goes, as long as it doesn\u2019t surpass 100k by my date. \n\n\nHowever, don\u2019t be surprised if bitcoin moons beyond 100k  and I\u2019m feeling extra generous at that point. \n\n",

            "Text": "The 2017 run was a sure thing. It started out at $1,000 and rose to $20K. Yet, all the major institutional investors avoid BTC like a Black Plague. Sure, it\u2019s a cheaper entry point today but that isn\u2019t exactly a rationale for institutional investors to buy BTC. To gain their assurance, they need to see major banks get behind BTC and that\u2019s far from coming into fruition. A cheaper point was a year ago this date when BTC was $2,000 (a fraction of what it is today). Yet, all the institutional investors avoided it. You sound way too wishful and optimistic to discuss the overlying factors of what would propel the Blackrocks to get behind BTC. At this moment, there is nothing to gain their confidence. We would strong government backing or the BOAs, Wells Fargo\u2019s to fall in line.",

            "Text": ">BTC is about taking control of your own wealth (only you can touch it),\n\nOn a technical level yes, but on a legal level no. The Government in almost every country has sovereign right to all wealth. For example if the Government audits you and you lie about how much Bitcoin you have, it's as a good as gone, because the moment you're caught spending Bitcoin that you declared you did not have, you'll be jailed or fined for fraud against the state.\n\nSo you can't evade taxes with Bitcoin, for you to cash out you must declare it.\n\nIf your government ever initiates a wealth tax on Bitcoin you'll either have to declare and pay x% per year or not declare and lose the ability to ever spend it again.\n\nAlso due to the larger number of youth who are interested in social policies, most governments will enact 1%-5% wealth tax over the next few decades.",

But BTC is not that yet. It's a hugely speculative investment where you're either going to lose everything or be fabulously wealthy, or both in any given week.\n\nThis \"debt driven fiat inflation is stealing\" stuff is nonsense - the only people being robbed by inflation are people who have a shit tonne of cash who don't intend to work for the rest of their life. Everyone else gets a weekly inflation adjusted pay check from their employer.\n\nYes, you could buy a lot of things with a nickel 20 years ago. But a washing machine and a car was an aspirational purchase that might takes years to afford - now you can buy one with a weeks pay.",

Let's say he has Bitcoin - but you want dollars.\n\nSean opens up his Lightning app and sends $5 to an address provided by your bank (more on this in a minute). Stellar and Bitcoin's Lightning Networks will be connected by roughly December, so let's assume that's happened. The Bitcoin is exchanged via a smart contract onto Stellar's network, quickly routed to your bank, which is a Stellar anchor, and shows up in your account. You don't need to log in to any exchange.\n\nThis technology already exists. LN is here on Bitcoin, it's in beta on Stellar, and Stellar has atomically swapped currencies for years, and has fiat anchors acting as banks in multiple countries. Is YOUR bank acting as a Stellar anchor yet? Doubtful, but we're still early. The point is that the infrastructure exists already for this.",

Same incentive as a normal savings account that would have free transfers and ATMs as a service. I imagine the first bank to offer free international transfers will scoop up a lot of customers.\n\nThe stellar network fee is like $0.00002. Add that to the LN fee and any slippage and you're still well under a cent in net cost for an international transfer. They'll need some servers on the backend, but that's not a lot of cost for the bank just to offer this for free, with a lot of upside.",

Picture the market for no foreign transaction fee credit cards - it\u2019s huge. Now imagine those banks can do that at a fraction of the cost. ",
