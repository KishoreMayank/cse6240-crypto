            "Text": "Shorting is usually done on the margin. You just sell when it starts to dip and have clear conscience of a bear market and then buy back when you're comfortable with the profits. \n\nAlternatively you can just gamble and short everytime you see a slight downturn and buy back in like 10$ increments and do the same for rises. \n\nDo that multiple times a day and with 10 plus btc and you're making more than most Americans make in their regular day jobs.",

This can occur if the price has risen to a point where short sellers must make margin calls, or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

You still have to convince 300,000 business owners across the United States to take something other than cash or debit cards. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying to you. I agree that it is fundamentally better, but so is communism. The question is how fast can we adopt it? Look at Tesla cars. Clearly Tesla cars are  much better, better for the environment, safer, don\u2019t use gas or oil. And yet the technology has been around for quite some time, and yet auto makers are still slow to adapt. I\u2019m not saying that the bitcoin Won\u2019t ever be popular, I am just saying it\u2019s not going to happen in the next 5 to 7 years that there is a 99% adoption rate across the country.
