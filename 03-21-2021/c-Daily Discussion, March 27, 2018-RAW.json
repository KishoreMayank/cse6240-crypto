It's strictly buying because it's the hot thing. It has no real intrinsic value or cost.\n\n\u2022\u00a0If the stock market goes down, people will sell BTC, and thus BTC will ALSO go down and crash, so really, it's no different. The idea it will survive the crash is complete nonsense. \n\n\u2022 If all currencies around the globe are based on the Dollar and Libor and Interest, having another currency also based on the dollar does no real benefit. \n\nMaybe I am confused, so could someone tell me the point of Bitcoin?",

There has been a serious amount of damage done to the market. If you look at the all-time chart, the rise and crash we are experiencing looks a lot like what happened at the end of 2013. The only difference is that the peak was way higher this time.\n\nI have no doubt that BTC will be worth a fortune in the long-run, but that does not mean we will not endure another major bear market before then. \n\nHopefully there\u2019s another bounce that fires us back up and maintains it\u2019s momentum. I\u2019d love to see that. However, BTC is not your friend. It does not owe you anything. There is absolutely no reason that the market could not callapse temporarily as it has before. \n\nI\u2019m just waiting for the people who HODL all the way down and then claim \u201cGuys it\u2019s still up since 2011?\u201d",

This acquisition provides HIVE with significant flexibility for long-term growth. Our vision is to scale the project in phases to be among the largest and most energy-efficient data centres in the world. We continue to explore non-dilutive financing alternatives to commence the build-out as soon as possible.\u201d",

But in just 3 months time I can easily imagine a lot of adoption with suppliers of goods and services worldwide, due to innovations like lightning, schnorr sig, seg-wit and so on. \n\nSo I wonder what is the fair price at that point in time?\n\nAs such expectations seem to not be priced in. It is also interesting that we are in line with the average historic growth of bitcoin.",

Once upon a time somebody told me that a single Bitcoin would potentially be worth $10,000. I literally laughed at the thought. It was just as absurd 6 years ago as the sound of $1 million now. I hoped it would, but no part of me in any sense thought that was anywhere near possible. I thought winning the lottery would happen sooner than 1BTC = $10k.\n\n...and here we are in 2018 complaining and moaning about how Bitcoin has \"TANKED\" down to 8k from $20k. \nSo now when I hear figures like $500,000, $1 million... I'm not as dismissive. If Bitcoin has taught me one thing it's that what seems like ridiculous speculation today may be the price you wish you bought at in a few years.",

They are the ones profiting, and will continue to profit while everyone else sits, holds, and prays.\n\nIn the end, Bitcoin will end up no different than any other financial \"toy\" for the people with power and money.\n\nAs many have said, though, the blockchain tech is the real prize here.",

Your address is a hash of a public key. Your public key is derived from your private key.\n\nSo the same private key will always make the same address. When I send bitcoin to an address, I am really saying **the first person to prove they own this address can take this money.**\n\nIt just so happens that it is really hard to fake. Like, super hard. Impossible, for all intents and purposes. It will never happen. So don't lose your private key!\n\n",

But you are asking Banks, and global leaders in control, to release their control of money? HA HA it's not going to happen. Don't forget, America prints it's own money, and so the value of things changes. If we were on a global currency, printing money when people want bitcoin, becomes valueless in of itself, and governments can't have that. So, just as with communism, it's great to dream, and hypothesize that banks will turn over the money and power, but in reality it will not happen in my lifetime. ",

            "Text": "They never said the internet wouldn't happen. I never heard that, and I am in my 40's. What I DID hear, was that the moment it gets good, Commercial interests, Porn, and Governments would take it over. That's what we have seen. The same will happen with Bitcoin. \n\nNow, Banks make money by LOANING our money out to others and charging interest, or packaging those loans and selling them to others. When you have a digital currency, how does that work? Is digital currency sitting somewhere where it can be loaned out? \n\nPlus, when you open a bank, with small amounts of money, they give you extra. You can withdraw more than you put in the bank, and the bank gives you a tiny bit of credit, but then fines the shit out of you. \n\nRemoving the banking issue radically changes why we go to banks. Loans would then be owned by rich people, and be in effect, loan sharks. Banks would not exist to loan out money, because there are no groups of people with money to loan out. Or, is there? Is Coinbase really buying bitcoin, and having accounts, or are they merely holding it all in one centralized location, like a bank? Could Coinbase loan out the digital currency for interest? And if that is the case, is there ANY difference if I am getting fined by Coinbase, or fined by Chase Bank? Imagine if I had a debit card that was a Bitcoin Debit card. Is Coinbase a new type of bank, with the same rules?",

You're nothing I haven't seen before. You're not saying anything relevant or important. Just more of the same noise in the bearish months of a repetitive cycle. I'm not even mad at you, actually you're probably angry because in your mind you think you missed out on immense profits so in a way I feel bad for you. \n\nJust go find another hobby, FUD as you may you have literally zero impact on the price. The real impactful FUD comes from institutions and governments, not some nobody on Reddit. Spend your energy elsewhere trust me.",
