            "Text": "So I've been reading this page for awhile now, trying to work out whether bitcoin is something I should be invested in, one way or the other. My summation of the general arguments I've picked up so far, and my take on them is outlined below.\n\n(a) The payment arguments. That bitcoin could one day be hugely valuable if it were adopted as a day-to-day currency (i.e. use it at the supermarket). The problem I have with this argument is that Bitcoin doesn't seem to provide any great benefit over fiat currency for this purpose; and that it would face stiff opposition from both established players (visa, mastercard) and emergent players (Apple Pay, Google Pay).\n\n(b) The transfer-of-value arguments. The bitcoin could be an effective way to move value from one place to another. This is one that I find somewhat convincing, as it provides a significant benefit over the existing mechanisms for transferring value; for instance, it can be significantly cheaper than something like Western Union. But then, Western Union itself has $7B market cap, Bitcoin $63B. At a glance - and in my highly technical analysis :) - it looks like bitcoin aspires to do more than just this.\n\n(c) The store-of-value arguments. That bitcoin could one day play a role like that of gold. It seems completely unsuited toward this purpose due to the rampant volatility. Why would I ever trust bitcoin for this purpose, when gold has such a well established record?\n\n(d) The speculation arguments. That bitcoin is a good investment vehicle because it attracts speculators which will drive the value up and down. More than any of the other 3 arguments made, this is a proven and strong case for investment in (and out!) of bitcoin, and clearly can make immense profits when it is correctly played.\n\nAs a wildcard, illegal activities change all these - we've seen how it can work for cases (a) - (c) through Silk Road, when the more legal options weren't really an option for those involved. But we've already seen a high peak of this kind of activity (at a much lower valuation).\n\nHonestly, given months of reading this, I don't see the value investing case for entering into Bitcoin; likewise I don't want to take the short because of (d) - there's plenty of irrational exuberance out there!\n\nJust thought I'd throw my thoughts out there so people had a change to correct me just in case I'm missing something fundamental. \n\nSo this is probably my last day here. Good luck to all you intrepid travellers on the bitcoin train, hope it treats you well. \n\n&#x200B;",

Chances are it's going to go considerably lower. However let's examine something. If strong hands start hanging onto the majority of the coins on the market it makes the compression more violent on the up and the down. There is less active liquidity. This is also what is going to be a trigger for that violent move down. On the recovery as the price starts increasing you have people at every step looking to lighten up. They sell their coin and this adds liquidity to the market. Maximum pessimism should be reached before summer time this year",

You need adoption for that and adoption is already very high now, considering the fact it's not a payment method but a speculative asset. It's also an 'old' technology and consuming too much energy. It's like the big computers in the 60s. It will be surpassed by a better idea/coin and the cryptomarket will change over time. Long gone are the times of icos and mass hysteria.",

The rich rule the banks, and they rule Bitcoin. During times of economic woes, people are forced to sell their bitcoins to pay for things like Christmas Debt. When they sell them at a low price, the rich, who have billions of cash, just buy them at a low price. When they are ready, and they only, they make a few phone calls to others around the globe and manipulate it to their benefit. \n\nThe 'big lie' about bitcoin is getting everyone to buy into some belief that a world without banks is better. But really, it's still largely controlled by the wealthy elites that run the world. The rest is smoke and mirrors for you and me.",

Keep your emotions in check, it's just an investment, not your child. If it succeeds, it succeeds. If it doesn't, you better get out on time. That's how investment works.

Having gold or btc as a currency will mean the economy will shrink to a substantial degree. And yes, these debts could become a problem, but as long as people are working, businesses are making products and offering services, countries keep trading with eachother and national product increases, there's not much going on. This doesn't mean crypto with a fixed supply are completely worthless. They could serve as an addition to currency with volatile supply, and as a form of protection against crisis, like gold. But you can't build an economy based on a coin with fixed supply. It could potential be build upon a crypto with volatile supply, but this will not be completely decentralized, and that's something people within the cryptocommunity just have to except. You can't have maximum liberty without somekind of trade-off.",

But you're telling me you are dismissing the growth of infrastructure and the entire crypto ecosystem built around bitcoin. You're just going to pretend that all the development, layering, LN, apps, atms, exchanges, mining companies, beefed up security protocols, proposed ETFs, Bakkt, SEC attention, etc that DIDN'T exist just 5 years ago is failure? \nBitcoin is growing, and it's getting huge. Fuck the price that will continue to change and the high risk speculative investment use has become a big market that there will never be a shortage of participants for. Big players start the first buy in, millions more jump on the wagon, guess the top and take profits... this will never go away and the market has not even matured yet. The brightest developers including Jimmy Song have said over and over that Bitcoin is and will continue to be the best use case for blockchain and they have the most insight any human can offer to date.\nBitcoin has already begun to sync with society and the social collective and nothing short of an apocalypse will stop it. Agree, disagree, it does not matter. It has already begun.",
