            "Text": "My 7 hard-earned tips for newbies in the crypto space (from 3 months of experience)\n\n1) resist FOMO and only buy at the crash - even if it means you have to wait for weeks (what goes up must come down so wait patiently)\n\n2) the small cap coins with small price tag have bigger risk but bigger multiplier as well. If you want stability and low risk, go for top 5 inc. Bitcoin, if you want multipliers and big rewards, go and hunt for good $0.001 and $0.01 coins (be careful though as they carry bigger risk)\n\n3) Don't just HODL - do take some profits when you can. HODL what you truly believe in. A bit of TA and swing analysis don't hurt. Mix the two together and diversify your investment strategy.\n\n4) Euphoria and all-time-highs are not to sit and watch. Stick to your strategy, know what profits you need to take and act. BEFORE it comes down again\n\n5) Don't disrupt your life. Know how much time you are going to give to crypto everyday.\n\n6) don't invest an amount which if it halves, takes your sleep away. Invest carefully. Small investments of $10 and $20 are fine to start with. No shame in it. In fact, small investments are best FOMO-KILLERS.\n\n7) >95% advice in crypto space is just people's opinion. Try to find and subscribe to those 5% who know this space much better than others.",

Not when the trustee is selling whenever bitcoin gets too high. I'm glad we finally found out who caused the crash to 6k because there had to be an insane amount of dumping on top of the panic that went on during the time. If the Mt. Gox news never happened bitcoin probably could have reached 25k by the end of the year. But this is seriously going to affect bitcoin for a couple of years. I'm guessing bitcoin will probably oscillate between 5k to 10k unless the trustee auctions the rest to a billionaire at a discounted price or the judge says no more needs to be sold.",

            "Text": "There seems to be a lot of confusion about the Mtgox bancrupcy trustee and his BTC selloff. Here is what we actually know (from official records and information given to people present at the creditor meeting):\n\n- The trustee sold around 36k BTC + 36k BCH between December and February. The average price was around $10.4k/BTC.\n- The proceeds from the sale almost exactly equals the total claims filed (where 1 claimed BTC is fixed in value to ~$460. In fact, it seems that after reaching this threshold the trustee stopped selling.\n- The trustee still holds ~165k BTC + BCH. He announced he MIGHT sell more in the future after consulting the court. \n- No mention has been made of how other bitcoin forks  under the trustees control will be handled.\n- The addresses for the remaining Mtgox Bitcoins are known. If the trustee moves them, anyone watching the addresses will know.\n- At the moment the court is contemplating moving Mtgox out of bankruptcy and into civil rehabilitation, since the rising price of BTC means that the assets exceed the liabilities. The point of this would be to make it possible for the surplus to go to the Mtgox creditors instead of the Mtgox shareholders. A decision is expected in the coming months.\n- A majority of the creditors wish to be payed in BTC rather than fiat. The trustee is still investigating if this is possible according to Japanese law.\n\n",

Every time there is a sell off by these people, it's VERY healthy for the advancement of BTC. You think 12k to 9k is big...imagine at 100k if they sold everything. Better to weaken the bastards now while BTC is still down 3k than to lose 10's of thousands later",

He is new to the space and is genuinely curious, from a tax perspective, how this is all going to play out as the IRS wakes up from 2014. He also doesn't think this tax uncertainty should keep people from fully participating in the crypto market. I hope this helps those who just want a quick $$$ answer on their taxes, and people should pester him to make a free 2017 calculator! Cheers",

Is it purely fear that Mt Gox is still holding on to 160,000 bitcoins and that Japan and China are cracking down on crypto?\n\nIt feels to me people are feeling bearish now because of all the regulations taking place, but after the regulations have been implemented or when the Japanese and Chinese find a new way to enter the crypto market this all will be nothing. For example, after China cracked down on chinese exchanges, those exchanges moved to HK and are now operating with greater volumn than before. People from China would actually come to HK just to buy crypto.\n\nWould really want to hear your thoughts. Please comment.",

            "Text": "I have a question.\n\nAfter months of bloodbath on both sides (BTC and alts). What will happend to alt-coins when BTC is starting the upwards/bull-trend again?\n\nUsually alt-coins go down when BTC rises, since people sell their alts to buy btc to gain value. The last months we have seen alts value plummet down the drain. Do you think alt-coins will go even further down to new levels we haven't seen when BTC rises after this long correction? Or will they stabilize on the red levels they have now?",

What I've seen people do is something like this: 25% at 9800, maybe another 25% at 9600, another 25% at 9400, and the last bit at 9k even....  you might average yourself out at 9500... but it requires less timing that a single purchase... and that bots hate it... they really REALLY hate it... because they want to wipe you out all at once...\n\nThe trick is figuring out when to start and when to end your laddered purchases....\n\ndon't let yourself run out of $$$ if it crashes all over again...\n\nALSO: \"Stop Buy Orders\" should really be called FOMO orders... because you are saying, if the price gets to a certain level, you are afraid that means the train is leaving the station... and you don't want to miss out... (I think that is a good way to get burned on fake bull pumps). ",

However, there is an inverted head and shoulders that might play out and bring us back to $9.8-10k but these patterns have been negated in the past so I would combine that with the lower volumes at $8.3 and pretend that is a quasi-resistance point. These are the times for daily traders. All this is just my opinion of course and BTC has proven to be everything but what the rest of the markets are.\nKeep in mind that the case for a sub $4k is there too. No easy answers I'm afraid. ",

You adjust the bot to just buy enough to get for example 10 points per minute up.\n\nPhase 2: once the price is up 1% or 2%, you start to use the coins you bought and sell by taking the highest bids in the order book. You are already making profit. Of course you continue to buy at a higher rate at the ask side of the order book.\n\nPhase 3: the up trend gains momentum. So now you start to lower the buy rate and increase the sell rate.\n\nPhase 4: you stop buying, but the momentum is still there. So you start to make sell orders in the book, instead of taking buy orders.\n\nPhase 5: you start selling aggressively everything you didn't already sell dureing the pump. this is the dump.\n\nThe End: you now have more fiat **and** more bitcoin than in the beginning.\n\nDisclaimer: I made this up. This is how I would do it if I had enough funds for something like that.\n\n",

First purchase around 11k.  and every few hundred south, I pick up some more.  Disciplined gambling, right?  Low and behold, I run out of $$$ on my last buy - at about 9.2k.  So I've given myself an average of 9.8k on my laddered buys.  But now, I am ALL IN.\n\nAs I continue to stare at the screen, it starts sinking in.  And I think, I can take a loss of 10% here and now - and see if my gut proves correct that I can buy back in next week at a substantial discount which makes my current 10% loss irrelevant in the scheme of things.\n\nEg.  I put $10 in and it is worth $9.  I sell and run with my $9, but buy back in at $6.  Instead of (1) unit at 10, I could have (1.5) units at 6.  And when 6 goes back to 12, I have 18, not the 12 I would earn if I HODL.",

With btc and some basic TA, there is a good chance your bet can still make good if you have enough patience. At least, that is what I try to avoid. I always wait for my stop-buy to be hit, then sell low on the pull back, then rebuy back at my original stop. That way I am guaranteed the loss. Of course, if you are shorting you want to do that the other way around.",
