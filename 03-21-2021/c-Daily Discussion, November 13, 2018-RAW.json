The recent posts are of course very much focus on bch forks (so do us reddit) and the general consensus there is BCH forks will dump.\n\ncontrary to what we think BCH's little pump in recent market price is due to people buying in to get free forked coins, the chineses believe the recent pump in BCH is artificially created by Jihan to make bitmain ipo look less terrible, and to get more newcomers to consider having bch in their portfolio.\n\nTldr: avoid being scammed by bcasher at all cost, even the chineses know this.",

[My own post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/9wpwj2) didn't even get two views. Maybe my submissions are shadow banned? Because IMO it's great and relevant news for bitcoin. It's one of the  most powerful/influential detractors getting sidelined. I can imagine that Bitmain in light of it's IPO, will concentrate more on profit than on silly political games. E.g. by stopping their money-losing tactic of ignoring Segwit transactions.",

            "Text": "With Bitcoin, generally, everyone benefits the most through cooperation.  This is predominantly because it's set up as a \"don't trust, verify\" system.  Every peer (full node) can verify that each block propagated through the network conforms to the consensus rules as they understand them.  If miners choose to not follow your node's consensus rules, their block will be rejected by your node and their effort is wasted.  I would say, in that regard, nodes (collectively) have all the power.  That's not to say a chain split couldn't occur, but the nice thing about running your own node, is that you don't have to blindly follow consensus rules that you don't agree with.",

It's an over-simplification, but you might say masternodes verify the blockchain and transactions while miners expend compute power hashing (incrementing through billions of nonces to find the hash that qualifies as the next block), to give them the right to package up the next block of transactions. \nIn the world of bitcoin only the miner is rewarded with a payout of bitcoin, while the masternoder is  rewarded with only the satisfaction of helping the bitcoin network. Other cryptocurrencies, like Dash for example, reward the miners and the masternoders because they recognize the contribution of both.",

If the specs are to be believed they're not as dramatic an improvement as past generations. With millions of S9s out there, it'll be awhile before the new ones impact difficulty. Lastly, I don't believe they'll have any impact on bitcoin price, but they should have an impact on Bitmain's stock price down the road. Just my two cents.",
