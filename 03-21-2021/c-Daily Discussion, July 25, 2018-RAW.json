If one successful mission is made, it could change views on precious metals. Right now, the assumption is that we know how much gold there is (i.e. supply). So, price is related to demand. But, what happens if more gold is mined in space? Well, the supply changes and that supply becomes speculative. The price should then change.\n\nNotably, just over a week ago, news of over a quadrillion tons of diamonds was found below the Earth's surface. Approximately 24 hours after that, there was a significant spike in Bitcoin. Please search for it to see what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is only my opinion. Do your own research. I just think that as science progresses, precious metals become more abundant. This alters the result of the supply / demand equation. However, math, is relatively constant.",

I wanted to pay as little fees as possible so i converted my funds currency then sent them to the exchange no fee to transfer funds to the exchange and i got a good rate on currency conversion before i sent. using the exchange had no fee's because i was using buy and sell orders that would get filled by someone else not the exchange themselves.",

It's just a site to view charts and draw on them. Because of arbitrage between exchanges, the price is almost always the same across all of them for Bitcoin, so it almost doesn't matter where you buy it. You just need to find an exchange with fees that aren't bad. Most people in the US start with coinbase, and everyone else probably starts on bitfinex.\n\nAnd making small plays, I assume you mean buying, only helps you if you keep doing it for a long time. If you are just getting in, you should only be buying with the intent to use BTC to buy things, or to hold onto it for a while. Many people have lost their asses trying to predict future prices, so be careful.",

If the actual exchange rate is 1 dollar to 0.85 euro, many atms will give you a much worse rate, like 1 dollar to 0.65 euro and the bank that owns the ATM will pocket the difference.\n\nIf you're not careful about checking exchange rates when visiting a new country and using the atms, you can get hit with insane markups on the exchange rates.\n\nIf you think about bitcoin ATMs as exchanging one currency to another, the higher fees make a bit more sense.",
