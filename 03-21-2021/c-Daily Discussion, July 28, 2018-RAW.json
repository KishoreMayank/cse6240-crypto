A corporation that perhaps manufactures mining equipment and runs \"testing\" phases for years on the latest models, before selling the inefficient old models to the public, for example.\n\nWhat if these same people had the power to remove tether from all the major exchanges, what would the vacuum of tether do to the price of bitcoin?\n\nI know everyone wants an ETF to happen because the hype will drive the price up. But if every bitcoin was worth 1 million dollars, multiplied by investment in other financial instruments such as an ETF, that is a DEFINITE investment (to an even greater magnitude) into something we think MIGHT be decentralized.\n\nUnlike Gold, bitcoin is designed to go up in value. Its not apples to apples in terms of economic security; if we heavily invested into bitcoin it could disrupt our current society if an advisary controlled most of the bitcoin. How are bitcoins made? Where do they come from? Does anyone control most of the bitcoin hashrate? If they do, how much bitcoin do they have? \n\nThis is why the SEC has rejected the ETF so far to date. Not because they're jerks, or they're old antiquated men. Their concerns are real. Bitcoin doesnt need an ETF to go up in value. An ETF would just add fuel to the fire, a fire that could heat up marshmallows or catch fire to your home.\n\nTL;DR who is holding all the chips?",

Should wave-e equal a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c, it would do so at around $7,958 (BITFINEX) \u2014and converging trendlines of the triangle suggest by mid to late JUL. It is common for this final wave-e of a triangle to either undershoot or overshoot the converging trendlines of the triangle. However, this wave-e must terminate below wave-c for the overall triangle to remain valid; i.e. below the MAY high of $9,990 (BITFINEX). Summary of targets to complete the triangle (BITFINEX):\n\nTextbook:\n\n     @7873: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 50% of wave-d\n     @7958: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c    \n\nOvershoot:\n\n     @8372: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 61.8% of wave-d\n     @8557: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.786% of wave-c \u2014REACHED WITHIN $50\n     @9084: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 78.6% of wave-d\n\nOnce the triangle completes, the second leg, and most devastating leg, of the cryptocurrency bear market is expected to resume with a breakout in volume and volatility \u2014the crash redux.

An incredible return on investment but not enough to even pay rent for a month. And bitcoin will not hit 1million in a year, or probably ever, and I\u2019m quite bullish. More possible but still somewhat outlandish would be $100kUSD per coin. Your $5 is now worth $62.50 minus fees and taxes.   This is just simple math. It\u2019s not hard.

            "Text": "Yeah, so there are two things to consider.   \n   \nFirstly you're going to find similar wealth distribution in most asset classes, and it is what's called Pareto distribution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution). This isn't even due to the specifics of the economic system, but more of a natural law which applies to multiple phenomena and it's sometimes simplified as a 80-20 rule (which is somewhat inaccurate, as the scale is exponential but gives you the right idea). For example:   \n* 80% of the company's profits are generated by 20% of its customers   \n* 20% of cities contain 80% of the population   \n* 20% of the words in the language account for 80% of text written in that language   \n* 20% of the stars in the universe account for 80% of its entire mass...   \n   \nTherefore Bitcoin's wealth distribution is not anything Bitcoin specific and is characteristic for most wealth in the world (https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/07/global-inequality-tipping-point-2030). In fact Bitcoin doesn't even look that bad in comparison to some assets, so the argument that this particular Bitcoin's characteristics makes it worse than other assets is invalid.   \n   \nSecondly, the manipulation of the market is greatly exaggerated. Sure, it likely does happen in an unregulated market like crypto, but in practice any attempts to manipulate the market on a large scale are going to be unprofitable, if not impossible due to the very way of how the market works. For every one whale wanting the price to do one thing, you have a hundred or a thousand that want it to do something else. So, unless you believe in some giant conspiracy between most of the market participants (which: a) would be extremely difficult to implement in practice; b) we have a competing sub which specialises in this kind of thinking), the end result is always the aggregate of all the actions of all the actors and at no point is fully known or intended by any individual one.",

If the coin price hits half a million or more as many have  predicted, these people would be placed in a situation of unimaginable wealth.",

            "Text": "It's too soon for retailers to adopt it yet. Most online sellers have no incentive to accept it, and ecommerce solutions with Bitcoin integration are nowhere near mainstream. Then smaller retailers wouldn't even know how to buy it themselves yet. What is the proven equipment to accept it physically on site? There's much more to overcome than the volatility of the price... there's simply just not enough confidence in the entire process of paying with and accepting cryptocurrency. \n\nIt takes time and expecting retailers to invest in the acceptance of Bitcoin which they need to convert back to FIAT to integrate with their day to day finances is not reasonable. Maybe the average person in this Reddit group thinks Bitcoin use is common, but only a very tiny percentage of people even think of paying with Bitcoin, and thus a tiny percentage of any retailer's customer base. That doesn't provide a retailer with any incentive because it doesn't make any real difference to their sales and bottom line.\n \nIt would be reasonable to assume it's about 5 years out, but also very reasonable to assume it's coming. This is not a price volatility or transaction speed, or even a fee issue. It's common sense, because businesses need to turn profits, so once Bitcoin acceptance helps to I create sales, then you will see retailers accepting it globally. It needs more time, and once it really starts, adoption will accelerate.",
