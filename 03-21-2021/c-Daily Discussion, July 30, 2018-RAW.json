Two Indian exchanges have announced that they are launching P2P crypto trading services which will allow traders to buy and sell crypto legally even after the central bank\u2019s ban.**\n\n**ragiantex.COM** **P2P Service** \n\n**ragiantex.com**\n\n**With the banking ban by the central bank set to take effect on July 5, Indian crypto exchange ragiant.com has been working on a solution for users to buy and sell crypto without needing a banking service.**\n\n**The exchange announced last week that it is launching a P2P crypto transfer service which it claims to be \u201cthe most legal way to buy/sell cryptos in India after the** **RBI** **ban\u201d.** \n\n***The buyer and seller can deal with each other directly while RAGIANT acts as an escrow account for holding the cryptos during the transaction so that neither party cheats the other.***\n\n**RAGIANT releases the crypto to the buyer upon receiving a confirmation from the seller, he noted. \u201cWe verify the KYC details of every user before allowing them to trade on RAGIANT, and keep a record of each and every transaction that occurs on our exchange.\u201d**\n\n**Launched in March, RAGIANT currently supports the BTC trading pair**\n\n**With over 100,000 users currently, he added that his exchange is the \u201cfastest to list those many coins in India in such a short span of time.\u201d**\n\n**Planning for** **RBI\u2019s Ban**\n\n**The P2P trading service will launch once the** **RBI** **ban takes effect, Shetty explained. According to the central bank\u2019s circular, the ban prohibiting banks from servicing crypto businesses will commence on July 5.**\n\n***People have been worried about how they would convert their fiat (INR) to crypto and vice versa. As soon as we announced P2P there was a big sigh of relief as users in India realized there are alternatives to the ban.***\n\n**Five known petitions have been filed with the courts against the** **RBI** **ban. The supreme\u00a0court will hear all cases on July 20, except for one petition which was filed by the Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). This petition will be heard later. \u201cAfter considering the urgency, the supreme court decided to hear this one out on 3rd which is before the** **RBI** **deadline,\u201d\u00a0 ragiantex is a member of this association as are some other major crypto exchanges such as** [**www.bittsbase.com\u00a0\u00a0and**](http://www.bittsbase.com%20%20and/) **Zebpay also starting p2p services in India** \n\n**YOU CAN BUY AND SELL BTC AFTER RBI BAN ON EXCHANGES THROUGH** [**BITTSBASE.COM**](http://bittsbase.com/) **WHICH IS ESCROW SYSTEM\u00a0\u00a0the most legal way to buy/sellcryptos in India after the\u00a0RBI\u00a0ban\u00a0peer-to-peer model to facilitate virtual currency trade without using normal banking channels**",

Should wave-e equal a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c, it would do so at around $7,958 (BITFINEX) \u2014and converging trendlines of the triangle suggest by mid to late JUL. It is common for this final wave-e of a triangle to either undershoot or overshoot the converging trendlines of the triangle. However, this wave-e must terminate below wave-c for the overall triangle to remain valid; i.e. below the MAY high of $9,990 (BITFINEX). Summary of targets to complete the triangle (BITFINEX):\n\nTextbook:\n\n     @7873: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 50% of wave-d\n     @7958: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c    \n\nOvershoot:\n\n     @8372: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 61.8% of wave-d\n     @8557: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.786% of wave-c \u2014REACHED WITHIN $50\n     @9084: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 78.6% of wave-d\n\nOnce the triangle completes, the second leg, and most devastating leg, of the cryptocurrency bear market is expected to resume with a breakout in volume and volatility \u2014the crash redux. Taking out $7,330 may commence the second leg of the bear market, at which point signals time to exit ALL cryptocurrencies.\n\nInitial expectation for the second leg bear market is towards $4,257 (BITFINEX).\n\n\n\n____\n**^https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/913xx6/2018_cryptocurrency_crash_elliott_wave_redux**\n\n^#10kNeverAgain, ^#9kNeverAgain",

In 2019 it will go back to 7000, before a new bullrun begins end of 2019/beginning of 2020. It will be a 25 month bear market, which was expected. Almost all alts will die (98 percent). ",

Alts bleeding is almost certainly a good thing and analogous to *priming the pump*, regardless of whether it bulls now, next week or 6 months from now. The more alts bleed out in the interspersing time, the better off everyone is. The fact that alts ballooned so much and are still very ballooned (in my opinion) means that the markets are a long way from healthy. Need to burn off this mania more before smart money gets back in.",
