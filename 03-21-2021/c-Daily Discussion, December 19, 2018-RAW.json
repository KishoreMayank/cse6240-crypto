It's saturation is so tiny compared to where it's going to be within the next decade. Whales can do their thing. Hell, they're going to be doing their thing for years to come, that's a given, but their pumps have always been the catalyst for bullruns in Bitcoin. If they see indication of momentum they'll obviously wait to dump a higher price just like they did last year. Why dump 4k when you can dump 10k, or whatever.",

            "Text": "It's going to take a while because a lot of people bought bitcoin at > $10k. A LOT. Some bought even what they couldn't afford to. People with zero investing experience. They just saw the news headlines and FOMO'd in. And it's not too hard to hypothesize that a good portion of those people have not yet exited or only partially exited at a loss. What we witnessed this year was the reverse of last year, FOMO replaced by FUD. When the market starts to recover, it will be met by floods of people exiting, so we're looking at quite some time here.",

While there were long positions being closed, there were around 150mil worth of short positions being liquidated since Sunday, these two factors raised the price, and earlier today we saw the price action pick up as the bulls continued to buy and the short positions reopened and began another selloff. An almost picture perfect bull trap... short positions reopening means a decline in price as they selloff the btc, the long positions will probably continue to decline as the sentiment behind the market continues to dwindle.

There is no happy ending to virtually a $730 BILLION DROP over the course of one calendar year. This is not a bull run. It\u2019s a clear pump - I predict between $165 billion and $205 billion range. After this pump, the whales will dump it hard again but I don\u2019t believe it will be much lower than $3.2K. How can you be so optimistic in such turbulent times? Do you have Stockholm syndrome?

LTC makes a good testing ground for new Bitcoin features. And, to be honest, I love how much faster it is at confirming txs.\n\nThat said, 90% of my crypto is BTC, with a little ETH on the side.",

We don't need to repeat the same old song and dance on this.

Do I put a great deal of money in Bitcoin? Of course not! But I enjoy this market. It's my money and my time and my opinion. You really should not carry so much weight in what I or anyone else express on here. It's all speculation and will be for a very long time. There's far bigger things in life to stress out over.
