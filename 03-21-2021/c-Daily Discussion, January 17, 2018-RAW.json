            "Text": "I wanna talk about the Network fee currently.\n\nSo I tried buying some Bitcoins for the first time last night. I used a Debit Card via coinbase and apparently I \"own\" 0.00448092 BTC ($48) Coinbase takes a 4% commission so I spent $50 and got $48 in bit coins. (approx)\n\nThe first thing I wanted to do was go find ways I can spend them. I used the Bitcoin FAQ thread stickied at the top. I tried going to greenmangaming.com, they don't accept them anymore, I tried going to Steam, they don't accept them anymore, I tried going to Humble Bundle, I think they had a link but it was disable with a message that said not accepting them due to the volatility. Tryed going to Gyft, couldn't login for some reason so gave up, tried going to newegg, not accepting them anymore, tried going to overstock and holy cow!!! they accept bit coins!\n\nSo I tried checking out and realized that overstock is using coinbase as it's bitcoin payment processing system but at least I could spend a bit coin there.\n\nSo now I wanted to see how to get my bitcoins off coinbase so I read up on software wallets for my phone. I landed on Airbitz and installed it and started it up. I wanted to send my bitcoins from Coinbase to the wallet. The wallet took a long time to setup an address for me but now it's there.\n\nSo to send my bitcoins to my wallet I tell coinbase to send it to the address on my phone. (had to email myself, copy key, paste into coinbase window)\n\nThen I saw the Network fee. Approx $10 USD of bitcoins. And after doing some research that network fee is simply how this all works... in order to make a transfer that is real that fee is involved.\n\nIs that correct? In order for a bitcoin transaction to happen the network fee has to be paid so that the transaction is recorded by all those mining computers right?\n\nI'm pretty sure this also means that the $50 I spent on coinbase is not a real bitcoin transaction until they transfer it to my wallet then, correct? How were they able to purchase bitcoin for me for $2 (4% of $50) when the network fee is $10? (approx) Can they create transactions without paying the network fee because they're a \"miner\" themselves?\n\nAssuming 1 person has a bitcoin in their wallet on their phone and another person has a car worth 10k USD and wants to sell it for 1 bitcoin, the first person could scan the address of the person with the car, then send him/her 1 bitcoin, and the network fee would come out of that transaction?\n\nSo all transactions cost at least $10? (approx right now) Is that how this works?\n\n",

I think that would require some of the hysteria about it going to zero to wane, though.  A little too much short-termism going on.  If it gained 1% a day for the next 60 days, it'd be cheek to jowl with 20k again.  I always use GBTC stock to take the temperature of bitcoin.  Currently trading at a 75% premium to the NAV.  That's pretty bullish.",

I know something that my friend from South Korea told me: he said all banks currently have restrictions placed on them (forcefully) in regards to crypto currency transactions. However this temporary restriction will be lifted on Jan 20. (Actually to be more precise- regulations will be in place to register the person with the bank with proof and documents) Coincidentally this is when the release of the new South Korean coin is released: ICX... right on the 20th. \n\nWhat do you guys all think? Coincidence or no? And my friend is telling me crypto will not crash in Korea, and not as bad as everyone is taking it to be... as far as he and his group of friends are concerned. ",

Nothing that will make me be able to retire but enough that, after a minor rebound will certainly help me with rent.\n\nI'm jsut not sure how to get it out of slushpool.com into my wallet.  There is no wallet on file that I see but i click on the \"Payouts\" part for Bitcoin and \"your address for receiving rewards\" but when I click that, nothing happens.  Nothing happens to most of what I click.  I'd like to be able to get this where I can sell it when it rebounds.\n\nCan you help?",

My entire bank account only has $180 the last time I checked and I am lucky enough to be staying with my parents who will also fund me through college. I've been buying BTC when it was near worthless with my soulless retail jobs and accumulated enough BTC to almost become a millionaire when it reached the peak of almost 20k (not sure because I was away on a volunteer trip to a place without internet for quite a while). But if the price had reached 21k I would have become a millionaire before I reached college. But now the price has gotten down and I don't know what to do. If I sell now I can still realize a lot of returns compared to my initial costs, but I can't help but keep thinking that if it almost reached 20k it could reach again and THEN I can cash out and become a legit millionaire. Any suggestions on what to do? I'm not in the US and there are minimal capital gains taxes here so I'm good on that. ",

Each time is different, but I've successfully identified the near bottoms before it has bounced back over the last five of these. \n\nI've pegged this bottom at around $8500. I'd be surprised if it goes through that. There's no real good way to exactly pinpoint, because we are talking probabilities and wide variance here. If you are looking to buy, I suggest now is as good a time as any to start pumping.\n\nThe questions you should be asking are 1) does it have a better chance to go higher or lower from where it is now, and 2) what are my alternative options?\n\nBitcoin has a much better chance of doubling to $20K before it halves to $5k at this point. There aren't many other options that can do that, so yes, I'm buying.",

So I have invested only what I can afford to lose. But then the dip came. And all the \"buy the dip\" speeches came too. So I made another buy at 13k. Now I have invested a bit more than I can afford to lose. But it's still ok. Happens that at this moment I have the chance to buy more BTC at 9.something. Looks like a great opportunity to me but I will be leaving my \"ok to lose\" zone. If everything goes wrong I won't be losing my lifesavings but it will hurt. What do you guys think?",

It's gone 10 years without major adoption as it pertains to what it was created for: a digital currency. \n\nI've only read up on it and a few other currencies briefly but it's apparent that Bitcoin is inferior tech and all other \"generation one\" crypto tech will be disposed of along with it.\n\nI guess my question is how much media steam do you think Bitcoin has left? Maybe the implementation of lightning network and other sidechain development and that's it? I'll ride the hype 6 more months before I think it is too much of a gamble.",

Technically then, even on a downslope it's possible to day trade successfully. Though I don't recommend it, that's basically what is happening right now. Bitcoin went down to 9k and people speculated it would go back up, possibly to 10k, before it continued going down below 10k.",

Most people holding Bitcoin were doing it for the gains, not because it's useful as a currency or because the technology is interesting.  This is pretty apparent even reading enthusiast subreddits like here, where most discussions were about Bitcoin's price (e.g. HODL), not the technology (or the problems with it).\n\nSo for all the people holding Bitcoin as an investment, when the price goes down from one single bad news, a lot of those people are going to cut their losses (or perhaps say they've gained enough).  Which further reduces the price and causes even more people to sell.\n\nThe question is, how many of them are going to come back?  And how many new people are going to invest?  Now those answers nobody knows.  But if Bitcoin can't be shown to be a sound long-term investment, then maybe not that many.",

I believe this technology will be used long into the future and even after it becomes the main tool for trade it will continue to evolve.  My hope is that there is no end.  I am not here to flip coins for a profit. I am here to accumulate tools for future use at a more optimal price than when they become mainstream. As far as bubbles, yes we were in a bubble and yes that bubble obviously popped.  The problem is everyone refers to the bubble as being this huge over all bubble between $0 and $20k. I see smaller bubbles. There was a bubble between $15k and $20k that popped a while back.  Yesterday the little bubble between $10k and $15k popped. When bitcoin shoots up it creates excitement and little bubbles form and eventually pop.  This does not mean we are headed back down to $100.  If you didn\u2019t sell at $14k you are too late.  Just hodl until the next bubble forms. There will be many bubbles to form and pop on the way to $1mln. ",

            "Text": "> Can someone tell me what is the use of bitcoin with transaction fees of $25?\n\nBitcoin isn't practically useful with these fees, it's just useful for those who want to try and make money.\n\n> Also is it possible for transaction fees to drop in the future or is it something hard coded into the algorithm?\n\nHard-coded, but both SegWit and the Lightning Network fix transaction fees somewhat. Whilst it's an unpopular opinion, and I am going to get downvotes, there's no denying that Bitcoin cash, a fork which increased the blocksize from 1mb to 4mb, does have lower transaction fees. That is a fact. Whether it'll prove effective in the long-term is yet to be seen.",

Welcome to the swings of crypto. I haven't been in here long but I quickly realized these wild price swings have long been a part of these markets. Don't sell yet if you're looking for short to mid term gains, as it'd obviously be at a loss. If you're looking for long term gains, 1 month is not long term. So stay calm and don't sell.\n\nMe... most my purchases as of late were at the $16 - $18K range. Those were my buy targets when I sold at $20K. Obviously, I bought back in too early. Right now though, I'm reviewing my finance sheets and looking into the coming months to see how much I can responsibly afford to buy more during this dip. \n\nInvest Responsibly.",

Although as I'm I'm sure you'll hear, you'll end up spending more on electricity to power your rig than you'll make with your bitcoin. Mining another cryptocurrency may be more yo your liking as you'll get a better return for your time and you could always exchange it to bitcoin in the end (still won't be profitable, but better than bitcoin)\n\nI always recommend watching this [video](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4) to those wanting to learn more on how bitcoin works. It does get a little technical but it's not too hard to follow and does an excellent job in explaining.",

So when when you \"bought\" BTC on coinbase all that happened was you got a ledger entry on their system and a commitment from coinbase that says we'll let you control X number of their bitcoins. Until you transfer those bitcoins to your wallet, you don't really own them and there is no record of any transaction on the blockchain. To get a transaction on the blockchain = US$10. This is one of the fundamental flaws of BTC, in that it is a resource constrained network. This is the reason you can't buy things with gold any more, the cost of the transaction made it unusable. The BTC community knows this but now you've got two equally dumb responses to it. One is that BTC is not a currency but is instead a store of value (except it has no other utility) and the other is lightning network (a complex technical solution that will cause centralised payment processors). Fun to watch though.",

How were they able to purchase bitcoin for me for $2 (4% of $50) when the network fee is $10? (approx) Can they create transactions without paying the network fee because they're a \"miner\" themselves?\n\nWhen you purchase off an exchange like Coinbase they have the bitcoin in one of their wallets, if you want to take possession you pay the network fee.\n\n> Assuming 1 person has a bitcoin in their wallet on their phone and another person has a car worth 10k USD and wants to sell it for 1 bitcoin, the first person could scan the address of the person with the car, then send him/her 1 bitcoin, and the network fee would come out of that transaction?\n\nIf they are selling a car for one Bitcoin the buyer needs to send them one Bitcoin and the fee. The sender is responsible for the fee.\n\n> So all transactions cost at least $10? (approx right now) Is that how this works?\n\nYes.\n\n",

This is a more precarious situation, but gives them more freedom to control the money supply.\n\nTrust in bitcoin is manufactured by the way it works. Because it is itself knowably scarce, it doesn't require backing to prove that it's not being inflated. Because it is itself valuable, it doesn't need its price pegged to another asset. ",

Just like electricity or the internet, Bitcoin is a technology that is changing dramatically the way we function as human beings, how we transfer value between us. Volatility is induced by those who just want to get rich, panic sells are orchestrated by whales who know exactly what kind of people recently entered the market: uninformed, anxious and inexperienced \"traders\" who WILL sell their coins for a loss, basically handing money over to those willing to be patient. \n\nThis is the story of Bitcoin since the beginning and with the crazy amount of people rushing to the market is only gonna get worse.\n\nHowever, when Bitcoin reaches mass adoption and acceptance by the majority of the world, volatitly will be a thing of the past. Why would the world accept Bitcoin you might ask, well because it is simply better, cheaper and more efficient than what we have now.\n\nRemember, there were sceptics of the internet, electricity, even fucking toasters, there will always be resistance to innovation, it is simply our self preservation instinct kicking in. That doesn't change the fact that innovation always win.",

You all got your wish, bitcoin went 'mainstream' and the public has watched, with much curiosity, as bitcoin climbed enormously, peaked, plateaued, and is now starting to crash, spectacularly, just like all the financial experts in the media coverages said it would. Those foolish enough to buy in during December at the height of the get-rich-quick hysteria, are now looking at 50-60% losses, and are probably desperately trying to figure out how the hell to pull whats left of their money. You only get once chance to make a first impression, and cryptocurrencies have really shit the bed. When the dust has finally settled, the public opinion of bitcoin is going to be, at best, that it was a classic  speculation bubble for the greedy and ignorant, and at worst, that the whole thing was just a big scam. It's going to be a long time before anybody, other than the absolute diehards, will be prepared to put money into cryptocurrencies again.",

            "Text": "Increasing block size increases the cost and complexity of the network and prices some miners out of the market, driving centralization of the network in the hands of a smaller number of owner/operators. This reduces the security and resilience of the network and makes it more prone to manipulation/tampering. This is a sliding scale, however, and in the long term block size increases will probably have to happen. \n\nIn the near term, the plan is to get a 'layer 2' instant payment upgrade rolled out ('Ligntning') and get the exchanges and wallets to support SegWit, which is an optimization of the block contents that allows more transactions in a given block without increasing its size. These will allow for a very substantial improvement in on-chain transaction cost reduction and practically free off-chain transactions for instant retail payments (the kind of thing you'd do on a typical credit card, Apple Pay, Android Pay, or what have you). \n\nOnce those happen (Lightning is moved from 'beta' to production nodes connected to mainnet and SegWit is everywhere) we will have a better view of how much the block size *must* be increased to support demand for on-chain transactions. Block size increases are a 'last resort' option for dealing with scalability.",

            "Text": "Bitcoin mining nodes and user nodes don't know who owns them, so it is possible for a malicious actor to secretly acquire control over a large number of nodes. The only durable means of preventing this is for there to be so many nodes distributed among so many unrelated owners that it becomes logistically and organizationally impossible to control all of the nodes. \n\nThis is why increasing block size is a very dangerous way to increase scalability: increasing the cost/complexity and resource requirements for nodes will make it harder for unaffiliated participants to deploy and operate nodes on the network. Ideally, we'd like every person to run a full node on an appliance in their home so ownership of the network would be as widely distributed as possible, across many individuals in different geographies with different electricity and Internet providers, in different jurisdictions (different governments), different political views and party affiliations, different religions, different languages, etc. \n\nThe network needs to be extremely large and owned/operated by the most diverse sample of the population possible. That is what protects it, not just the blockchain.",

In 1992-94 (early days of the internet) one of the arguments was that the internet would never work because  no one would be able to find anything on it. Well guess what some guys invented Google.

It's basically under heavy load, think of your computer having 100+ programs running and the resources being utilized at 100%.\n\nSecondly, no transactions arent normally that expensive. It's possible to move coins around for far far less. You can move them into an alt coin (ethereum, etc) and those are faster/cheaper due to less load and possibly design. You can also use GDAX which will cover many of your fees. It's the same back end as coinbase.\n\nFinally, that wallet you chose is probably hot garbage. Pick something else. ",

And it's a hell of a lot more exciting than doing the same in a Casino; Plus I dont have to travel.\n\nIs this the norm or how it should be? Probably not, but it's what I do, and if the asset drops to 1%, it's still more than the $0 I've got my current stake valued at.\n\nThat all said, I don't think my held coins are going to permanently collapse; But who knows? It's a gamble and I acknowledge it as such. I'd rather lose $100 across a few years of BTC rising and falling in exciting moments and dramatic newsstories than seeing it immediately disappear in a hand or few of Blackjack. ",

It's slow, transaction costs are high, it doesn't scale, it's bad for the environment, you can't get refunds, it's too volatile, it's deflationary, hardly anywhere accepts it, you can get hacked, it might soon be illegal in many places, etc. \n\nIt would only have underlying value if there weren't any alternatives and there were something you couldn't buy with any other currency. Fiat currencies have this because you have to pay taxes in that currency. Bitcoin has the fact that malware writers sometimes demand ransoms in it, but bitcoin isn't even very good at that because it's not truly anonymous.\n\nThe only thing bitcoin has going for it is that it was the first crypto-currency and therefore currently has the widest adoption and brand recognition. But people who actually want to use a digital currency will want one that is fit for purpose. Furthermore they don't really want to buy into a world where the Winklevosses (or the person who wrote the code for your alt-coin) start with all the money and there's no way of redistributing it.\n\nIf crypto-currencies take off then it's going to be in the form of government-backed, regulated coins, the hypothetical \"Fedcoin\" etc. This doesn't fit with Bitcoin's original ideals; bitcoin's ideals may have some residual value to some, but this might not be worth so much once there's a coin that really works better than current payment solutions (cash, Visa etc) and is government-backed.",

They may be excluded from the typical banking system, but they work hard and have the same aspirations and opportunities you and I have. \n\nAnd just to wrap it up.  Few people truly understand that being poor is expensive and onerous.  A poor person pays more for housing (per sq. foot), healthcare, education and often relies on shark loans in times of need, hits  a \u201cpoint of diminishing returns\u201d in terms of earning power.

That said I'm all in right whats left of my profits, first time to post but long time lurker I've held BTC since 2013 and lost a bunch of money then forgot about it until this yar unfortunately I couldn't HoDl and took my 100% profit after recouping those 2 year loses around April...  Since then I still have skin in th gam, all pure profits I play with, I also sold 1BTC before CME go live at 19k and bought a Rolex, lucky me.  Anyway I'm not cashing out anymore, this money needs to grow or die with this market!",

At the time we had just seen a large jump after CBOE options trading started, and we were on the cusp of CME options trading starting.  All indicators were that it would go up realistically to around $25k.  Should I have sold at 17.5k and eaten the loss.  Maybe.  While right now this really sucks, I think I'm going to ride it.  The money I invested came from the sale of some work stock which I was given, somehow it seems like less of a big deal since it wasn't money I had in savings, but it still isn't fun.  I refuse to sell and lose half the value, call me stubborn or a fool, maybe I am both. lol.",

Again - don\u2019t listen to jackasses like this. \n\nMy advice is to dollar cost average this dip. If you plan on putting another $1,000 in - maybe do it in 3 or 4 separate purchases. That being said, conventional wisdom is \u2018time in the market beats timing the market,\u2019 so there\u2019s no shame in putting in the full $1K and continuing on with life outside of crypto. \n\nEdit - I am an experienced holder ",

The question of the development of the code. I only programmed a tiny bit when I was younger but I remember having to compile my code into an .exe after every little update. This means that all of the new changes were hardcoded in and the old exe was discarded. Can I think of Bitcoin like this? If an update or implementation is needed Bitcoin will have to \"hardfork\" into a new project and build on to the code or else it will have to have developments done in cooperation with the core bitcoin code? I.e. lightning network being developed on its own and will have to channel/interact with Bitcoin's core code?\n\nI guess what I'm saying is Bitcoin's framework is rigid and can't be updated freely if it wanted to change major things without hardforking?",

Most of the people that have bought it have not used it.  If they had, they would not have bought it.  Why buy something that does not practically transfer?  Bitcoin has a huge market cap, because the media hypes it and it was first.  Low knowledge investors are prone to manias and pile on to trends.  And they are competing against hardened pros.",

In my extremely short experience you can't buy much with it and as it gets more valuable ....is becomes harder to spend!?\n\nIt's trading like a commodity, like oil for example, but as it gets more expensive it's not more valuable as \"oil\" ...it's less valuable because no one wants to accept it as payment and no one wants to spend it on smaller items because of the fee?\n\nAm I correct? Is it reasonable to expect the trading volume to go down in the future?  (which would make the computers less busy and the network fee might go down?)",

Out of that rapid evolution came Ethereum, due to solving the Turing completeness problem. Developers that wanted a faster, more advanced, and more capable coin and system moved from Bitcoin to Ethereum.  Blockstream came on line, funded by AXA and other Bitcoin-specific businesses that could not pivot well to other coins. Who is left in Bitcoin, how capable are they, to what is their allegiance, and how psychologically stable are they? You have to decide this for yourself, but many have decided to move over to Ethereum to get away from the rot.",

Bitcoin has always managed to bounce back from it's past spectacular crashes because there were always more suckers waiting around the corner to buy in. Back in early 2013, it was just a geek / tech thing, then it blew up in Asia, prompting the 2014 bubble, now it's gone mainstream, there was an article on the BBC the other week about people in Africa buying in for goodness sake. This is it, the moment the ponzi collapses, when it burns everyone this time, there is nobody left to give it another shot.

Some one industries might analyze the trades to see if you have some form of market manipulation.\n\nAny way, Market Cap for a currency is pretty meaningless.

You might be right in that the stock market will continue to thrive but I can't help but think there is going to be a collapse soon. The middle class is not doing so well which spurs much of our economy. Considering the value of the USD has fallen by 10% in 2017 and wages have not increased by 10% this year there is going to be less buying power coming out of the middle class which can effect companies.\n\nAll politics aside I am a very bullish person but I think there should be cause for concern in the future.",

            "Text": "> PC wallet is 100% protected if I will not lose my code\n\nThis also applies to mobile wallets as well (though I don't know which ones). Basically when you set up your wallet it gives you a seed, a passphrase of a few words that is like the password of your email, because your coins are online (don't know where exactly, this stuff is complicated). This means that if your PC or smartphone die or are stolen you can still access your coins if you put the seed on another device with the same wallet software.\n\n> the disadvantage is that I can use my BTC only on this particular device.\n\nNot necessarily, for instance I use Electrum (considered to be the best wallet) both on my PC and my Android phone.\n\n> Online wallet is more convenient, but it is risky, as wallet provider can take control over my BTC.\n\nThat's right, not worth the risk in my opinion.",

But at the same time silver and cooper was very easy to make into coins. So why did they choose gold? because its rare. Bitcoin is very rare. Gold wasn't suitable for trading because it was too cumbersome so they switched to gold backed notes. Then with government deficit spending they had to get off of the gold standard because they couldn't afford it. ",

            "Text": "I don't think the point is valid at all. The \"Don't invest recklessly\" post was first posted at $3000, and it didn't cause a crash. It was then posted a second time at $10,000 and stayed stickied for around three weeks. That didn't cause a crash either. Notice that the title of the thread is \"Don't invest **recklessly**\", not \"Don't invest at all\". \n\nPersonally I think the rally just ran out of steam naturally, except that it was cut off prematurely due to virtually every exchange collapsing under the weight of extreme demand. Recall that Coinbase hit $19,000 before crapping out completely for several hours. I suspect that Coinbase ran out of Bitcoin to sell, but that's speculation because they had to halt trading several times. The demands on infrastructure were also very extreme. But if the exchanges had been able to keep up, then I think we probably would have seen $25k without too much trouble... but the hype likely would have been exhausted around the same time and we'd be roughly where we are now.

Such an interpretation is only one of a number of interpretations of probability and there are other statistical techniques that are not based on 'degrees of belief'.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

            "Text": "> I'm very confused why people expect a currency with such a high fee to use is going to continue climbing at this point. \n\npast performance. It's near it's all time high and had an amazing 2017 where it exploded. People expect it to repeat. \n\nThe coin has a use beyond currency. It's still has use as a storage of value if it holds/grows well. It's also a source of strong speculation. There are also software updates that will help the blockchain scale. This includes shit like the lightning network, which may or may not take off and be a solution.\n\nI think your general idea about fee's being too high to make it of use as a currency or a bartering unit for small amounts of money is true but that's still only a small portion of the picture and as you saw....it was like that a year ago but that didn't prevent the price from exploding.\n\nThe real answer is nobody knows why its going up or down. Tons of variables and market manipulation by whales and investment bankers. It's not reasonable for you to expect trading volume to reduce. It's been going up by a ton. The thing is, most trades are on exchange platforms. ",

I use bitcoin to buy things when it's portion of my total assets goes above my threshold, like it did in the recent run up. And buy a little at a time when the percent is low.",

But they fail to see that the average person barely makes it from pay check to paycheck, they don't need Bitcoin to store savings they don't have. And as a currency, it's not the cheapest virtual currency to use, and will probably never be. The average person doesn't care about network security, they will use whatever has the lowest fees. So my thoughts are that when you value Bitcoin you will need to think of it as a niche product, never try to value it based on usage by the total global population.",

It\u2019s a shame that it is happening but it\u2019s more annoying that it does not have to.  There\u2019s no need to keep increasing miners indefinitely.

            "Text": "A metal is deemed to be precious if it is rare. The discovery of new sources of ore or improvements in mining or refining processes may cause the value of a precious metal to diminish. The status of a \"precious\" metal can also be determined by high demand or market value. Precious metals in bulk form are known as bullion and are traded on commodity markets. Bullion metals may be cast into ingots or minted into coins. The defining attribute of bullion is that it is valued by its mass and purity rather than by a face value as money.\nGold and silver, and sometimes other precious metals, are often seen as hedges against both inflation and economic downturn. Silver coins have become popular with collectors due to their relative affordability, and, unlike most gold and platinum issues which are valued based upon the markets, silver issues are more often valued as collectibles, far higher than their actual bullion value.\n\nAn initially precious metal that became common is aluminium. While aluminium is the third most abundant element and most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, it was at first found to be exceedingly difficult to extract the metal from its various non-metallic ores. The great expense of refining the metal made the small available quantity of pure aluminium more valuable than gold.[6] Bars of aluminium were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1855,[7] and Napoleon III's most important guests were given aluminium cutlery, while those less worthy dined with mere silver.[6] In 1884, the pyramidal capstone of the Washington Monument was cast of 100 ounces of pure aluminium. By that time, aluminium was as expensive as silver.[8] The statue of Anteros atop the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (1885\u20131893) in London's Piccadilly Circus is also of cast aluminium. Over time, however, the price of the metal has dropped. The dawn of commercial electric generation in 1882 and the invention of the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process in 1886 caused the price of aluminium to drop substantially over a short period of time.\n\n\n\nIn the last nine months of 1979, the brothers were estimated to be holding over 100 million troy ounces of silver and several large silver futures contracts.[26] However, a combination of changed trading rules on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the intervention of the Federal Reserve put an end to both their holdings and their potential for profit on the commodity. By 1982, the London Silver Fix had collapsed by 90% to $4.90 per troy ounce.[27]\n\nIn 1979, the price for silver jumped from about $6 per troy ounce to a record high of $49.45 per troy ounce (on January 18, 1980),[28] which represents an increase of 724%. The brothers were estimated to hold one third of the entire world supply of privately held silver (not counting the silver held by governments). The situation for other prospective buyers of silver who had not stocked up on the metal in advance of its bull run was so dire that the jeweler Tiffany's took out a full page ad in The New York Times, blaming the Hunt Brothers for the increase in price and stating that \"We think it is unconscionable for anyone to hoard several billion, yes billion, dollars' worth of silver and thus drive the price up so high that others must pay artificially high prices for articles made of silver\".",

Why not take a Xanax and leave Reddit for awhile? There's more to life than defending your reasoning over why memes are so good and getting angry at internet strangers. \n\nIf you lost money and want to rant about it, go shout into a pillow maybe. Take a nap; Maybe the price'll be back up when you're awake. \n\nOr if you think it'll keep crashing for the next week and hit $0 feel free to shove it in my face in a week; But I'm willing to bet a week from now we see the usual crawl back upwards.

            "Text": "**Asset classes**\n\nAn asset class is a group of instruments which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets. Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true. For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the underlying instrument but are subject to different regulations than the underlying instrument.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
