Bitmain and the other handful of Bcash bagholders seem to have capitulated for now at around 0.08.  \n\nIs this relevant to Bitcoin?  I say yes, immensely.  We've been held back by their market confusion. \n\nDid you know that if you download Ver's Bitcoin(dot)com wallet, you can only find the BTC wallet features under advanced settings?  Just how many innocent newcomers has this confused?  I daren't even go into the advanced setting of my X M R wallet, and I'm not a crypto beginner.\n\nBastards.",

Shorting bitcoin is like shorting the S&P or tech companies Netflix, Facebook, Amazon - not adviseable. Also markets tend to go up over time so you might correctly predict the crash/correction but miss out on timing and be down money. Shorting is best when you have some insider info on a fraud, dissapointing financial reports, or security breach that's not yet public.",

If you can point me to actual empirical evidence of TA being useful I would appreciate it. Despite hundreds of years of people practicing TA, there is no more evidence that it works than there is for astrology, palmistry or any other comparable pseudoscience. Something isn\u2019t true simply because many people believe it is. It is possible that some people believe that they made their fortunes by following the advice of oracles and fortune tellers, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are correct. They may simply have guessed right - random chance is very hard for humans to see with the naked eye. We always prefer narratives and causation over random chance and intuitively see connections between things that don\u2019t really exist. That\u2019s why the scientific method was such a monumental innovation - without it we\u2019d still be living in a world of spirits, gods and fairies.",

Shouldn\u2019t it be possible to say that \u201cxx% of the time the Head-and-Shoulders pattern correctly indicates a price move of xx%\u201d, or some similar statement? Why doesn\u2019t anyone offer a quantitative description of a \u201chead\u201d and a \u201cshoulder\u201d? \n\nIf you used only chart data, and crafted an algorithm that was able to correctly trade even 1% more accurately than the next best alternative, how many trades would you have to make before you won all the wealth in the market? Do you have a guess about why that hasn\u2019t happened, despite centuries of trading and millions of traders looking for this magical, unfair advantage? TA is the result of human cognitive biases.

If I say this stock has 40% to go up in the next three days and 60% to go down, and it goes up - it's not a failed guess. And \"maybe they got lucky\" argument doesn't work for 20 years of results. TA is not some magical 8-ball that will provide you answers, it's just a tool to help you understand what's going on, and economics is not a hard science it's just a study of psychology on a macro scale, anything that claims to have \"100%\" certainty is full of shit. TA is like setting up high speed cameras and software to crunch coinflip physics that allows you to have a 51% of certainty on which side the coin will land on, a lot of effort and complexity for very little advantage, but that advantage is worth it.",
