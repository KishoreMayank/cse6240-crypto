Even the most complex smart contracts would, on the blockchain, typically be indistinguishable from regular transactions.",

            "Text": "Good video from 2015 predicting the 2017 Bitcoin $10K price stating that Bitcoin from here on is on a logarithmic progression not linear. And I totally agree with this chart which predicted Bitcoin would hit the $10K (5 digit milestone) near the very end of 207. The next milestone is $100K which this chart predicts will occur in mid 2021 (so June 2021). However, based on 2018 massive bear market, I\u2019m not totally convinced. I think the chart can ring true with the announcement of a Bitcoin ETF...which if that occurs, Bitcoin will easily surpass $100K (maybe $300K). But, there is no momentum now and Bitcoin is not obligated to hit $100K in mid-2021 functioning on the logarithmic scale of a hypothetical chart.

Failure in investments is nothing to beat yourself up over. Many of us have lost like you, some with much more dollars at stake. IDK your age but if you\u2019re young consider saving and investing in a balanced portfolio that will garner many times compound interest over your lifetime.

That is a tiny, *tiny* drop in the bucket compared to larger, more traditional markets. \n\nLet\u2019s take gold, for instance. You could easily argue that Bitcoin is better than gold in almost every way. Gold has a 7 trillion dollar market cap. Bitcoin could easily take 1-2 trillion away from that, no problem. Let\u2019s shoot real low though, and say it only takes 500 billion. That right there is a $25k-30k BTC, easy. And that\u2019s just gold. Now think of all the potential money that can flow in from stocks, bonds, currencies, etc. \n\n$100k Bitcoin is easily attainable, it\u2019s just a matter of when.",

            "Text": "> I have to wonder why you reiterate this theme of being a loser and a failure.\n\nwell, i have failed at everything i have done, for the last decade at least.\n\nabout three years ago, i was barely getting by (making about $9K a year) with dreams of working in the entertainment business. It (clearly) was not happening for me in that business, so I gave up any hopes of finding my dream job.  So, after giving up what i wanted to really do because i wasn't making money at it, at all, I decided to do something totally different.  I spent a year taking classes, training, and getting licensed to sell real estate.  I thought this would be a good choice.  2 years ago i started work at a real estate brokerage, and over the last 2 years I have earned about $12.5K a year (and I work full time).  Others who joined the company at the same time are making between $120-150K/per year. So, here i am, 53 years old, making less money than some kid at Mcdonalds, and no idea what to do next?  Do I keep trying at real estate, even though its been two solid years of financial failure?  Or do I figure out something totally new?  Like I said, i am 53, and I just wasted the last 3 years.  I only mention these things (not because i expect an answer, but because that's what I'm thinking about these days, what to do?).  I am willing to try something new, but since everything i try I fail at, its hardly like i feel excited to try something new.  I don't even know what i want to do?  My life has been at least 10 years of solidly failing at everything I try (and my love life? LOL I am actually fit and attractive, but how many women do you know that want to date a 53 year old guy who rents a room, and makes $12.5K a year?).  I am just tired of years and years and years of failing with not even the most basic level of success at anything.\n\nI rolled the dice on bitcoin, although you're right, i know its not a big deal, its just that fact that its just one more failure in my life thats nothing but an endless stream of failures.\n\nAnyway, sorry to ramble (I think i really wrote this more for myself to clear my head, and get these ideas out there for me to see) and thanks for your kind words!\n\n:)\n",

The few buying right now aren't looking to sell in a few months for a 15% profit, they are going long.

I worked like hell at a new career for the last two years (I became a real estate agent), the first year i made about 20K, this year i did even worse, and made about $9k (yes, for the entire year).  Other agents who joined the same company at the same time are making $120-150K this year.  So, by all measures,  i have totally failed at that job (I am now going to have to try something new, or do what I do in a totally different way - whatever the case, i worked HARD and yet still failed).  Additionally, I have failed at romance.  I am actually fit and relatively attractive, but do you think that in Los Angeles California there are ANY decent women that want to go out with a 53 year old guy who makes $9K a year?  So, i am a failure at love and dating.  I'd love to have a family and kids, but see previous example, you need a good woman first.  So, I now have no decent job, no idea what i want to do (something truly terrible like being a 53 year old uber driver seems like the only option), no idea where i even want to live (being a grown man who lives as a roommate in someone else how isn't exact a self-esteem builder, either), and feel like a loser because everything is doing poorly in my life.  I once had dreams of working in film and TV as a writer or performer (but i have long since given up on that failed dream, too) These days my biggest dream is just to say fuck trying and just go live in a van (so yeah, my dreams are not even good).  And hey, you think i want to re-invent myself all over again? I did that (most recently) three years ago when i started real estate training, one year of training, then two years of financial failure working as a real estate agent.   So... sorry to rant (I guess i'm just mostly writing this for myself) but in a purely empirical sense, i am a loser.  thats just the facts.  To think otherwise would be to be in denial.  I don't even have any terrible vices like drinking or drugs to blame my lack of success on, and I definitely don't see a path to becoming a winner (or happy) from where i am now.  Nonetheless i am trying to figure out how to be happy, or a non-loser.   I'll just have to see what happens in the future.",
