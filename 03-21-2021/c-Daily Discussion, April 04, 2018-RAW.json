No new money means price won't rise (enough), which means people will lose their patience and sell, bringing down more and more holders with them. ",

Not since the internet was released, Bitcoin is the most important invention the world has ever had, and [almost] no one knows it yet.\n\nEveryone can video chat for free, to anyone across the world. Now, with Bitcoin & blockchain technology, practically \"anyone in the world\" can send money directly to \"anyone in the world\" (in a Trusted & Decentralized way) without using a costly third party (like PayPal).\n\nThey say, it will happen despite of the level of belief & understanding -- just like in 1994, when people didn't believe \"Internet shopping\" and \"Email communications\" would work for the masses.)\n\nNote: The population of the USA is ~320 Million People; and there are only ~16 Million Bitcoins in existence. The World population is 7.4 Billion People; and there will never be more than 21 Million Bitcoins in existence (which will happen around 2140) ~ Everyone can't have \"more than one\" Bitcoin.  (When will you get your \"more than one\" 1 Bitcoin?)",

The drop was amplified by new money being concerned of a sharp drop in value, causing even more selloffs.

If your money is trapped in cash it will lose 2-3% annually to inflation. \n\nIf it's in stocks you risk a down market and most people aim to get 7-10% gains per year. \n\nBitcoin has value as a store of...value. USD may or may not exist in 50 years. Bitcoin and gold probably still will. In the interim you can change it to whatever currency you need to materialize goods and services in your life.",

If things go bad, sell sell sell. \n\nNow, if you are a small time guy like me, and you have bills, seeing you lose your 10k when you have bills suddenly becomes a big deal. If you got 5k in the market, and 5k in bitcoin, loss is loss and you panic and pull your investments out because it's sinking, regardless of the status of bitcoin.\n\nYou are making the assumption that people are buying for HODL and really they are buying to make money today, because bills are due today. \n\nDoes that make any sense? My point is TLDR that investors are investors, and it doesn't matter what the stock or currency is. They invest to make money, and if the market bears, so does the currency. The whole concept of 'if the markets tank currency will not' is complete fallacy. The first thing someone does when they need money is sell crypto to pay rent. If the market crashes, crypto will head right there with it.",

Cashing out fees are much higher than trading/transfer fees because fiat is involved, so this helps the fee problem too.\n\nWhether or not the above will happen is one of the big questions, but there is also a common argument that bitco doesn't have to be used directly as a currency to be valuable, if enough people adopt it as a store of value.

Every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds.\n\nFor many of us, we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices. Every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying $2000 Bitcoin becomes  farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm.\n\nRespecting the support level of Feb 6th is a pretty big deal for me. Because if it doesn\u2019t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price.\n\nGratitude for the people who haven\u2019t sold. It\u2019s a sign of solidarity that I admire.\n",

The most exciting part of all this is that it's still so new that nobody knows what bitcoin is yet! They don't know if it will live, die, become a currency, or a store of value.\n\nBut, its staying power isn't out of the question.

You people are like televangelists preaching prosperity theology to desperate people looking to get away from a life of poverty for some financial freedom. The reality is Bitcoin may NEVER hit 1 million, but if it does, it\u2019s a very long time from today. I think by Jan. 2022, Bitcoin will hit $40,000 which is a very realistic projection based on past trends. However, that excites no one especially by suggesting that Bitcoin will first experience tremendous stagnancy for the next few years. I predict by Nov. 2018, Bitcoin will be $4000. Today, it\u2019s about $6800. This news does not excite anyone even though it\u2019s far more realistic than your bullshit.",

When in Europe the national currencies switched to euro, there were special calculators for people to make the transition, because everyone still thought about value in the old national currency! In Belgium for example, a bread costed 1.5 euro... And everybody was calculating: 1 euro = 40 francs, so that's 60 francs for a bread. Okay. And even today, in 2018, family sometimes talks about big amounts in francs! \n\nNow this is what happened with the switch from national currency to euro, which was supported by the government, they issued special calculators, posters, campaigns etc etc. This is never going to happen with a switch to bitcoin. If such a switch were to happen, it would take so many decades...",

There is significant organic buying interest again I think because some people were expecting freefall below 5k. Didn\u2019t happen.   Bottom is somewhere in the 6k range.   \n\nThe reason we are lower today is due to the irrational reaction to sudden FUD of the Chinese tariffs and stock market volatility. This is temporary and really has nothing to do with bitcoin.   I think once this passes bitcoin will continue its steady upward rise until 8k. Then it will accelerate.  I\u2019m hoping for a slow steady rise after that but could start spiking as fomo kicks in.  ",

When well known top holders are telling you that Bitcoin is going to 100k or 1 million each, they create a FOMO.  This is no better than a Ponzi scheme.  In just the last month, Bitcoin is down more than 40%.  There were so many sell signals all the way down from the top but FOMO turned these fools into HODLers.  HODL in my opinion is Holding On Despite Logic.  The exchanges are prone to hacking, scams abound, no regulation=no recourse, the blockchain technology is free, it is too volatile to be used on a wide scale and yet people pay $6800, $10,000, $15,000, $19,000 and more for one coin out of 21 million.  It is a shame because I believe most of those that bought at the higher prices did not have the money to lose.",

The price approaching major resistance level and then going back down is not a \"trap\", since most traders (as opposed to gamblers) are not going to open positions before the breakout is confirmed, and therefore won't become \"trapped\". I keep seeing bull traps and bear traps mentioned here every day, even though there are none in the charts.",

It's all hypothetical and not real. When people say that it's going to be 100k in 6 months, I am like, it was 6k for the last 6 months, so what is different? That more banks in China said so? \n\nI agree that the technology is amazing. But you are asking people to give up two things: CASH which they will never do, and PAY EXTRA to convert their paychecks into Bitcoin which it MORE difficult to buy things with. There is zero added bonus, and well, people are lazy. Just as Apple Pay failed to gain enough marketshare, but was a great idea, so too will be bitcoin. \n\nEverytime I watch the videos with people talking about global currency, one thing strikes me as odd. They keep talking as if the United States and global economies are going to suddenly collapse, and go to war, and dollars will be worthless. Here is the thing. If I am in America, and the thing collapses, Dollars will be very valuable in America because nobody will have any. We will all be on bread lines and looking for spare change. Electronic currency will be of little to no value because the first thing people do when there is a problem is allow \"ONLY CASH\". Not Credit, Bitcoin, or any other currency. I think the same fo the Euro or Brit Pound. If you are living in those countries and things go bad, having Pounds on hand is where the wealth is, not electronic currencies. \n\nSo while I don't disagree with the premise of Bitcoin, I think it will take a revolution to get it to where it makes millionaires out of the guy who bought $1k worth. By that time, Governments will either outlaw it, or find some way to tax it because the Banks control everyone.",
