I understand that was not the original intention but why does everyone seem to think pivoting is a problem. \n\nIf Bitcoin replaces Gold and is never able to replace USD. Why is that a bad thing? Why is everyone complaining so much about the fees? Who wants to even use such an asset for normal day to day purchases? \n\nI do not want to get rid of my coins for fucking coffee!!",

They say my weekly limit is \u20ac15,000. \nAlso, if one is investing monthly or weekly in BTC, LTC and ETH what would be the best platform to minimize fees? I am currently using Coinbase and the buy/sell fees is not very appetizing, but if one is hodling long term Coinbase might be the best option? I'm basing that on the fact that if one is hodling long term one doesn't need to transfer their money and thus making fees not a big problem. However, the fees when buying cryptos monthly/weekly on Coinbase is not very nice. So basically what would the best platform for hodling long term be in terms of minimizing fees? \n\n",

But SWIFT still moves massive volumes of currency during clearance because it IS good for doing that. I see Bitcoin operating in a similar capacity, unless the blocksize issue is sorted (and getting everyone to agree on that is like herding cats, as seen with all previous attempts).   \nLightning is one option for a day-to-day network tied to BTC for clearance, but there is potential for others. Or just for Visa/Mastercard to go 'fuck it' and layer EMV over Bitcoin. That would knock everything into a cocked hat. ",

People are tracking where he is moving the bitcoins, but realistically there's nothing anybody can to do stop him from moving them where ever he likes.  It is currently unclear if he can be stopped from selling/trading them for some other form of currency.  Its possible someone is watching the bitcoins in your friends wallet as well, but highly unlikely.\n\nHOWEVER, if your concerns are serious, and/or the bitcoin amount is rather large, **you should absolutely talk to a lawyer.**",

            "Text": "Initially the value started rising because more and more people saw and started to understand the philosophy of crypto/Bitcoin and what it means for the future.  The value skyrocketed because of word of mouth followed up with mainstream media exposure. There is a limited amount of Bitcoin to own and when people start buying, the supply decreases, the price per unit goes up.  One problem is that most Bitcoin owners are completely clueless as to what they own and what it signifies. They are just jumping on the \"get rich quick\" bandwagon hoping to cash out.\n\nI personally believe that this just the very beginning and the overall value of crypto is going to go much much higher then what it is today.  It is a paradigm shift of how we do business and how the world will work in the future. There is much literature on this so I suggest you do some exploring and reading. Mind you I said crypto, I didn't specifically say Bitcoin will win. Bitcoin currently has the strongest development base and the strongest brand. This is why it is currently on top. That doesn't mean that it will continue to be on top though. This technology is growing and evolving so fast that no one really knows how this will all end up. It is just faith and speculation for now... ",

The main reason for this is that if you keep crypto/Bitcoin on the exchange, you don't actually own it because the exchange does not give you access to your private keys.  An easy way of understanding this is giving cash to a stranger to hold for you. If you give your cash to someone, you no longer own that cash and you have to trust them to give you the cash back if you request it back. Same holds for Bitcoin, if you keep Bitcoin on the exchange, you don't have control of it and you don't actually own it.  With regards to transfer fees, currently there are high fees for moving Bitcoin around from address to address. As far as I can tell the fee is currently in the neighborhood of 6 to 8% per transaction.",

            "Text": "High volume and large transaction fees are making BTC transactions very competitive. BTC can only handle 3 transactions per second, so if there are hundreds of thousands of transactions hitting the network it may take longer to confirm transactions with lower TX fees. Your TX fees act as a \"confirmation priority\" The larger your fee, the sooner your transaction is confirmed. If you set a 100sat/byte TX fee it wont be processed until all transactions with 200sat/byte, 300sat/byte, 400sat/byte, etc., fees are handled. Hope this helped",

            "Text": "Not quite correct. Ethereum has Turing-complete *expressiveness* but is not functionally Turing-complete because of gas bounds, which are extremely restrictive in practice.\n\nBitcoin is also a smart contract platform, but because ultimately the \"interesting\" portion of a smart contract is usually the interface between physical reality and the blockchain (i.e. the oracle component), Bitcoin can handle most useful or practical smart contract use cases with relatively-simple multisignature setups (allowing the oracle(s) to be one or more of the signatories).\n\nEthereum does facilitate application development that vanilla Bitcoin does not support; CryptoKitties is an excellent example of such an app.",

This will be your new permanent btc wallet.\n- open your old wallet that had the btc.  Get the keys that had the coins.\n- find a wallet that supports the altcoin and create said wallet.\n- go to the altcoin wallet, do a \"sweep\" providing the keys from the prior step\n- done\n\nIf you need more detailed help google how to claim bitcoin cash from back in November.

            "Text": "> so this needs to be done everytime I buy\n\nYou don't NEED to do anything with it, but people recommend moving it to a wallet you own for security.  Other exchanges have gone down and been hacked (see Mt Gox or Nicehash) so this paranoia is not without precedence.\n\n> is this process free of fees?\n\nYou can lower/remove the coinbase fees if you move the funds to a GDAX account first (GDAX is the exchange that runs under the hood of coinbase, both owned by the same company).  You'll still have to pay the bitcoin transaction fee though if you want it done in a timely manner.  This will most likely be prohibitively expensive for repeated transfers of low dollar amounts.  Better to move it in large batches.\n\n> what happens when I need to sell bitcoin, I have to transfer it back to coinbase from my wallet to sell correct?\n\nYes.  If you plan on day trading its not worth the hassle of sending it to a wallet and back to the exchange to sell shortly thereafter.  Most people move it to a wallet because they plan to hold onto it for a significant amount of time (months/years).  The market is quite volatile, so if you don't have the stomach to hold crypto for a while I'd advise you not to get involved.  You'll just lose your gains to fees/taxes as you transfer it all over the place.  Also rapid (<1 year) buys/sells will incur short term capital gains taxes (assuming you are in the US) which is higher than long term (>1 year) gains taxes.\n\n> this looks very inconvenient.\n\nThis is why people are simply holding onto crypto and waiting for the usability issues to be worked out.  Once things are fixed it will be much better.  The early internet was inconvenient (remember dial up?) and look where we are now.  The only problem is nobody knows which coin will win the race and fix all the problems first.",

            "Text": "It all depends on how you feel about your investment and what your personal security policy is. Lets say you invest a $100 dollars one week and then another $100 another week, that couple of hundred dollars may not be much to you, so you can opt to leave it on the exchange.  Every time you move crypto off the exchange, that is counted as a transaction to another address, and there are currently fairly high fees (and long confirmation wait times) associated. What I would do is amass a decent amount of Bitcoin/crypto and then move it to a wallet for security and more important for \"ownership\" (look into the previous example that I mentioned in the above reply). If you want to sell and you have a bunch of crypto in your wallet, you will then have to move it back onto the exchange.  Think of the exchange as an intermediary that you have to have funds deposited in so that you can exchange it for something else (in this example back to a Fiat currency). Exchanges are definitely inconvenient, just like on the stock market, if you want to buy stocks you go through the stock exchange and you \"deposit/transfer\" your own money through the stock exchange to acquire stock (of course that process is largely invisible to a typical buyer, but it still happens).",
