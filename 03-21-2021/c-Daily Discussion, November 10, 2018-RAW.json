I privately suspect he is a Bcasher.  I always thought there was something a bit swivel-eyed about him.\n\np.s.  Lady Fuckton is charming though, and by all accounts lives up to her name.\n\np.p.s.  We had that computer wizz, Dr Wright, up from the village the other day to repair our laptop.  What a bore. He told us 'the electricity was going the wrong way through it' and wandered around my study in a pompous manner.  Not much help.  I'll get Mithins to take it to the experts at Walmart instead.\n\nCheerio Bitcoiners :)\n\n^(Edit: names changed for legal reasons.)",

Their price predictions are based on nothing but FOMO. And don\u2019t even get me started with Tom Lee who is the biggest nut. Cryptogrip thinks Bitcoin will hit $1 million this year once Bakkt gets released...any minute now lol. I\u2019ve been accurate all year and Bitcoin will not touch 5 digits again this year and will hit $4800 early 2019. These yuppies who think Bitcoin will make a bull run out of thin air very soon...don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m not FOMO or FUD but we are in a year long drought combined with an upcoming economic recession that we\u2019re due for. The signs are not very good in investing in ANYTHING for the next 15 months (Bitcoin, stocks, bonds, etc). ",

So then why do we see huge peaks and valleys in the historical price trajectory? Please explain what causes interest to go up and down in this volatile manner?\n\nThe logical answer is that price and interest feed off each other but you seem to be adamant that price follows interest.",
