I feel like everyone is playing hush hush, and one morning we all will wake up to a huge media blitz on how bitcoins being traded for over 1000 on the stock markets and other country's are joining the band wagon and push it up to 2,000. There's so many people in high places that have invested into Bitcoin that they would be able to push it mainstream to get back there money, just a matter of when.\n\u2014-\n\n\u2014-\nPumpkinFeet\u2022 3y\n\nIn my uneducated opinion, it is very unlikely to hold for a long period of time at stable prices. Investors are terrified of bear markets as they don't want to see their money shrink. But as soon as the bear market finishes- and there is stability- the fear will disappear and investors will rush in. As soon as they start to do this, signs of a bull market will appear, causing even more investors to rush in, creating a virtuous circle (for those of us who got in before anyway), causing the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\u2014-\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31pv8s/is_this_the_calm_before_the_storm_any_thoughts/",

            "Text": "A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Users\n\nThe Techbros (see also The True Believers) - they're really into the internet of everything.  They think analog money is antiquated.  They're digital 24/7 and money should be no exception.  They're huge believers in the future of blockchain and can nerd out in the technology all day long.  Hodlers highly present. Subset of Techbros are the True Believers that think Bitcoin has the power to change the world, right all wrongs, create equality where there is none.\n\nThe Criminals - Bitcoin is merely utilitarian.  It allows easy transfer in exchange for contraband.  It provides an avenue of commerce for all kinds of illicit behavior from illegal drugs to sex trafficking to terrorism to money laundering.  \n\nThe Day Traders - they're not in it for the tech, they're in it for the rush.  They couldn't care less about blockchain (hell, they might not even understand it). They see a volatile asset that can be exploited for gain.  It could be oranges for all they care - anything that moves this fast can be profited off of if you know how to play the game.\n\nThe Hedge Funds - Institutional traders that agglomerate huge sums of capital that can be then used to manipulate markets.  It's a market and they're going to be present because they can move it or because they can manage the risk.  \n\nThe Libertarians (see also former Goldbugs, and Trumpkins)- fringy right-wingers that distrust central banks, and really, government of all kinds.  They think money should be deflationary and hate the idea that central banks can \"print money\" and undermine the value of their cash.  For some reason the idea of storing wealth in other assets that rise in value never occurs to them and they often confuse assets with money. They're highly resentful that trades in bitcoin are taxable events and hold things like \"taxes are theft\".  The extreme libertarians trade in conspiracy theories about jews and global banking.  In a prior generation they would have been advocating for return to a gold standard - this is the new gold standard to them.  \n\nThe Black Hats - Anarchists (left and right) that want to burn the system down.\n\nAunt Sally - Aunt Sally doesn't know anything about bitcoin really, but she's heard people talking about it and she's curious enough to put some money into it.  Aunt Sally has a lot of questions.  She's a little disappointed in you right now.\n\nFOMOs (see also bandwagonners) - *sigh* these are lambs lead to the slaughter.  They see people around them getting fabulously wealthy instantly and want in.  They tend buy at the steepest part of the chart on the way up, and sell at the steepest part of the chart on the way down.\n\nThe Ruskies - Russians are exceptionally adept at identifying any weakness in western hegemony and then driving a wedge into it.  Bitcoin provides yet another avenue to throw a stink bomb into the system.  Their use is purely exploitative.  ",

I guess thats why so many Blacks especially (and other groups, too) are joining the #walkaway movement.",

As a country, it was and is still bankrupt.  And it's not NATO (that's a fucking military organization).  America owes other governments through issuance of bonds and the biggest holders of America's debt are China and Japan.\n\nIt is because of the international trust in the dollar (and the nice interest that it pays) that America is able sustain it's debt driven economy.  An economy with 5&#37; of the world's population but consumes 24&#37; of the world's resources.  An economy that produces morons like you who takes things for granted and can afford to speculate in BTC, hoping to get rich.\n\nYou want to sink the USD and replace it with BTC?  Let me tell you what will happen before that - hyperinflation and sky rocket interest rates.  Leading to American companies going bankrupt as they no longer can afford the cost of capital, leading to unemployment.  And eventually leading to total collapse of the American economy.\n\nFeel better?  Now fuck off as you have no fucking clue what you are talking about.",
