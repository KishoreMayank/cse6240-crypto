People still buying but with out the volume on the exchanges it could be another factor in keeping the price down somewhat.\n\nAnybody else get that same sense?\n\nThoughts on BTC dipping to $6,500 and finding support?\n\nAll that to be said with the current price it feels like this is yet another opportunity to scoop up some BTC at a fairly good deal?\n\nThanks!",

What a joke!\"\n\nIt takes brass balls to hodl. From the end of 2013 to 2015, bitcoin lost 80% of its value. Imagine someone with six figures USD sunk into bitcoin watching the slow decay, periodically reading articles from Paul Krugman and others calling him/her a fool with the prospect of losing the entire investment hanging overhead. To handle the stress and still act logically with tact and foresight takes iron will and extreme intellectual independence to not be dissuaded from your decisions by the opinions of others. Hodlers, you saw the future with clarity, you weren't dissuaded by the effects of stress and the opinions of others, you bet large sums of money on your convictions, you were right and now you're rich.\n\nIf bitcoin reaches half of gold's market cap in 5 years (assuming that 20% of the bitcoins have been lost) we're looking at a $250k bitcoin. The current price is $7.5k. I've looked at value investing in the US stock market. I can't find anything with such a large disparity between what it should be worth and what it's selling for. Ben Graham's philosophy is that you don't try to time the market, you buy undervalued stocks and wait. This is not a stock; there are no earnings. If a company that paid a dividend was this undervalued, I would prefer to buy that because it would make me rich quicker and with less risk. Unfortunately, there isn't, but there is bitcoin. \n\nI don't think it's even practically possible for a company with a positive earnings to be undervalued by 33x because the undervaluation would too obvious to be sustained.

Bcash used bait and switch tactics and scammed newbies and older people out of millions while adding confusion and distrust to the market. This Federal Investigation is needed so people trust bitcoin again and are protected from people like Roger Ver who thinks he\u2019s protected cause he lives in Japan. I am telling you now, the state Department is talking to Japan to extradite to USA. Trust me on this. Once it\u2019s completed by August at the latest, Bcash will be proven a scam and roger will be before a senate subcommittee and he can\u2019t plead the fifth cause he denounced his USA citizenship after the Waco Texas incident and he was buying bomb material. \n\nBitcoin will become stronger after Bcash and roger are exposed as well as fake Nakamoto in Florida courts. \n\nAndreas Antonopoulos is such a powerful voice. We just wish he would stand up and confront these scammers. He doesn\u2019t like confrontation and I guess he\u2019s grateful for the millions he got after roger made fun of him. ",

Hedges funds are as close to \"an utterly unregulated entity\" as one will find in the financial sector. So long as their prospectus allows, they can put their money into lottery tickets or multi\\-level marketing schemes if they so choose. Short of investing into a banned country such as North Korea or Iran, they can pretty much do whatever they want.",

Maybe if the movie and newspapers talk about the rest of his life you wouldn\u2019t be so ignorant to call him just a con artist. \n\nHe made a mistake as a young man. He was a run away after his parents divorce. From 15-21 years old he committed fraud.  After serving five years for his crime he started working for the US government. 26-62 years old he worked alongside the US government helping and serving his country.  Working against crimes probably longer than you\u2019ve been alive. This is not your common criminal con artist. This man has developed many counter fraud technology. Working alongside the government he has some pretty strong opinions. ",

No - you will want to pay only for the value that he delivered.\n\nAs for scarcity, it is it totally irrelevant unless the demand is higher than what's available.
