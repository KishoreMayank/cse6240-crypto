            "Text": "There are a lot of people who are aware of BTC but do not own btc. The fomo can actually be quite high this time but only once it becomes a bit obvious that reversal is taking place. I think the first shoots of that effect will take place when 5 figures are achieved again and then stronger once 12k breaks. People who are waiting aren't going to wait for the peak to get in.\n\nPeople do avoid knives that appear to be falling but at the same time, it is foolish to expect that they will wait all the way until the peak to get invested again.\n\nThe peak was 19666 and the repeated support line so far is 6k. If that holds then I would say a good estimate of fomo point is the geometric mean which is around 10850. This is where the % gain from bottom is equal to the % gain remaining until peak. So kind of the rational point of entry for those seeking uptrend confirmation.",

            "Text": "Okay so why would \"long term, non speculative investment of miners\" affect the bitcoin price?\n\nAgain, price is the meeting point of supply and demand. If there's more people that want to sell bitcoin than buy bitcoin, the price goes down until the demand levels out. If there's more people that want to buy than sell, the price goes up.\n\nThis confluence happens on an exchange. The price between exchanges is mediated by arbitrage, which uses the same buy/sell mechanism to keep the price as close together as possible.\n\nSo where does \"long term, non speculative investment of miners\" come into this interaction? How can they possibly affect the exchange price?\n\nObviously, it doesn't. Miners spend money in the hope that the coins they have minted can be sold in the future for enough fiat to cover the costs of their business operation and make some profit. They are betting on the bitcoin price increasing, not causing it.",

Not wholly convinced that it's pragmatic unless there is a market for BTC that you can trade in readily.\n\nAnd Ive seen stats claiming that up to 50+% of the world still doesn't use the internet on a regular basis, if at all.  The remaining 50% probably has widely varying levels of tech savvy.  \n\nI believe Venezuela is at around 60% internet use.  I think it's safe to say that at least 50% fo that country is not prepared to use computers as part of their daily trade regimen.\n\nIf you live in a world where only the US and Europe exist with 90% of their populations online and high literacy, etc -- then sure i can see how you may convince yourself that BTC is viable now -- but that is not this worlds reality.\n",
