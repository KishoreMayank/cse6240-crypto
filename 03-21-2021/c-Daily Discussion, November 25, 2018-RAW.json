I'm pretty sure the bottom was reached based on the normal market trend and market sentiment, and based on the Google search results. But when you deal with forks, money can be shifted from within the market to these new coins. The moment the price of these two forks starts to fall, you'll see money shifted back to btc. They're being pumped at the moment by whales who had their money in btc and Bitcoin cash. Every new coin is being pumped by the devs/owners as well. Then the whole thing crashes because they take their money out, leaving bagholders behind.",

            "Text": "I am not a crypto wizard, but here are my 2 cents on the current situation.\n\nI am a long time hodler (my first BTC buy was at 2$) and I've always trusted BTC as the currency of the future, and this dip won't change my mind.\n\nThe fiat transaction fees are huge, the speed of fiat transactions is slow, fiat currency could be manipulated and fiat currency is no more suited with the dynamics of the IT industry. Holding crypto is the safest way to store value and the blockchain technology behind it is the next step in managing global information. These reasons built my trust in BTC and I am not going to fall for the panic surrounding each dip.\n\nOf course, we liked the speed of the bullrun from last year and the dream of getting rich overnight got very tempting. But investing in crypto is a long term affair and it's not for the short term speculators and for the faint hearted. It's not for those who select the /r/bitcoin current posts by \"New\".\n\nSo, I believe the bottom is close and a new ATH is coming - not this year, maybe not the next, but eventually it will happen, and this is all I need to believe in in order to hold tight. I did the same at each dip and I was right. Of course, the market cap will be huge, but the BTC is a tool that deserves that share.\n\nMany people hate BTC because it's in our nature to reject something we haven't got the guts to invest in something that made others rich. Don't feed them. The investors in BTC were the bold, those who believe in future and they put their money were their beliefs were, and this is a merit that deserves its reward. Just wait, until the next bull run and see those detractors massively change their mind. And then, wait for the next dip to see them trolling BTC again. They will do this all the time and falling for them is denying your own convictions. Bitcoins are not tulips. They are maybe one of the most useful tools ever created and you are part of this revolution.",

If I were to offer to buy anything online, and have it shipped to people in exchange for cryptocurrency, how many would consider it? Benefits for you: you could directly pay for something with BTC, and no attachment to your name, so you can avoid the capital gains tax (if there is any left at this point XD ) You also won't have to wait for a withdrawal to go through before ordering something. On the down side, it would require people trusting an online stranger because there is no way to regulate it. I would benefit because I could create wallets not attached directly to my name, and maybe charge a small fee for picking up the item you want. I could even go to stores and pick things up for shipping out. Is this something anybody would consider, or is it a bad idea because it kind of comes off like a scam?\n\n&#x200B;",

Many of these people will buy back in when they feel the bottom is reached and they will make a profit. You need to be more mature in your understanding of Crypto and pay less attention to the BS excuses around \"why bitcoin crashed\".",

            "Text": "The difference though, is the type of pullback. Previous declines were due to a lack of confidence in bitcoin and recovery was due to investors successfully dispelling those doubts. This is not the same thing. Bitcoin has never been through a general market pullback. We\u2019re due for a global correction. It is coming and it\u2019s not a bad thing. But when markets decline, speculative money is the first to leave. And there is still *a lot* of speculative money in bitcoin. Bitcoin will decline a lot more before it sees the floor. No one really knows what the true value of the currency is because it\u2019s impossible to tell who is speculating with it and who has confidence in it as a currency, but holders should be prepared for significant future declines as big money heads for safety. \n\nRecovery is another thing that may be unlikely for bitcoin. Can it survive 2-3 years with prices on the floor? While it had previous recoveries, that is because it was still the shiny new thing with low volume driving high prices. It only reached five figures because big money decided to jump in. When they come back to play in 2022, will those same people be interested in bitcoin? It\u2019s possible, sure. But I think it far more likely that there will be another, more popular speculative investment for big money to play with. Maybe it\u2019ll be another crypto. Maybe it will be space tech or AI or who knows. \n\nMy only point is that bitcoin did not hit $10k and $20k from people buying half a coin at a time and holding. It hit that amount from rich dudes deciding to throw millions at it and soccer moms remortgaging their house to get rich quick. Not from true investors.  So for it to recover, all that money has to come back into play from somewhere. I don\u2019t think it will ever be as popular with the general public again and I doubt it will still be a good speculative play in three years. So unless it sees a massive increase in use from people who believe in it (which doesn\u2019t seem to be happening), I think it far more likely that it will stay well off its peak for a very long time. Hope I\u2019m wrong for all the people holding it as I hate seeing people lose money. But it just doesn\u2019t look good this time around. The context of this drop is very different then previous ones. ",

OK, what about the insane runnup in price.\n\nBTW, there's a clear answer to the difference here - you're just not seeing it.  Enron, Worldcom, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Bros weren't commodities, they were companies.  Companies with huge amounts of overhead, liabilities, and debt.  They failed because they couldn't overcome these liabilities - otherwise they would just scale back.\n\nBitcoin is just a synthetic commodity.  It's always going to have some value.  It won't go to zero.  It may well go to $3000, or $300, or $30, or $3. . .or $0.30 - whatever - at some level it will continue to live on.  \n",

Bitcoin is a finite asset, there are new coins being added to the market everyday helping to drive the price down with this decreased demand,  this is not the case long term,  dca is a good long term strat if you believe the coin could have good long term value. Although if you don't think that's possible,  i see your point,  but no one knows for sure what will happen when all 21 million coins are on the market. Imo it will increase value over time,  but that is the debate.  ;)",

Run up was no doubt based on psychology and  manipulation (by this i mean coordinated pumps; and currently wehn it's falling dumps). \n\nHowever price of bitcoin going up in the long term is a certain in my eyes. As people recognize the positives of bitcoin itself and not focus completely and only on price, more and more will want to have some. In a completely  digital world of the future, bitcoin/crpyto will probably be the only thing that's really yours, that you actually own, so owning some bitcoin seems like the smart thing to do. And since there are almost 8 billion people in the world, all of them will compete with each other for bitcoin which is limited to 21 million. This will make the price move up, it is inevitable - again, my  expectation. The price you speak about, 3000 usd or even way less, can happen long term only if bitcoin is used by only a very small population.     ",

They also used the the 'buzz word' to inflate their social media engagement and generate hype. This is very much like what companies did when they associated themselves with dot com in the 90s to inflate their share prices only to go bust. There were also countless ICO's associating themselves with blockchain to sell their tokens, even though they did not even have a working blockchain at all! So no, to say it has become a buzz word to generate hype is not hypocritical nor is it a false claim. The bitcoin network however, like the internet, has survived all the buzz and all the hype and seems likely to thrive into the years ahead.\nAlso, coders such as Jimmy Song are very vocal about their opinion that Bitcoin and currency use is the very best implementation of blockchain, and the only reason blockchain is talked about.",
