With Bitcoin however, we tend to see the lower value as a 'loss', but technically that's only the case if you sell it when the price is lower than what you paid. \n\nOh, and it does not matter that he's 70, that only makes him wiser because he's seen more of what has changed over the years and what has worked.

Of course nobody knows what is going to happen, just as nobody has known in the past - but it sure as hell seems like there's a setup in the works to liquidate a lot of short positions. Whenever there's been a lot of talk that convinces even the average small time investors like us that something is true, the opposite usually happens. Again, nobody knows, but caution is your friend.",

When gold drops below the bought or earned price for their labor, they sell to ensure profit.  Why hold a depreciating asset? Buying or earning earlier than someone else just sets your ability to \u201chope\u201d longer. Time comes for us all my friend. It\u2019s undefeated and unforgiving! \nOn a side note, We and this generation will never understand why central banks love gold. It\u2019s a metal good for electronics. See no other use cases. Maybe Henry Ford was right. ",

Whether you sell it then, or not, that doesnt mean you haven't suffered a loss.\n\nSame with when a stock doubles in value, you have had a gain (whether you sell it or not).\n\nbut yes, its strange, and its hard for some new to investing and assets to comprehend.  To make it simple for newbies to understand, yes, some say \"you haven't lost until you sell\" as a way to more simply explain that you will gain and lose value through the length of time you hold any asset, and until you convert it back to fiat it doesnt really matter ...but that's not only flawed in valuing the asset, its incorrect because the measure (fiat currency) is an ever-changing in its value as well.",

If I send you Bitcoin, it can show up as a pending transaction in seconds. It then takes about 10 min to get confirmed before it cannot be reversed in any way. With lightning network, there is basically no confirmation time, and the tradeoff is some additional complexity.",
