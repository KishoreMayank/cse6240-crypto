Gox exchange and manipulation of the price down to 0.01.  \n\nMiners have already turned off their rigs because it has become unprofitable to mine for most people at these prices.  I just don\u2019t want to see it crash too much further.  Unless my understanding is completely off base, losing more miners does not seem like a good thing for bitcoin.  I\u2019d prefer not to have to wait 20 years for it to recover from a snowballing catastrophe. ",
