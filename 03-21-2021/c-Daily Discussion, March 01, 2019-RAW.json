Bitcoin doesn't have value unless it's used for transactions, that's what it's useful for. Where do you think the value actually comes from? Does it come from hype? That's called a bubble.\n\nI think this kind of thinking is due to the hodl meme. I'm sorry to break this to you, but the only people who are now rich due to bitcoin investment are people who adopted it back in 2009-2011 (usually to buy drugs from Silk Road). You're like a decade late to the party, this isn't a get rich quick scheme. Crypto has a bright future, but that future is going to be in newer coins. Satoshi's white paper was revolutionary, but the technology has progressed greatly since then. \n\nAlso, you don't know how to invest if you think that holding on to any particular asset while the price drops is a good idea.\n\nI had to get that off my chest.

            "Text": "Time for my weekly Q&A to help me understand Bitcoin.\n\nIf you say 'Clearly you don't understand bitcoin sheesh' and that's your only response, don't waste either of our time. \n\nSo, here it goes. \n\nBitcoin is a closed system. That means, that if everyone in the world converts, and ALL FIAT everywhere becomes bitcoin, it's essentially like living on an island. Let's call this Island, Jurassic Park. \n\n\nPART I:\nNow, on Jurassic Park, people on one side of the island, make $1 per hour, on the other, $5 per hour. I am using $ but assume it's BTC. Now, people making $1 are mad, so they get a little pissy, and want more. People making $5 say that the cost of living where they live means they NEED $5 per hour. What happens over time in this situation? Does it eventually all even out, where a labor hour is a labor hour, and so the richest paid countries will fall into the sea, and the poorest countries will suddenly make a lot more money? Or, on Jurassic Park, over time, everyone gets paid $2.50 per hour for their labor? This is awful for places like the UK but great for people in Mexico, China, etc. It spreads the wealth. \n\nPART II:\nNow, the thing the rich Bitcoin owners want, is cheap labor. So, they want to pay the least per hour, and make the most, so they keep on inching up the prices at their McDonalds. As McDonalds increases their prices, so does the  landlord, so does the super market. The pay actually flat-lines, but the overall cost of living goes up. This actually makes it much worse for the people. The business owners keep on raising and raising. The workers keep making less and less. It's a system that is intentionally rigged in the favor of businesses. Bitcoin doesn't change that fact. The game is rigged. \n\nPart III:\nCan you explain to me, the devaluation of say, American currency, and how would that be any different on Jurassic Park? Like say we swapped dollars for Bitcoin. The people in charge are still in charge (Business Owners) and they can charge whatever they want, and pay whatever they want (minimum wage). How does 'devaluation' work exactly?\n\nPart IV:\nTransitioning from a fiat to a bitcoin, if you are rich, you can just buy up almost all the bitcoin. Then what happens? How is that any different from what is happening now? \n\nFor instance, let's say, that you could take a snapshot of the globe right now. One USD = .75 GBP = One Euro (hypothetically). In this scenario, in this snap shot, let's say we replace ALL currencies with Bitcoin. Like this: One USD = X Bitcoin = .75 GBP = One Euro. In this scenario we basically have swapped out all currency for Bitcoin in this snapshot of time. Now, let's move the clock forward one year, and I bet that the prices of everything go up thanks to business owners, people's pay goes down, and that the currency swap is probably the same relatively. My point is, if you took all the global currency, and matched it to bitcoin, what do you expect to see happen in the future? Is it that the world market will shift, and say, the USD falls but the Yen goes up? The theory is that in the case of Hodlers, if you are in the US you make money, in the case of China you lose money. In the end however, those with the most money, whether it's bitcoin or gold or fiat, will still have the power to enslave everyone else. \n\nThe question I really have, is that so many people here shout all these benefits. And yet, the rich still get richer, whether they buy 50% of the Bitcoin or not. The Winklevoss Brothers will always have more than me, weather it's fiat, gold, or BTC. The only difference is that on the world scale, the Winklevoss Twins would be king if they cornered the market on bitcoins no?\n\n",
