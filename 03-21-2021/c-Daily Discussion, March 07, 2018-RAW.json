And I can't blame people because everyone has their own reasons to HODL/Sell/Buy more. But if you take a step back and look at these things:\n\n* Gox Whale = The sale of assets over time will help remove some of those spike sales we see (eventually)\n* SEC + CFTC = Should help bring confidence to new investors wanting to enter Crypto\n* Coinbase Index = Help/incentivise investors enter Crypto space\n* Binance = Problem addressed and resolution scheduled\n\nI can truly see it leading to a stronger foundation for Crypto over the next few years. And I think anyone still able to HODL who bought at the ATH will make decent profits over time.",

Didn't think it would go that low tbh. The last time it touched 9.4k was the last bear run at Feb. 24. If it does manage to break 9.4k then bitcoin's next support will probably be at the mid 8k.",

That might have worked for the first 8 years, but crypto, just like everything else, changes. The rise in December was the breaking point for most of the financial sector. They finally \"got it\" and they have poured in. What does that mean? It means we have hundreds, if not 1000s of hedge fund managers in this now, people who are extremely risk adverse and who control significant amounts of capital (i.e. they can make the market move). They buy BTC at $9k and they sell at $11k. If they control just a 1000 BTC (which is EXTREMELY conservative) they just made $2MM for their clients. Why the hell would they HODL?!? They are fine with playing that $2k gap from here until the market gets big enough that most of them can't move it anymore (i.e. that's when it gets into the tens of trillions). BTC is not going to $20k this year, in fact I'd be surprised if it hits $15k. If you HODL in the market how it is now you're better off just unfollowing groups like this, putting your BTC and whatever else coins you have on some offline hardware and coming back in 10 years. It's a waste of your time and everyone else's to keep screaming HODL when all that's going to amount to is you seeing your portfolio increase by $2k one week and being down $2k the next (rinse and repeat). You have to play their game or just seal everything up, leave and come back in a decade and tell us how rich you are because you held.  I'm sorry to tell you this, but if you don't want to trade you're probably not going to make jack s%$t this year, or next, or next. I'm not saying you shouldn't throw some $'s into this coin or that coin on dips and keep building, but the cold hard truth, just like in the tech boom, is that most of these coins aren't going to make it, and (spoiler alert) BTC probably won't either. It's King now...and so was IBM. Who the hell is going to wait around for 15 minutes waiting for their coffee at Starbucks while their BTC transaction processes especially when there are dozens of other coins designed to do it faster with lower fees? Things change, so should you.",

I'm up 10% fiat, while BTC is down ~2%, nano is down around 35%.\n\nI've been studying day-trading pretty seriously for the past 3 months, made many mistakes, and learned many lessons. Still too early to determine if I'm actually profitable long-term, but I'm slowly gaining more confidence.\n\nPrice action, support and resistance, consolidation patterns, over bought / sold and divergences (both of these in conjunction with support/resistance) are the profitable topics to study.

Newbies have been burnt and are broke, day traders probably continue as normal, and hodlers also probably have little new capital to invest after dec, and given we are only a couple of pay checks into the new year for some.\n\nEnd of this month into April I would expect some new money to come in after the relative stability of the past 6-8 weeks. Nice climb into August, maybe a dip in sept and ATH for the final Q.\n\nAgain just my opinion but I don\u2019t see how the whales can manipulate as much if there\u2019s nowhere near as much fresh money.

If current trends hold with $2-$3k rises followed by a mirrored \"crash\" happening even every 4 weeks instead of the 3 in 5 weeks, you could turn $10k into ~100k this year. If you HODL, you'll most likely have what you started with. This isn't a judgement of you personally. I don't know you and you may be the hardest working MF on this subreddit, but to me HODLing is just a lazy way of saying, \"I have a little bit of money, I don't want to do anything, now make me rich.\" It might work, it certainly did in December of 2017, but I don't want to risk my money on what happened in the past. I believe what I've outlined above is the way things are going to go, and I still want to make money, so I have to adapt or I'm going to get boned, and frankly I'm tired of getting boned. I'm going to do everything I can to try and turn my little nest egg into a lot more of a nest egg by December 2018. I just don't think HODLing is going to make that happen.",

They bought for example 100 VIACOIN, hacked the accounts of x number of people through API keys, market sold whatever the account had for bitcoin, and bought the over priced VIA off their hands, getting bitcoins into ONE account to exit the exchange. I don't know if they got out of the exchange, but they definetly hacked it.",

If that quote is from an official Binance rep, it has significant meaning because it means Binance has investigated this and has come out with a conclusion.  If it's from a random Redditor, then that part of the quote has no weight and is just some conjecture from a random Redditor.\n\nHe/she is posting that quote without attributing the source, and some people may mistaken that as coming from an official Binance rep (it appears it isn't).",
