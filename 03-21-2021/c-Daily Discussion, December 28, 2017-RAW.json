            "Text": "I see a fair number of people in this sub say they hold bitcoin because they \"believe in the technology.\" Are they referring to blockchain technology, or bitcoin specifically? \n\nIf the former, then why are are they so married to bitcoin or even cryptocurrency more generally? Isn't bitcoin merely an application of blockchain technology? I can see the value in blockchain technology (abstracted away from cryptocurrency), but don't understand why that's necessarily tied to bitcoin and cryptocurrency (which I'm personally less interested in).\n\nIf the latter, then why bitcoin and not some other coin? I can think of reasons to prefer bitcoin over other coins, but those reasons aren't based in the technology. ",

            "Text": "Don't you think it would be nice to just fall asleep for a year and wake up to see Bitcoin at $50k. I'm starting to get so tired of seeing and hearing all the FUD and bearishness on social media and in the mainstream media. \n\nWhat has happened in the last couple weeks? \n\n* BTC crashed due to an attack from BCH and Coinbase where large market sells from whales drove the price lower and triggered more and more stop losses and panic selling \n* FUD coming out of South Korea crashed the price 10% in less than an hour despite the fact that the regulations were reported weeks ago\n\nPerhaps I am the only one who sees these as huge positives for Bitcoin. For one, despite the high fees and clogged up network, Bitcoin survived round three of Roger Ver's hostile takeover attempt with Bcash. \n\nThe South Korea news seems to just be stating that you will have to use an identity in order to trade on an exchange, you have to be over the age of 19, and regular people cannot invest in ICOs. I don't see how that can possibly justify such a big sell off. Why does everyone panic at the smallest mention of regulations? This means anonymous whales can no longer manipulate the markets as easily. That is a huge positive. \n\nNone of the fundamentals have changed. None of the tech has changed. If anything, we are in a better place now than we were a few weeks ago since Segwit awareness/adoption is slowly increasing, and there is a Lightning Network release candidate that is currently being tested on mainnet and hopefully will be released in 2018. \n\nDespite all this, all I hear is about how the price will drop to $8k or lower. I think it's a bunch of traders who have exited their positions and are shorting Bitcoin and are creating an echo chamber. \n\nI've seen Bitcoin bounce back from worse, and I see no reason it won't be able to do it again.

Recently I've seen news about a fork called B2X, and previously there was the bitcoin cash fork that most people here say is a scam. My question is, with the existence of the \"fork\" method of innovating, is there any need for any altcoin? It seems that anyone who was going to do something cool with a new cryptocurrency could just fork bitcoin and have nearly-instant adoption since the fork would honor all previous bitcoin transactions. In fact, it seems to me that Bitcoin could be updated indefinitely simply by forking it and allowing the holders to decide which branch to follow. Creating a new coin would just increase volatility and slow down the adoption process. ",

The whales are 100% controlling this price flux right now.  They are putting the squeeze on us all.  At one point I genuinely thought BTC would climb to over $25K but I\u2019m doubtful now.  Too many noobs came into BTC and bought at $18K+ and freaked out and sold it back in the low $12s to $10s.  The whales gobbled up hordes of BTC.  This massive price drop has scared off an entire investor class. The whales are preparing for a mass exit.  I own a small chunk of BTC and am debating when to get out.  I do not know when but my gut tells me it\u2019s relatively soon.  I truly wish I were wrong but I cannot shake this feeling lately.",

I even picked up some at 12.5k. Those TA people have been wrong in many cases, but in this case, I had a hunch they were onto something once it fell below $14k.

There are many ways to read what Satoshi wrote and interpret it. Whether you feel he would find decentralization more important, or fast cheap on-blockchain transactions more important will influence your interpretation.\n\nI *personally* feel that Bitcoin Core is more closely aligned with Satoshi's motivations and vision, but that's me.\n\nWhat are the motivations of the people that wanted BCH? Well, the biggest motivation I can find is it preserves ASICBOOST and profits for Bitmain. This increases centralization which damages one of Satoshi's main goals -- decentralization and no need to trust an intermediary.\n\nEDIT: I guess you have to ask three questions: 1) What aspects of bitcoin are most important to you and 2) what aspects are most important to the success of some flavor of Bitcoin? 3) What's the best way to balance those things?",

Annyoing, because I was not checking that properly until now, I thought the selling/buying price will be slightly different than the one shown in the chart, but not by 2K! \n\nIs there a way in coinbase to put a price limit for buying and selling?

Right now him giving you bitcoin is giving you a choice. Hold it (which means for a year st least you don\u2019t have the money in your pocket) or sell immediately and deal with the taxes etc yourself. Either way you aren\u2019t getting 11k. You\u2019ll either get less, or maybe in a year have a lot more. But if you don\u2019t know anything about bitcoin, setting up a wallet, where to buy/sell, what it is etc then you have no business accepting that offer anyway. You would fuck it up or get scammed and end up with nothing. If I were you I\u2019d demand flat because he owed you in fiat. Like I said he can cash out, pay you, and pay the taxes himself that\u2019s not your problem ",

Bitcoin's smart contact abilities are growing gradually, for example.\n\nBitcoin gains features at a more sedate pace, but that's a good thing, just look at some of the huge bugs that Ethereum smart contacts have hit.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Transaction fees are high at the moment, I would recommend accumulating on an exchange and moving a large amount at once. Fees are not proportional to the amount you send. In other words, sending 10$ and sending $1000 will result in the same fee. So by saving up on an exchange until you have 300+ or so, will ensure you don't get eaten alive by fees. Fees will hopefully decrease in the coming months. ",

            "Text": "Everyone's style and risk tolerance is different. From what you're describing, it doesn't sound like active trading is necessarily the best for you at this time. But regardless of what you want, I think the first important step is that you only bought an amount which you don't REALLY care about. \n\nIf the amount is causing you anxiety, my first suggestion is don't panic...we could easily see 17k next week. But if its absolutely unbearable, trim your position by rounding down a little. E.g. if you bought like $1,400, trim to $1k. If you bought 15k, trim down to 10k. Whatever.\n\nSecond, this is just a thought, but consider buying some SPY (if you haven't already) so that your investments include some U.S. equities, which are not perfect but also not nearly as volatile. \n\nThirs, if you really want to get into trading, take an amount that is really small, or even make a paper account (is that a thing for BTC)? Take like $500 and just start day trading, but understand that you need to keep fees low becasue they'll kill you. Expect to learn a hard lesson (e.g. lose money) but at least then you'll have your taste of trading and be able to decide if its for you.\n\nIn short, yout BTC LTC ETH strategy is perfectly fine though.

There isnt enough new money coming in, the people who are going long have already bought, the people buying the market now are those trying to time the pump and dumps in the market and playing the short game. Nobody would buy for a long position at this price because you are really only going to see a max of 100%-130% return. Especially if you compare with altcoins, why would you play the long game with bitcoin? You could double your potential returns if you wait a while and buy back at 10k",

With how much trouble it's having consistently staying above $14k, I'm actually ready to sell some Bitcoin off in the event we get the temporary spike at about $17k.  \n\nAnd This market is full of people who just have no confidence in Bitcoin. I don't expect everyone to be able to read Satoshi's whitepaper and summarize it down to the tiny details. But you know we have \"normies\" panic selling and refusing to re-enter the market, all because they refuse to shut out the FUD. Meanwhile, the rest of us who got in well below $10k aren't worried. Just a bit annoyed.  \n\nTA isn't magic. It's not 100% accurate. It's all about probabilities. Those call groups that charge money use TA to more or less guarantee they'll turn a profit at least over 50% of the time. It's like mastering the probabilities inherent within poker to win at Vegas.

I don't really think that the government would trying to stop bitcoin because they can earn from it too. Only the incometax. But anyways, the government could definetly not ban miners, miners are nothing more than computers build for mining (sort of) and the government couldn't just ban that things. GPU Rigs are 95% computer parts. But the government could definetly do something about bitcoin transactions but the possibility that this would happen is pretty low. I work at a tax office in Austria and all my collegues and also our whole financial system (excluding the private banks) all think, that bitcoins are going to have a future here. And gladly our government and co are very open to this things. ",

I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily though as bitcoin could just replace the value of the dollar. So say that bitcoin replaced all currencies you would just be paid a value in bitcoin instead of the US dollar. It wouldn't affect peoples lives accept for those who bought in early",

Back when it crashed in September it stayed at $3,700 for two weeks straight going down to low $3,500 then up to $4,000 and all in between. Finally it climbed back up to $4,000 and never looked back after that. If this was going to 10k again it would have already. It\u2019s touched $16k twice. Some FUD last night killed the rally it was under, that\u2019ll die out in due time and it will regain traction. ",

I was tempted to sell too because of the huge volatility, but honestly I think this is just a good shakeout. It will continue up eventually. You have to shake out the weak hands at some point, it's just taking a little longer, So many indecisive people, especially since the end of the year is here. But I don't want to be one of those indecisive people, so I will hold. ",

Coinbase says they don't provide private keys due to their \"cold storage\" technology and likely related to their security policies. If most people are using BTC to invest and convert to fiat, why would anyone want to go through transferring BTC to a cold hardware wallet when the company says they already secure it for you on an enterprise scale? Wouldn't it be easier for an average user to convert to fiat or vice versa using an exchange rather than accessing it through cold hard wallet storage? ",

BTC did become \"main stream\" lately because it's all you hear about in the news.  I've been in BTC since 2013 (edit: then sold - then got back in later) and never have I heard a general conversation in public about it until the other day when I over heard 2 people talking about \"setting up an account on Coinbase\".  So when these people go in and buy coins at $18K+ and then lose that money inside of a day you better believe they will never touch BTC again.  Without them making all of the micro buys the whales will have only the old school BTC people and themselves.  The old school BTC'ers are all in the HODL camp and the whales know this.  So if there is little to no new blood coming into BTC then how do think that is going to affect the price of BTC?  Look at 99.99% of BTC trades.  They are micro trades that don't do a thing to the market.  Watch the video on the wall collapse during the run up to $20K.  There was a $13M dollar sell in that wall.  Better believe we are all being manipulated brother.  We can HODL all day long and the whales could care less.  We do not own the majority.  That's fact.",

Christmas just ended and many people went home after hours of discussing how to buy Bitcoin and now even Ripple over dinner. Friend of mine who's living abroad in a low energy cost area who was skeptical about Bitcoin for the longest time is now thinking about dropping cash on a mining operation. When monthly utility bills are pennies on the dollar compared to what we pay in the states, why not!  \n\nI can see January being tough for us though. Post-Xmas period is when people don't have cash and even advertisers draw down spending since no one can afford their products. We'll just have to be patient.",

No response from support, expensive transfer fees (people tried buying things with btc on their coinbase account and had to pay 20$ fee for a 3$ payment), no segwit implementation (is coming 2018 whilest all the other ones had it in a week after announcement), temporarely disabled transactions and much more. I think coinbase isn't a bad place for buying bitcoins or that they have a lack of security. For me, coinbase is more likely a bank. A bank that doesn't interact with their customers at all.\n\nEdit1: I forgot about the BCH fiasco with Coinbase. They are wanking because Bitcoin Cash is so super duper. Fun Fact: It isn't. If you are on this subreddit for at least 3 minutes, you can find so many posts why coinbase is fucked up.",

Afterwards the safest thing to do is to move your eth to a cold storage or at least myetherwallet.

Sometimes they all kinda follow each other, so when one is cheap, the other you need to exchange it with is also down, so they exchange rate ends up being the same when they're both up. It's tricky to find the best deal. \n\nAnd then you're also dealing with really long wait times and high fees with btc like you already know. \n\nGood luck with everything!
