Btc if you have noticed has performed excellent in times of a bear market for 8 months or so. I remember speaking about Btc in 2014 and what prices it will reach and how, same with Ltc from $3.50. I got called many names but look how far we have come ladies and gentlemen. Crypto is here to stay and those who listened to me become very RICH indeed. Dont listen to FUD be strong.  Hold and if anything keep buying. Personally i have been toping up for the last  2 months now. The next bull run we have you will see many many Noobs exiting the game because they bought december/jan at our highs and are feeling a little hard done by. My advise to the people is BUY more now prices are low instead of waiting to sell as soon as you see one spike lol . These people that sell on the first sign of a bull run will be holding there head in shame they will double miss the boat. HODL/BUY and by 2025 be your own status of Elite. well done to those who have achieved this already. Btc soon will be over 25k each and go for the 35-40k mark good luck Bitcoin world, if anyone has any question for Fitness feel free to ask I'm BACK",

Of course, the amount of coin that $1 purchases will be less when the price is $40K.\n\nHaving been involved with BTC since 2013, people were saying the exact same thing that you in regards to $1000, $5000. Certainly $20K was laughed at.\n\nI was telling my friend on the phone this afternoon, as we were discussing how we had a hard time comprehending that the price would ever get to $6000 a couple of years ago. Now for it to stay relatively stable there is impressive as a new floor has obviously been reached. I believe we will almost certainly see the price rice to $100K by 2020. We are following an exponential curve with great consistency. With more investors coming, it will happen. The question is when? Maybe by early 2019 even?",

You\u2019re like every mega preacher who tells his large denomination to donate every dollar from their measly paychecks and God will reward you with an immense return (like in that case, why are we investing in Bitcoin?

            "Text": "You do realize that purchasing fractions of a coin is an option?  We can invest $1 into BTC at any price.  Of course, the amount of coin that $1 purchases will be less when the price is $40K.  \n\nHaving been involved with BTC since 2013, people were saying the exact same thing that you in regards to $1000, $5000.  Certainly $20K was laughed at.  \n\nI was telling my friend on the phone this afternoon, as we were discussing how we had a hard time  comprehending that the price would ever get to $6000 a couple of years ago.  Now for it to stay relatively stable there is impressive as a new floor has obviously been reached.  I believe we will almost certainly see the price rice to $100K by 2020.  We are following an exponential curve with great consistency.  With more investors coming, it will happen.  The question is when?  Maybe by early 2019 even?",

In fact, the maturity of participants are actually quite tech savvy and smart.\n\nThe fact that it spiked to almost 20k is more reason than ever to expect more people to jump in. Sure, it drops after each spike but if you can liquidate in time..which you can now do WAY easier than ever before, you can make some hefty profits. Now, consider that after each drop the bottom rises.\n\nIf you honestly believe that speculation is the only thing that adds value to Bitcoin you should play around in traditional stocks. A great many established companies are extremely overvalued, by as much as 3 and 400%. Every dollar over what the company is considered to be \"worth\" based on earnings, projected earning etc.,  is a risk no less than a dollar in crypto.\n\nNow, open your mind to realize network value. Forget the concept of a stock, and consider the concept of a global ledger that stores a record of worth and transaction that is accurate beyond any other record keeper on the planet, maintained by math, encryption and high scale redundancy.\n..Removing human error with NO need to pay employees to maintain it!! \"No intrinsic value\" my ass. Wait until the next generation comes online, a generation raised to trust digital storage and encryption.",

That price spike isn't going to magically appear out of nowhere. It requires a gigantic spike of new individuals willing to purchase bitcoin for a price higher than it's ever gone, in the hopes that it won't screw them over like it did everyone who bought the last high. The last spike heavily influenced the social climate and perception, if that perception is negative you've got no buyers willing to buy the high, without them, you get no price spike.",
