            "Text": "I see Bitcoin as Digital Gold and a store of Value. There are a lot of folks that are associating price of Bitcoin to its usage, primarily spending in BTC. This will be an imp component ONLY when we start getting paid in BTC - or make money in BTC - then we can expect to spend in BTC. Why would 'anyone' buy BTC in USD to spend BTC - why would you buy something in digital Gold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the focus 'globally' should change to getting paid in BTC then the real usage/spending BTC will come into play. We should all play our part in that if we want to see BTC price to rise. Start getting paid in BTC - ask your employers etc. There are payroll systems already that would allow your employer to do that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTC as store of value is the most imp component. So I would never spend BTC but would do it to save on all transaction fee etc ONLY if were to start getting paid in BTC.",

            "Text": "Pretty interesting.  A couple of points:\n\n1) Bitcoin to the S&P is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  There are -- as you know -- a lot of differences between the instruments and markets.  A better comparison might be to commodities where the price is heavily influenced by derivatives/futures and where it's a purely supply/demand play. Stocks move on all kinds of news and metrics related companies' performance.  You might be better off comparing with metals.\n\n2) The Fed is *absolutely* propping up the stock market.  What are the implications?  Stocks could go \"up\" based on this free money, but is their *value* really going up?  What about the value of Bitcoin by comparison?  Is it likely to go up relative to fiat money that is being printed as though a bunch of sailors on three-day leave were in charge of the presses?\n\n3) Liquidity.  Traditional TA is hit or miss with Bitcoin because the liquidity is so low.  One whale buying $200 million or shorting $200 million can cause a massive candle and blow any analysis out of the water.\n\n3a) Take a look at the order books if you want to see where this is going.  It's about 7x as much money on the buy side as on the sell side.  I surmise that most of those buy orders in the $1000-2000 range have been placed by the guys that engineered the big dump back in November.  A LOT of Bitcoin was borrowed just prior to that dump (eg, 25,000 BTC from Genesis alone on November 12).  When will it be paid back?  That's when we bust out.\n\nTrying to trade this is not smart in general.  Just buy dips and wait for for Shorty to pay his bills.",

I\u2019ve used this entire period to accumulate where I know in my heart of hearts Bitcoin will be a 6 digit and then a 7 digit number sometime in my life.",
