But now that the hype is gone, it can only be a store of value if it is useful (that means if you can buy stuff with it without huge volatility). Conclusion: it has no value, apart from pointless speculation, but this will end as well if it doesn't prove to be useful. Price of 3200 is way, way too high. It can only go down from now on, unless there are clear signs of adoption, and that's not the case. Question is if it will ever be adopted at all. This is not the bottom. Another drop and more miners will sell. Some miners can only hold it for another 2-3 weeks before they must sell because of rising costs. You can ban this post (I see many bans lately), but maybe it's time for the mods to take wise decisions as well and face reality?",

Could be btc will reach 20k again in 10-15 years, if something strange happens, like hyperinflation, but do people really want to wait that long? You'll be old and ugly.

It had an exceptional run last year, way over the top kind of good, so this year had a way over the top kind of bad. Without balance there is nothing. I'm thinking we are at the bottom now and it will be slow upward growth from here. Take a look at the Nasdaq composite chart which represents thousands of tech companies and how hype played out in their early stages during the dot com bubble. Hype is hype ...it works very similar throughout all verticals - web, weed ,crypto etc. But after the hype there is real growth, and bitcoin being a currency hybrid asset, can experience multiple hype bubbles due to its nature and cross platform use.",

Meaning, 1 bitcoin could provide a down payment on a car today and outright buy a car in the future. It has nothing to do with conversion to fiat. Only reason to convert to fiat is to make purchases because merchants haven't fully adopted crypto as a method of payment. Investors are speculating on this happening in the future to some extent and are also speculating that the price will eventually stabilize (or become less volatile) as the user base increases, making it a legitimate store of value.\n\nIn other words, your post is stupid.",

            "Text": "I run my own mining farm and I can say it's pretty rough to be a miner right now. There have been a large number of miners shutting down and exiting the market, at least temporarily, because of the drop in price. You can see this in the most recent drop in mining difficulty. It was the second largest drop in difficulty in Bitcoins history. It was largely overdue as difficulty kept rising unsustainably even as the bear market continued to get worse. It is finally starting to come back down. Difficulty will adjust up or down as miners turn on or shut down which will always make it profitable for some people to mine. I imagine it will continue to drop even further with the next adjustment.\n\nThe cost to mine 1 bitcoin will vary between miners and has largely to do with their cost of electricity.  I think just guessing based on my rates if you're paying anything above maybe $0.07 per kWh it is probably no longer profitable to mine. At $0.06 per kWh I'm barely mining at a profit. You also have to figure in other costs like rent, internet, insurance, investors and other overhead a miner has to pay. It's going to be a rough next few months for us. I'm a little nervous about how long this bear market will last. All I can do at this point is hunker down, cut costs, and just keep mining what I can until it becomes no longer profitable to do so. Praying for a recovery in 2019.",

You think businesses can operate on btc when they risk losing even 2% of its value in one day? Even 0.5% loss is too much to be able to use a coin. It's simply useless as a payment method and that's hard to swallow for the majority of holders. Some of them seem to think that the more holders, the less volatility, but it has nothing to do with the amount of people who have this coin. The volatility is a consequence of fixed supply, which leads to speculation, until people realize that this constant speculation and holding makes this coin useless, and we may almost reach this point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that people are selling is because they don't see the value of it rising in the near future, otherwise they would hold. The hype is over and it didn't prove to have value after the hype (unlike .com businesses, who quickly recovered). ",

The adoption of Bitcoin is already on course and outside of total internet collapse, nothing can stop it. It's a very slow process though and many will doubt it because they are programmed to only see currency in one shape. In terms of the crypto market, there's a lot of psychological factors to consider. When everyone starts to see what's happening, then there will be no more opportunity to profit from the speculation, so for now I'm happy to buy at low prices :). It will be at least another generation before any real movement in adoption, so we may get a few more big run ups and strong corrections before the price starts to stabilize.",

            "Text": "Yes, definitely.  When volume dries up in a tight trading range, which is not making new-lows, it usually indicates that a bottom is in place.  But you need to see a real burst of volume, as the price accelerates out of the gate. This is your only assurance that all are jumping in behind you for the run upward.  \n\nAn upward price movement, that does not attract a large increase in volume, will just fall back on its ass.  We haven't seen this kind of positive price-to-up-volume increase with BTC in many months.  Heavy volume without a price increase indicates churning between buyers and sellers.  That usually means that a top has been reached.  \n\nWhether price has reached a short-term top, or a long-term top, has a lot to do with the angle of the upward spike.  The December 2017 price-graph was a blow-out top for BTC.  All upward energy was expended.  Its price-line represented a screaming sell signal.  By that time, I believe the price had gapped-up seven times in its final trajectory, over the course of only a few days.  After something like that, it's time to short.  But wait until after the next attempted rally fails to reach a new ATH.  \n\nBeyond that point, making money depends on getting on-and-off the ball (going long or short) as the price-line descends toward the bottom of what will eventually form as the next consolidation trough.  \n\nThen, rinse and repeat.",

Without fiat money, Jim would have to get the goats from Alice, slaughter one, give you half. Imagine a chain like this of a hundred people, you would starve before you get your goat meat. Instead the government says, your one unit of work is worth 100 dollars. Alice's goat, based on supply and demand, are worth 200 dollars. You can now go straight to Alice to get the meat and have it ready by dinner. Fiat money is essentially a standardised representation of your work and contribution to society, validated and guaranteed by the authorities of the society you are contributing to, to allow goods and services flow freely within the society without having to physically exchange hands.\n\n\nThe same concept applies to bitcoin - each bitcoin is a representation of the work done by miners, but with one difference - the work done by the miners do not benefit society at all, and in fact only takes up resources. It's only purpose is to validate the transaction of bitcoins, which is like circular logic - to get bitcoin you must do work, but the work you do only serves to send bitcoins - it's a enclosed environment that does not benefit people like Alice whatsoever, so she asks why are you telling me my goats are each worth two bitcoins. \n\nThis is the true reason why bitcoin is worthless - not because it's not backed by anything physical, but because it's is a representation of the work required for itself to exist, and nothing else. If instead, say, goats can be transferred via blockchain technology, and work is performed to validate this transfer (as opposed to relying on the government to guarantee), then goatcoin would have intrinsic value.",

The speculation is nice the first years, when there's hope and hype. But then we begin to see the clear picture, namely that nobody uses it. \n\nThe value of Bitcoin doesn't need to be based on something else's value. It needs to be useful as a payment method. When people are able to spend it without it losing value, and stores allow btc payments, we can call it useful. \n\nThe coin is doomed to fail, unless there's huge hyperinflation (won't happen in our lifetime, western economies are pretty solid, as we saw with the financial crisis; they quickly recovered), or if banks offer it to their clients as an investment method/part of their portfolio (won't happen so quickly). \n\nValue could go back to under 1000, not zero yet, because you'll always have gamblers and speculators. But the longer this bearmarket lasts, and no adoption happens, people will just abandon it.",

Without adoption BTC is just a curiosity.  I don\u2019t doubt we may see digital currency become a thing but I do doubt BTC will be it. I see zero signs of adoption growing, but I do see signs of decline.\n  \nHonestly a lot of the recent posting on this sub (you included) resembles nothing more than the discussion on forums related to the (revolutionary) EmDrive, or the (revolutionary fusion device) eCat. There\u2019s always a group of dogmatic core believers that hang on after the writing is on the wall. Sometimes they ultimately triumph...but not very often.\n  \nI hope I\u2019m wrong and you are insulting me from your Lamborghini next year.  But I see very little reason to think BTC is going to bounce back except for the fact that a few people have large amounts of money in it and would do anything to keep it from going to zero.  Then again, hedge-fund investors routinely see their investments go to zero, so maybe they\u2019re already writing it off.\n  \nHappy holidays! Keep your dream alive! ",

In contrast, in civil rehabilitation proceedings, non-monetary claims are not converted into monetary claims at the time of commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings.
