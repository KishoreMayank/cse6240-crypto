Bitcoin isn\u2019t money, it is currency.\n\nThis is important because whether a currency is a wooden stick with a notch in it or a silver coin or a digital asset doesn\u2019t matter, currency doesn\u2019t \u201coutperform\u201d fuck all. Money outperforms, because it is backed by a country and the relative power of that country.\n\nArguing that the \u201chardness\u201d of a currency is the defining property of how successful the currency is seems like you\u2019re missing the point.\n\nAs an example the USD is the globally dominant \u201cmoney\u201d, but it is a crappy currency: relatively easy to forge (paper, unlike other countries in the G8) and hugely expanded money supply (recent QE).",

It's not your home insurance's business to cover the risk this creates, they cover tangible objects that you own and store in your home/around it.\n\nA solution would be to have multiple backups of your seed in secured locations (offline), preferably geographically distant of each others. Having one or more additional seed words to secure them in this scenario and not store them together is a good idea too.\n\nI honestly don't think there will ever be insurances that will cover the value linked to private keys like this, it's too easy to generate keys and move around funds without ever giving out your identity, how would you prove that they were lost/destroyed/robbed?",

The reasons are as follows:\n\n- Bitcoin is exclusively leaderless, there is no sole entity deciding on bitcoin's fate beside the whole bitcoin economy and community by participating within the network's consensus rules.\n\n- Bitcoin has a tremendous network effect which cannot be successful competed against due to first mover advantage\n\n- Bitcoin has the highest amount of fullnodes running all around the world (about 60.000 at the time of writing) which renders bitcoin the most decentralized crypto (likely ever) in existence.\n\n- Meanwhile bitcoin's mining distribution has also increased to healthy levels whereas its hashrate is the highest within the crypto space\n\n- Bitcoin has a outstanding development team consisting of hundreds of very smart people all around the world\n\n- Bitcoin has the leading support within companies, politics and the community as a whole\n\n- Bitcoin's second layer solution lightning network which is built on the most secure blockchain in existing is able to process transactions blazing fast. Especially the aspect of having a totally secure first layer and a lightning fast second layer is the most genius step bitcoin could have taken.\n\nIn my view all this can hardly be beaten by any shitcoin (any other alt as well as all the results of forking/splitting the original chain).\n\nAll those shitcoins are just stupid pump and dump getting rich quick schemes which will finally die out when more use cases are built on top of bitcoin's blockchain. Surely it will still take some time but time is on bitcoin's side.\n\nThere are and will ever only be 21 million *valid* bitcoins in existence, so the fear of being inflated by various additional shitcoins is completely groundless.",
