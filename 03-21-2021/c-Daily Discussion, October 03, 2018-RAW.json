Basically, we all agreed that the most powerful companies on the planet would have crumbled under the negative media coverage thrown at Bitcoin over the years. I mean scandals, hacks, country wide bans, the whole lame 'no intrinsic value' claims, Warren Buffet's opinions, claims of criminal use, and the list goes on. Yet, here is Bitcoin continuously growing insanely larger in both price and infrastructure over the past years. As a network, it continues to grow and expand, like the root system of a tree, the roads of a growing city etc. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!! ha ha.",

Now, I know there are several variables to consider but for the sake of comparison to Bitcoin I think it's a very valid point. This is because of the whole \"intrinsic value\" debate. Once a stock is overvalued to that extent it's all speculation and the intrinsic value is no more certain than the crypto space at all. Now the intrinsic value of bitcoin is another debate for another day, that I'm quite tired of to be honest.",

            "Text": "Well I think that most of us involved with crypto take it for granted just how much more comfortable we are with the tecnical requirement for entry, than the average joe who uses their bank's stock platform app to invest in traditional stocks.\n\nThat's one of the reasons that an onramp such as bakkt will open up the space to a vastly larger audience. We value the concept of maintaining control over our private keys, sure, but the majority of people still barely grasp the concept of blockchain and bitcoin. They want to add bitcoin to their hedge or high risk portion of investment but are not interested in cold storage or any of that side of things. \n\nSo bakkt in my opinion helps to bring new money in bitcoin and since it's barely been only 10 years, the potential of where this is going and how it may be shaped is limited only by our imaginations.",

Many stocks are way overshot on P/E and once you get to that point you are at as much speculation and risk as crypto. The stock market is uncharacteristically overvalued this past year or so IMO. I hope I'm wrong but the next crash could make 2008 look pale in comparison. ",

I also used the phrase 'uncharacteristically overvalued'. Specific stocks I can lose the \"in my opinion\" but when speculating on speculation? Yeah, I can most definitely be subjective. Curious though; With all due respect, with of all the semantic disasters, poor grammar and talk of 'lambos' and 'moon' on this thread, what in the world would drive you to pick my use of 'in my opinion' to critique? lol.",

            "Text": "It would certainly create a large amount of on-chain channel-closing transactions, which would increase demand for block space and so increase the fees people pay. However, this would only block/hinder new channels opening if the fees increased enough to crowd out people who wanted to create a new channels, and did so for a sustained amount of time (days/weeks). This is unlikely as the increased fees will reduce demand from those who don't need to make payments desperately as well as encourage miners that want to earn the higher fees to spin up extra hardware as mining is now more profitable, balancing out the supply and demand and allowing the mempool to clear down again. \n\nFinally, all of this relies on the assumption that we even enter the scenario where a single large central hub with thousands of channels arises in the first place - in reality a lot of node software will randomly choose a (fairly well connected) node to create a channel with if the user doesn't manually choose one, in order to avoid a situation like this.",
