I look at this over a 10 yr time frame and overall fundamentals and feel ok with a buy and hold approach. I have gotten more with dips this year and average now around 7k. I feel comfortable with the downside to upside risk/benefit ratio here as a long. I fear my guessing (aka technical trading) skills would probably lead to more selling but I doubt that I would be on board for the big logarithmic gains then... and that\u2019s all that really matters.

If you can\u2019t see that by now, you don\u2019t understand the cryto market. Even if stop loss orders had a role, they would still need some market mover to tigger them. They\u2019re all not going to be filled unless there are large market movers manipulating the market in one direction. And the usual panic is a natural product of daytraders and weak HODLers but it doesn\u2019t remotely have a significant effect. What does are the whales with wallets that each 1000+ BTCs thus representing 40% of the BTC market. You see the manipulation larger in altcoins like ETH and BCH because the whales are greater stakeholders with altcoins. Bitcoin is actually far less manipulative and stable than altcoins. That\u2019s why any responsible investor should stick to buying Bitcoin.",

Everything took a big hit from the BTC drop yesterday, so most coins are fairly low in comparison to what they were just 48 hours ago. Bitcoin will probably offer lower, more stable returns (relatively speaking), but even at the price it is now, to just double your profits, Bitcoin would have to jump to $12,000 - and if you're doing the right thing by only putting as much money into crypto as you can afford to lose, chances are you won't make an insane amount of profits quickly unless you can afford to put in large sums of money. But altcoins are hit and miss (usually miss in the grand scheme of things), so it's a gamble.",

Let's take Bitcoin as the first example, starting from the top, respectively it would be: PoW > Public > Blockchain > SHA-256 > Currency > Currency > Blockchain-Native\n\nWhereas something like Etherium would be: PoW > Public > Blockchain > Ethash > Utility? > dApp Platform > Blockchain-Native\n\nNow let's do some other coins, just to make your homework easier ;)\n\nStellar: BFT (SCP) > Federated > Blockchain > ? > Utility/Currency > Currency/Payment Platform > Blockchain-Native\n\nSiacoin: PoW > Public > Blockchain > BLAKE(2b) > Utility > Data Storage > Blockchain-Native\n\nDigix: Proof-of-Asset/Provenance > Public > Blockchain > IPFS (Multihash) > Security (Asset-backed for DGX, Share-like for DGD) > Asset Management > Blockchain-Native\n\nNano: DPoS+PoW* > Public > DAG (block-lattice) > BLAKE2 > Currency > Currency > Blockchain-Native\n\nIOTA: PoW* > Public > DAG (Tangle) > Curl > Utility > IoT > Blockchain-Native\n\nAsterix (*) denotes that the PoW is not important or a trivial implementation.\n\n---\n\nI was in a rush so apologies for the poor formatting and if there are any errors. However it shows that coins can be separated and categorised into many different groups. For your presentation, it may be better to use #6 - Use Case/Purpose as the definition to separate \"types\" of coins because it's simple for everyone to understand without much technical knowledge and it shows just how vast the ecosystem is. It may also be important to touch on categories #1 and #2 since they are also important.",

            "Text": "So if you need to get bitcoin to buy goods then it is a demand but if you need it to make profit then it isnt. I dont see your logic. When ever I need bitcoin for anything, I have demand for it. mining cost is what im willing to pay for it, profit is what im wiling to exchange it for. Same as buying and exchanging for goods.",

            "Text": "Assuming your logic is correct. Let's look at it from another example. Old Granny in her retirement from corporate ladder decided to invest in an apple farm. She rented a huge piece of land, bought some tractors and farming equipments to start growing her apple farm. Those were her initial cost. She also needs to pay  ongoing wages to her workers and daily expenses to run her business. Soon 'Granny Smith' apples were famous and people's love of  apples meant they were sold for $20000 a ton to retailers. However one day people no longer love apples and instead like oranges. Price of her prized apples plummeted to $6500 a ton and she is now breaking even in cost/profit. She turned to Reddit for a solution to her problem. She came across someone saying that in bitcoin, if U increase the hashrate you increase the demand. A light bulb moment illuminated on granny's head and turned her white hair temporarily yellow. She will do the same with her apples. She hires more workers and rent more land. Has demand created. Only in granny's mind maybe, but at the farm market next month, the only thing that has changed is that Granny has more apples to sell. ",
