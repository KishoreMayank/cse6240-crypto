However if we ever want to see a bitcoin ETF and someday bitcoin in retirement plans (401k), then the winklevoss twins seem to have the right strategy. These types of investment vehicles require strict rules be followed.  Bitcoin in 401k plans would be a huge boon to the price. \n\n",

This is known as an asymptotic function, and the number it approaches is just under 21 million.\n\nLost coins have no bearing on this process, so effectively there would be quite a bit less than 21M BTC available in the long run.",

When there is no tangible reward from minting new bitcoin miners will still mine for the fees.\n\nThe lost coins impact supply, making the practical available supply much smaller than 17,468,850.

But I strongly recommend using limit orders on Coinbase Pro to purchase BTC without a fee, and without a markup in price.  If you have Coinbase account, you already have a Coinbase Pro account.  I just learned how to do this yesterday and can help if you want.",

That cash is available immediately.  The go into Coinbase Pro and on the left hand side, click Deposit, then choose USD, then Coinbase Wallet to transfer your cash from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro.\nThen you are ready to buy.  Choose Limit instead of Market to get a fee free purchase.  If you want to use all of your money you transferred over, click Max under Amount.  Choose a limit price (usually something just under the current trading price).  When/if BTC hits that price, your purchase automatically takes place.  You can always cancel your order and place a new one.\nThen if you want, you can transfer your BTC back to Coinbase since it has a slick interface.  Veterans recommend to get all of your money off of Coinbase an into your own wallet.  I'm not there yet since I don't have much skin in the game.",
