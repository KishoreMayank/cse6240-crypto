            "Text": "So as I understand how the lightning network works, in order for a program to accept or send payments for you it needs to have the private keys to particular lightning transactions on-hand so that they can be exchanged when you make a new lightning transaction and to sign in the case of the other party breaking the rules, which seems like a little bit of a security risk (Best practice, of course, is to not keep plain-text private keys to active addresses on any online computer). Authorizing the necessary signs and broadcasts by hand on an air-gapped, clean install computer would be a bit of a pain as compared with letting a program do it on a connected computer, especially for a merchant taking a lot of orders through their channel(s), or an exchange...\n\nOf course it will *probably* never be *fully* safe doing it entirely automatically (anything can be hacked, and of course recently we're seen the Spectre and Meltdown issues...), so are there any plans to implement a hardware wallet designed with the lightning network in mind (or a lightning wallet that allows offline signing by generating the private key on an existing hardware wallet design) where you could, for example, just press the button to authorize for the key exchange part of the protocol or whatever at every transaction?",

Literally 6 weeks ago I remember getting a 1080 on Black Friday for 489. I'm not even really sure what to make of this as I've only seen a computer item do this one other time in my life and I was a little kid.

Wait until lightning is ready?

I know segwit effectively increases the block size, and am a big fan of segwit, I just want to try to understand how we'll figure out, as a community, when and what size of blocksize increase we'll need. \n\nSo, some metrics that immediately came to mind were things like average amount of RAM of a computer for a given price point, maybe average cost of consumer bandwidth. How should we judge when it's time for a block size increase of a given amount. If it's possible to introduce some kind of sharding to the blockchain to reduce the storage required per node, or maybe if there are optimisations that can be made to processing time for blocks by nodes, would this make it easier to increase the block size limit, as the cost and impact on node operators might be lessened?\n\nAlso, given the sort of amplification effect of segwit, should we be considering block size increases on the order of hundreds of KiB, say for example a blocksize limit increase to 1.2-1.4MiB or something like that?",

Do you guys realize how many problems does Bitcoin have, and the fact that it depends exclusively on us, the community, to fix them?\n\nWhat are we doing to fix them? What are we doing to stop the ever increasing fees? Apparently price discussion will solve this, right?\n\nNo...\n\nWho gives a fuck about the current price? Bitcoin will always be volatile, at least for the years to come, are you x$ down on your investment? Don't give fucks and you'll see how everything works out, because it turns out you're not investing on a magic coin that changes it's price whenever it feels like... No no... You invested your hard earned money into a technology that is, as of today, is changing the world. You are just looking at the small picture, because you put your money into something without actually knowing what it was, but hey, they say ignorance is bliss, and it sure might be.\n\nPeople of /r/Bitcoin you have two options. You can panic sell and save us the trouble of having to constantly debate prices with you, that way in a few years when crypto rules the fucking world there will be like discovery channel specials to teach you how badly you messed up when you sold at 13k because \"Bitcoin crashed\" knowing that a few months ago one Bitcoin was 5k. OR... You could start making some research, and start FUCKING HELPING, either coding, spreading awareness, talking to your local community, opening spaces for Bitcoin and other cryptos, because you guys HAVE to understand... Bitcoin is fucking freedom to chose what to do with your own money, this is what we are fighting for, not the right to be rich in 2 months...\n\nGeez...\n\n",

So long as you use the watchtower system, or come online before the locktime ends, your fine. This is all talking as an end user of course.\n\nThe challenge is operating a node or hub which routes LN payments. These are inherently more high risk, for the reason you say, the keys must be in memory, and if someone can hack the computer that the node lives on, and dump its memory, they have the keys. I don't know of any good direct technical solution. The best thing to do is to employ good security practices, lock down the server on which you run a routing LN node as much as you can, and only keep a minimum amount of funds loaded into channels that you're willing to commit and risk, vs how much you get in fees.\n\n\n",

Or buy broad market ETFs and dollar cost average for that boring but effective money printer. \n\nCrypto is basically gambling. Nobody really knows where bitcoin is going. If you put 7k into bitcoin, you might end up with 10k or 2k in a month. Last few times bitcoin has corrected over 80% down from its local high. You are playing in a market that's unregulated and full of potential pump and dump schemes. You also need to consider the time necessary to make deposits and get coins transferred (and fees).\n\nIf you want to be a property investor, I'd recommend putting 80% into a long term stock account, and 20% into crypto. Putting 100% into bitcoin at these prices is a ton of risk. The fact that you are asking if you should do it shows me that you are probably not ready for that much risk.",

So you can try again (with a higher fee maybe) or just give up and wait for a time of lower demand.\n\nLN won't help you in your situation BTW, in case you were thinking of waiting.",

There are simple things like wedges, bull flags, double tops & bottoms and there are more complex ways like Elliott waves.

One of two things is going to happen. They will exhaust their supply and the return higher will continue. They will exhaust some of their supply and the price will start to fall. If they are still holding a lot of coin and they chase the downfall they are just going to drive it lower. Looking at the Bitcoin chart from a technical analysis perspective it's beyond overbought. That also means absolutely nothing with Bitcoin. I don't think there is any rational way to even remotely predict where the price will go. You literally just have to make your own choices",

            "Text": "I think CoinBase is a good option for you to start.  Open up a CoinBase account and link your bank account.  But DO NOT deposit directly into CoinBase through their main website!!!\n\nGo to www.GDAX.com and make your direct deposit from your linked bank account on there.  GDAX is a website that's also owned by CoinBase (same company) but they don't charge you at all for an ACH bank account deposit into your account like CoinBase.com will.  Downside is that you can't deposit on GDAX with a credit card... convenience has it's costs and CoinBase is the only way to deposit with a CC for an instant transfer.\n\nI've already recommended the above to friends and family and it saved them $20-$30 in fees they were going to blindly pay.  Why do that???\n\nGood luck!!! It's a wild ride! HODL",

            "Text": "A Buy wall is when somebody puts in a large order at a certain price and the sell wall is the opposite. So today I am seeing a stairstep Sell wall pattern. It is odd. Every $10 price point there is 100 Coins for sell. ([around the $15,150 range](https://www.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD))\n\nThis doesn't help predict the price movements tho. It takes a good bit of buying pressure to break walls like that but it has happened before. And Sell Walls tend to prop the price up a bit but again, I've seen them eaten in a heartbeat. The other thing is, most of these walls are managed by bots, so when the price works its way up to a sell wall, there is a good chance the bot cancels the order and moves it to a higher price. Same goes for a Buy wall. We all want to buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest.",

            "Text": "I understand everything you've said, and I am very pro-decentralisation. I'm talking about how the decision can be measured and made. Even with full segwit adopt, and widespread LN usage, there will come a point maybe months, maybe years, maybe decades from now, where we get back to a situation like we're in now, where the demand for transactions is greater than what can be added to the blockchain. And I'd like to get a discussion going about how we evaluate such a situation. \n\nLook at my comment history, you'll see I'm very pro-LN, I go out of my way to explain it whenever someone misunderstands or misrepresents it. \n\n>Raising the block size requires consent from the entire community including people who value decentralization above all else, so you won't get anywhere unless you have an honest dialog with us.\n\nI know this, I never suggested otherwise, I'm trying to get a discussion started about what it would take for that consensus to shift to a point where larger blocks were needed, and how the necessary block size increase would be determined. And I resent the suggestion I am not being honest. \n\n>Try to understand the concerns of the pro-decentralization side. Read this under the section \"Scaling on-chain will destroy bitcoin's decentralization\"\n\nAs I said, I'm pro-decentralization, but to suggest that on-chain scaling can never be appropriate doesn't make sense if you believe that bitcoin can ever reach widespread global adoption. Segwit already increases the maximum possible block size, and the community, at least now, is pretty widely supportive of it. \n\nIf you could look to 10 years in the future, maybe more, it's not unreasonable to expect that computing power, bandwidth or memory will be more greater, or cheaper (same thing really), and so more people would be able to run nodes, or the same people would be able to run a more resource intensive node. It's also realistic to expect that advances will have been made to mitigate the resource intensiveness of running a node, ways to reduce how much data needs to be stored to record the blockchain, for example.",

So I\u2019m asking what app/wallet do you recommend for tumbling LTC out of Coinbase/gdax?  Thank you friend.",

            "Text": "One reason we say to wait for LN to become mature is that people may invent other technologies by then too. For example Payment Channel Factories were invented recently which also improves scalability, yet they were not part of the discussion in 2015 because they didn't exist yet. This is one reason it may not be productive to debate block sizes in 10 years when nobody knows what the landscape will look like then. Bitcoin itself isn't even 10 years old.\n\n> Even with full segwit adopt, and widespread LN usage, there will come a point maybe months, maybe years, maybe decades from now, where we get back to a situation like we're in now, where the demand for transactions is greater than what can be added to the blockchain. And I'd like to get a discussion going about how we evaluate such a situation. \n\nIt's a serious misconception that high demand is bad for bitcoin. In reality bitcoin *requires* that demand for block space is higher than supply. For three reasons 1) To avoid fee sniping 2) To provide miners with an income as inflation drops 3) To add a cost to non-monetary uses of the blockchain.\n\nHere are some links on this matter (they are all on that reading list I posted)\n\n* https://medium.com/@bergealex4/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-size-size-limit-70db07070a54\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/\n\n* https://scalingbitcoin.org/transcript/montreal2015/security-of-diminishing-block-subsidy\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6b57ca/full_blocks_good_or_bad/dhjxwbz/\n\nYou asked about sharding, have a look at petertodd's writeup about it: https://petertodd.org/2015/why-scaling-bitcoin-with-sharding-is-very-hard\n\nI'm still not convinced that there's any urgency in increasing on-chain capacity. What exactly is the problem today? High fees? Good, that means the miners have a sustainable source of income, it means fee sniping is less likely and that people will use precious block space more carefully. Saying high fees are a disaster is like saying *\"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded\"*.\n\nI think the *real* urgency is miner centralization. Right now competitive mining requires membership of a centralized relay network. Mining pools routinely use spy mining. I would actually support a *reduction* in on-chain capacity by increasing the block interval to be longer than 10 minutes, which would mean a latency becomes less important.\n\nSatoshi's great innovation was mining. This decentralized solution to the double spending problem. Today it's not working very well at all, and yet people are considering making it *even worse* just so they can copy the features of paypal and VISA? It seems insane to me, totally wrong priorities.",

            "Text": "I think that if you're interested in making base-level protocol changes to increase transaction throughput, a soft-fork blocksize limit increase is probably the most viable option at this point.\n\nMany of the developers/stewards have expressed (well-supported) beliefs that hard-forks represent an unconscionable moral sleight, by virtue of representing an imposition on other stakeholders in contexts where obvious widespread consensus does not exist. Soft-forks sidestep this aspect of things (and though there can be \"evil\" soft forks, it's certainly possible to err on the side of \"good\"ness).\n\nBut beyond just choosing the soft-fork approach, there's another problem left to tackle for anyone interested in a proposal of this nature, which not many take the time to consider: *should* we want fees to be lower? I personally would answer in the affirmative, but I certainly don't have end-all-be-all ultra-persuasive arguments to support my belief on the matter. \"High\" fees are good in many ways (as are low validation costs), and many don't bother acknowledging this side of things, which is a shame and tends to render their suggestions much more ignorable than they might otherwise be.",

Advocating raising the block size is moving towards that model, where some decentralization is lost in return for more transactions.\n\n> I'm not sure I understand what you're saying with regards to double spending and it not working very well? \n\nRight now maybe 2 or 3 individuals have control over 51% of hash power and therefore can reverse any bitcoin transaction they want, no matter how many confirmations it has. The fact that they *choose not to do this* is irrelevant. It's not talked about much here because everyone is so bullish but this is actually a disaster. It's a big reason why me and many others oppose any movement to making the problem even worse.",

I'm not advocating it, I'm asking by what metrics do we judge the appropriate block size for a given level of adoption. If many decades from now, there are billions of bitcoin users, and computer hardware and bandwidth cost a fraction of what they do today, how do we figure out what is an appropriate block size?\n\nIf we look at segwit, assuming wide adoption, 90%+, it will result in blocks that are ~2MB in size, there seems now a general support for segwit amongst the community, and so is it not fair to ask, how was that consensus achieved, in the context of current computer and bandwidth costs? The community has said, \"~2MB blocks are fine\", so, feet to the fire, why? By what metrics did the community judge this new larger block size to be acceptable?",
