Someone in country 1 has to buy a bitcoin then send it to a another wallet and then other person in other country sells the bitcoin.  If value that is transferred is big, it will look like price is pumped and later dumped. What i'm saying is that what looks like price manipulation might actually be bitcoin doing some work in real world.",

If it was based on the volume that was sent over the network, then something as simple as an exchange's hot wallet changing to a new address would trigger massive price increases all the time.

The huge inefficiency mean you would choose another method.\n\n If the large flows are from lots of people making little transfers, then you would expect the buying and selling to cancel out, unless, by an incredible chance, all the different, unconnected, senders bought at the same time, to push the price up, and all the receivers sold at the same time, pushing the price down, *with no overlap* in when the mass buying and the mass selling happened.",
