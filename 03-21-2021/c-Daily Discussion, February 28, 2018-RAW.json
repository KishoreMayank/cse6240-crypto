Neither of those things are a pump or a dump or anything else interesting. \n\nWe\u2019ve gone from 20k to a true dump down to 6k and we\u2019ve steadily been climbing back up. That\u2019s not a pump. Dropping a few hundred dollars before rebounding is not a dump. \n\nJust here to remind everyone to stay calm, hodl, and not listen to any of the retardation on this daily thread. Every single day it\u2019s different people making the same dramatic pronouncements that THEY FIGURED IT OUT. They didn\u2019t. No one has. No one knows what will happen. It may dump today. I don\u2019t know. But I know that no one can predict it. ",

If you save for a year, you can avoid the interest, but it for less, and own it outright 3 - avoid debt whenever you can, and when you must use it, only use it on investments that will increase or retain their value. School loans suck, but eventually they should increase your earning potential, mortgages should get you rent savings and an appreciating asset, buying a dress with a credit card is stupid 4 - spend less than you earn. If you don't earn enough, adjust your lifestyle while you find a better job. You're allowed to suffer 5 - suffering intentionally for a better life in the future is not suffering, it's investing time, congratulate yourself 6 - dropping a 20% credit card with a balance of $1000 is the same to your bottom line, mathematically, as a guaranteed 20% $1000 bond that pays $200 per year 7 - perfect is the enemy of the good, now is the shackles of poverty. If you can delay, delay. Money buys more tomorrow than today, savings empower and encourage, manufactured goods go on clearance every year\n> \n> Satisfaction should be your definition of success, not \"more.\"\n",

A violation there would expose the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and the trendline resistance seen today around $11,675 and $11,825, respectively.\n\n-A close today below the downward sloping 50-day MA of $10,512 would allow a re-test of the Feb. 25 low of $9,280.\n\n-Meanwhile, a break below $9,280.4 would signal the corrective rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $6,000 has ended and would open up downside towards the $6,000 mark.\n",

I think that as a rule of thumb we shouldn't even fear dumps at all, after all it's just profit taking. Probably what we should be *very* afraid of is the *slow and steady* decrease in price day by day because it would potentially mean a clear sign of market distrust. Thoughts?",

Trading positions are small now, i add more into it everytime we break a resistance level, but i need to see multiple candles close above the resistance for me to do that. I have pretty much only been swing trading BTC since i think 3rd week of Jan. That made me missed out on the massive alt rally on the 6th. But i have been gaining steadily. So it's working out good for me so far. I guess another reason it's working out better for me compare to others is that i do this full time and i gotta take profit out when i see them instead riding it long in the bear market. ",

            "Text": "I bet that about 90% of investors _also_ invest in Bitcoin. After all, if you have investment money, chances are you are investing in lots of diverse stocks and alt-coins.\n\nI recently watched the Bitcoin movie on Netflix. It's just like a casino, the house always wins. IN this case, it's the banks. Big Banks _always_ win because they have bigger power. So, they threw one of the bitcoin guys in jail, and set up all sorts of regulations over the purchase of Bitcoin. \n\nYou can't buy bitcoin anywhere in the USA without some kind of bank verification. I suppose that someone somewhere allows you to set up a digital wallet and give someone cash to get around the FBI and the $10k Cash max issue. \n\nBitcoin was about trying to have freedom, but this means you can funnel money to terror organizations, and buy drugs, and give money to Wikileaks. Governments CAN'T have this anywhere on the planet because it takes control away from Governments. Certainly the US, Japan, China, and the EU would never have anything that takes away their power without a fight. That's what the movie proved, that you can never take power from the Government, 'the house always wins'.",

            "Text": "Unless prices also go up in the right proportions and one keeps selling at the right times, it is possible to keep purchasing while it's going down and end up with a large number of coins at a very low average but still be out of pocket.    For example, say a person 1 BTC and 17K and another at 13K on the way done.   That's an average of 15K.  His average is down, but the fact remains that *he still spent 30K*, and the only way he can later break even or get ahead is to sell both 30K or higher.   That is, regardless of whether he buys when it's going down or when it's going down, he needs to sell at higher than what he actually spent.\n\n\nRemember that bitcoin is barely used for goods and services (and when it is, the calculation of cost is relative to real money) and its real use is hodl in the hope of profiting from new entrants.     \n\n\nThat is what matters is not just the average that one spent on buying a given number of bitcoins, it is what those bitcoins are worth in real money.  Just saying I have X bitcoins, and they cost Y is meaningless.",

First, crypto cannot offer many things that real money (through, say, credit cards) offer.   E.g., if you get scammed on a crypto purchase, to whom do you turn for redress?   Perhaps sa small thing to bitcoin zealots, but to most people such things matter more than decentralized and anonymous,  and fighting governments and banks, total freedom, etc.   In fact, the reality is that while people will always  have complaints against governments and banks and want total freedom, the reality is that in civilized countries rely on governments and banks, don't care to fight them, and are willing to give up some freedoms in order to have a civilized society.   Just look at how people who have been scammed in cryptos run to government institutions and scream *\"Do something!  You should have done something!\"*\n\nSecond, there will be major changes coming to the world of crypto, but they won't be of the the type that the true believers imagine.   For some time governments and institutions charged with maintaining financial law-and-order have been cryptos an easy pass, on the assumption that it was just a bunch of geeks fooling around with their toy play-money.    That is no longer possible, nor is it appropriate: we now have a wild wasteland of perverted greed, unregulated gambling, huge scams, and assorted criminality.   There has to be some crackdown (however mild) and an imposition of some order.\n\n\nWhat crypto zealots need to do is take a break from their computers and take a look at the world around them.   That will reduce the harshness of the inevitable adjustment to reality.",

            "Text": "> For those who bought at $17k these past few weeks should've been a great opportunity\n\nThis simply makes no sense.  Yes you can but more coins cheaper and thus end up with a lower average price.   But you are still out of the initial $17K plus whatever you spent on the new coins, and the only way to break even and get ahead is to sell at a price that gets back the $17K plus the new expenditure.   A lower average price does not mean you are out less money.\n\n\nHere is an even simpler view: People who bought at $17K did so in the believe that the price would keep going up, up, up.   I doubt that any see falling prices as a great opportunity.   \n\nFalling prices are great if you have already sold at a profit and are looking to replenish your stock, with the hope that it will again go up and you can sell at a higher price or if you shorted and are looking to fulfill the obligations or if this is an initial entry and are looking to profit later.  Otherwise falling prices are simply bad, which is why many here think the sky is falling in whenever they see a dip.",

Nickel Buyers are all the 'Ellen' watchers, all the waiters & waitresses and all the \"buy cuz it is cool to talk about at work\" guys. Micro-ish transactions are what is most likely driving it up or down.",

If BTC is causing chaos and grief amongst traditional investors in a little over 10yrs- good. The infrastructure hasn\u2019t caught up with the technology- but it will. But, I don\u2019t need to sit here and argue my point vs. your point as I can easily. It doesn\u2019t matter I am not going to change your opinion and you won\u2019t change mine. But I can tell you this. If you hold gold or bitcoin you can exchange it for fiat. It has value. I can\u2019t melt bitcoin down and make a  high end motherboard for mining but I sure can run bitcoin right through one.\n",

But crypto has what gold doesn\u2019t and that is a chance to become a form of everyday transaction as well as a store of value. Unless we go back to the gold standard but that went out the window when fiat was implemented. We don\u2019t use lady liberty silver dollars for everyday transactions now do we? A dime has less a value every time a dollar is printed off. Cupronickel is a dime and not 90%cu anymore. But they sure did fool us because it still looks like SILVER.",
