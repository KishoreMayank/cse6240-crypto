As for Bitcoin\u2019s price, it has no impact. People won\u2019t look at a price a year ago and be like...it\u2019s now lower than it was a year ago, time to sell. I just it\u2019s FUD or FOMO...tied entirely to emotions and Bitcoin value. If somebody told me Donald Trump would be President in 2013, I would disregard them...just being honest. Of course in a country where rural rednecks in flyover states ended up deciding the election, Trump can be president. And in a very progressive country like Canada, marijuana can be legalized. However, if somebody told me that 5 yrs ago, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. The current state can really blind your outlook in both positive and negative directions. Well said, Cryptogrip.",

There is positive news though: btc can't fall below 5800 in the next couple of weeks. The line has flattened. Level of interest is 8 out of 100 (lowest point in 1.5 years). As price follows interest, it's almost mathematically impossible to drop from level 8 to let's say 5 in 3 weeks. You can safely invest in Btc without losing much money the coming 3 weeks. 'But but you cannot prediction the future, you idiot'. Yeah, just like i couldn't predict the fact btc couldn't fall below 5800 3 weeks ago and everyone was yelling that btc would drop to 5000 (which is mathematically impossible to happen so quickly when we deal with a flat interest line after a crash in january).",

            "Text": "I actually agree with most of what cryptogrip said. It is irrelevant but only relevant for people who are obsessed with trends and data correlations. As for Bitcoin\u2019s price, it has no impact. People won\u2019t look at a price a year ago and be like...it\u2019s now lower than it was a year ago, time to sell. I just it\u2019s FUD or FOMO...tied entirely to emotions and Bitcoin value. If somebody told me Donald Trump would be President in 2013, I would disregard them...just being honest. Of course in a country where rural rednecks in flyover states ended up deciding the election, Trump can be president. And in a very progressive country like Canada, marijuana can be legalized. However, if somebody told me that 5 yrs ago, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. The current state can really blind your outlook in both positive and negative directions. Well said, Cryptogrip.",

It drops. Because after all the anticipation no one is getting rich quick and they jump ship.\n\nWhy do you think it is impossible? Because we don\u2019t know what the demand might be? No, but lots of people are guessing. They are making decisions based on those guesses. That means it is priced in!

I've invested in stocks long before crypto, and it seems to me that you are not acknowledging the difference between the two.\nFurthermore, if these things actually take off, and this hits the public ...not the coin owner public, but general public who never heard of bakkt, the sentiment will shift. I know you say I'm ignorant but I've been invested in BTC for many years and am not offended at all...because I am very confident that I am not ignorant so it would take much more than petty insults from you to offend me :).

I didn't think there were still people out there that made the \"no intrinsic value\" claim.\n\nAnyway good luck with being always right.
