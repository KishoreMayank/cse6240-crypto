Its okay people because the king of being wrong, Tom Lee still predicts Bitcoin will hit $25,000 by year\u2019s end. It\u2019s idiots like these that make the shorters and Bitcoin pessimists look good. There\u2019s not wrong with being optimistic as long as it\u2019s pragmatic.",

If those are the two topics under the spotlight, Vitalik can talk circles around Roubini because all Roubini does on this front is regurgitate the same old outdated claims, which he clearly does not understand.\n\nBasically, the whole thing is stupid. Roubini is stepping into water that he does not know how to navigate. He's been wrong about crypto every year and now that this year is bear market, he all of a sudden has credibility to talk blockchain, scaling, POW v POS etc?? It's ridiculous. ",

            "Text": "point 2 happened, point 3, 4,5 didn't need to happen cause it was another phase of crypto, point 6 didn't happen, but if it happened, no bullrun could have occured. The past bullruns are not the same. There will never be mass euphoria of the mass about crypto again. That only happens once. Average joe got in in december, got out in january, and will never come back investing into crypto without gradual adoption, something you didn't need before 2018. Without adoption now, average joe won't come back. One thing is for sure: you need average joe or his money through institutions. You didn't need average joe at the 2013 ath. ",

They hang on to positive news while it doesn't matter when there's no new interest/new investors. No new investors = going sideways or dropping. That is what's happening and that's what will happen for the coming weeks/months. I've been saying this since february and got the same responses as yours. Bitcoin investors have simply no clue of how the market works. They think universal market principles don't apply to crypto, they live in a parallel universele like Kanye West.",

This can only be average joe and not the crypto fanboy. \n\nAdoption as a payment method can only occur if btc loses its speculation value. It cannot be a speculative asset as well as a payment method. Would you want to buy a cup of coffee if the price could go up from 2 to 4 dollars in 20 seconds? It's either one or the other. If it becomes an adopted payment method, that means it would have lost its volatility and won't be interesting to make big profits. If it's still a speculative asset, it cannot become a payment method, thus it would be very difficult to be adopted by the mass (the mass doesn't like speculation - only a small part invests in stocks and gold). It means the price of 20.000 is extremely high and attaining that price again would be fantastic but very difficult, cause average joe doesn't come back so quickly to speculate a second time and get his ass burned again. We have seen it with .com companies. It took Microsoft 16 years to come back at ath. Same goes for other .com companies. The only difference is that Microsoft and Google already had VALUE. Google had a great search engine which displayed great utility. Microsoft had hotmail and other great products, which were used. Bitcoin? The question remains: what is the real value of it? Even after the .com bubble, Google had value, but we can't say the same about bitcoin and crypto. The only thing that has true value now, and even the biggest enemies of crypto acknowledge this (Roubini), is blochchain. But there's a difference between blockchain and crypto. It could well be that all crypto fails but blochcain survives. Remains institutions: institutions will never ever invest in crypto if high volatility remains. No big institution in the world is going to gamble with people's money (retirement funds, big banks). Way too risky and they're not interested in short term gains but long gradual gains. The stockmarket is ideal for them and poses way less risks. They have no incentive to enter crypto. If they'll enter, volatility would be very low and the time of big gains would be over. You have to think logical instead of being a fanboy. ",

Some of them invested in crypto, cause this time they couldn't resist (same as .com in 1999). There will never ever be mass adoption of crypto as a speculative asset. Never. Fact 2: bitcoin is either a speculative asset or a payment method. It cannot be both. You won't buy bread with a coin that can lose half of its value in one minute. If it remains a speculative asset, the price of 20.000 in december is extremely high. Going back to that price is going to be very very difficult, because you simply need average joe, who lost money on crypto and tends to not come back and doesn't like speculation. Fact 3: institutions won't invest in crypto as long as volatility is so high. Not a single institution is going to gamble with people's money (retirement funds, banks). Way too risky and governments won't allow it. If btc loses it's volatility and institutions step in, it cannot bring big gains anymore. This is pure logic. If you think about these things, the conclusion is very simple: it's going to be a hell of a job to get back at 20.000 and might take years or never happen. And by the way, what is wrong with btc attaining 20.000 in 2022. It's a fantastic ROI if you invest now. ",

The price doesn't matter when there's no exposure. The price went up a couple of times the last past months. It didn't attract new investors whatsoever. Unlike in 2017, when price increase went along with EXPOSURE in the media. Exposure is what you need to bring up the price first, or else nothing happens. ",
