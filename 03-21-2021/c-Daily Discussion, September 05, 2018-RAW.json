I can understand why bears or anyone who want to take advantage of how emotional people her in this space. This was honestly a small blip at best until people started freaking out and letting others who only come out of hiding to troll influence their choices.  Kind of wish that after you sold there was a mandatory wait period before you can buy back in. We have seen worse than this.  Weak hands need to sell and stay out of the market for their mental health. ",

This system will eventually drive other nations into hyperinflation, just matter of time, and now, it started to show in some nations. some people might argue 1. gold should be used as standard currency again; surely it worked back in Stone Age. 2. government will eventually put more regulations on BTC; still, the total BTC  volume will be finite, no ONE SINGLE NATION can manipulate it. 3. governments can create their own cryptocurrency; good luck with that and hope there will be no war for one nation to convince others to use its currency, otherwise, it is simply USD game reset.

It's a hobby right now (I have many hobbies as I am retired), so although I'd like to make some \"real\" money, earning BTC is interesting to me. If I can reduce the fees, I will see more of what I'm earning, which is the reason for my questions.",

Frankly you would have to have your head up your arse to not see it.\n\nIn the stock market you buy a share of a revenue producing asset. Each share entitles you to a portion of the profit that entity returns each year, and a return in the event the company is sold. This gives a fundamental value to each share.\n\nThe price of each share is its speculative value. This speculation prices in whether the market thinks the fundamentals of the company will improve and at what rate.\n\nBitcoin is just speculative. The only value in holding a coin is to exchange it, either for fiat or a greater fool. There is no fundamental value underpinning the price.\n\nThis is a very large philosophical difference.\n",

If you send your BTC to an exchange like coinbase, you can set the fees on the outbound transaction to some low value, but don't make it too low. Then on coinbase you can set a limit sell to sell the coin with 0 fees, then just withdraw the cash. That's probably the cheapest option.",

I also had a couple of issues with his predictions which I feel are low quality posts. I have even called him out a couple of times on his posts. \n\nHowever, I don't agree with censorship or banning, same as I don't agree with misinformation or alternative facts. There are at least two sides to every story however and I would rather the full story as to why he was banned (if he was) than rather assuming it was because he was simply bearish. I therefore can't offer an opinion on that until I'm given the facts. \n\nThus, I would suggest it would be more prudent to not assume that anyone who was bearish has been banned without any supporting evidence.\n\n&#x200B;",

I wouldn't describe the way you used to speak as extremely polite, anyone who had an experience with you would probably agree there. You definitely called people names or questioned peoples intelligence and suggested they were lacking. In all honesty, I disagree with you on many issues, including the outlandish claims for bitcoin dying. It sucks you got banned, I would like to know why though before forming any opinion on it.\n\nUnfortunately it seems like you're now peddling that this happened to a bunch of bears, I'd say this is nothing more than a conspiracy theory at the moment and you have a burden of proof before this becomes a feasible theory.",
