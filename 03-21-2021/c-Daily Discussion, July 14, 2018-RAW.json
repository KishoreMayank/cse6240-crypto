            "Text": "For those just tuning in, here's a brief update. \n\n\nHumans did a pretty solid job of tracking who owed who what for thousands of years, until Roosevelt in [June of 1933](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard), decided the US was so big and powerful, its money didn't actually have to be backed by gold anymore. People would just trust  everything was working totally fine, and various people that didn't, were imprisoned, droned or freedom-bombed until their desert countries were a sheet of highly compliant glass.\n\n\nA central bank was entrusted with the job of ~~fucking with~~ 'regulating' markets by both 1) adjusting interest rates, under the auspices of 'stimulating' or 'cooling off' the economy, and 2) printing more money, with no ability to audit how much is printed or why, a plan just as utterly insane as it sounds. \n\n\nTo nobody's surprise whatsoever, the money printers and their friends and colleagues became fabulously wealthy, the economy always seemed to need 'stimulus', rates slowly creeped down to zero and stayed there, and with only one tool in the box and a looming [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), central banks turned the money printers up to 11, roughly [$90 billion a month](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp) because YOLO, the next generation can sort this mess out, I'm going to play golf. \n\n\nJapan, the UK, EU and other countries were intrigued by this new 'print metric shit tons of money cause YOLO' technology, and created money printers of their own because well, who *wouldn't* want an ATM in their living room shitting out $34,722 a second in perpetuity. \n\n\nI'll refer to this scenario as 'The Trap', where the day-to-day effects for 98% of the population involve this strange, nagging doubt that no matter how hard you work, how far you advance in your career, or how much you save, it's like trying to blow up an inflatable mattress with several large holes in it. For the 2% that are making absurd amounts of money, their 'job' now is chiefly convincing the other 98% that everything is totally fine, unemployment is great, that [tsunami of debt](http://www.usdebtclock.org) shouldn't be a problem, [debt-to-GDP ratios](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp) can safely be ignored, Keynesian economics is 'on fleek' and inflation is only robbing you if you're a complete idiot and keep your money in cash instead of stocks, real estate, businesses and the like, and no, it's not their problem that [63% of people can't write a check for a $500 emergency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/06/63-of-americans-dont-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-500-emergency/) maybe you should get a job you bum. \n\n\nEscaping The Trap is a nightmare that only a malevolent, vengeful God could have ideated and executed on. \n\n\nThe easiest solution is to be born one of the 2%. Boom, problem solved, your life is now on easy mode, like an endless series of birthday parties that everyone knows you don't deserve.\n\n\nBarring that, you can also get educated, learn about economics, game theory, foster a healthy skepticism for governments and corporations who want to 'help make things easier for you', fall into a well-paying job, save money, don't get sick and somehow, due to that nerd-friend taking about it until you just want him to shut the hell up, invest in a highly volatile, experimental, risky, brand-new asset class while ignoring all your clueless coworkers, friends and family telling you 'wait, isn't that illegal?', 'the Feds will just outlaw it' and 'you're throwing your money away on that ponzi thing', and invest a bit. \n\n\n*you are here*",

When the CBOE received approval to begin trading futures contracts of BTC last year BTC ended its bear market and rallied from under $2,000 to $20,000.\n\nThe SEC has denied prior ETF applicants due to their lack of insurance and lack of infrastructure, the CBOE has met both these requirements. If the SEC were to approve a party to begin ETF purchasing of crypto, whom better than the CBOE? The bear market should begin to rebound due to ETFs entering the crypto market, along with hundreds of billions of dollars in institutional money.\n\nAs more and more cryptos prove to be secure, transparent and successful, there will likely be a rally in the next few months. Experts predict that this rally will not happen until the fourth quarter of 2018 unless the SEC does approve ETF entrance into the crypto space (which if I were a betting man, I\u2019d say the CBOE meets the stringent SEC requirements).\n\n\u2014-\n\nhttps://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bear-trend-end-soon/",

            "Text": "Use of bitcoin to launder money in the Russian indictment released yesterday:  \n\nCOUNT TEN (Conspiracy to Launder Money)\n\n56. Paragraphs 1 through 19, 21 through 49, and 55 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.\n\n57. To facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity\u2014including hacking into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and releasing the stolen documents\u2014the Defendants conspired to launder the equivalent of more than $95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\n58. Although the Conspirators caused transactions to be conducted in a variety of currencies, including U.S. dollars, they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains, and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity. Many of these payments were companies located in the United States that provided payment processing services to hosting companies, domain registrars, and other vendors both international and domestic. The use of bitcoin allowed the Conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.\n\n59. All bitcoin transactions are added to a public ledger called the Blockchain, but the Blockchain identifies the parties to each transaction only by alpha-numeric identifiers known as bitcoin addresses. To further avoid creating a centralized paper trail of all of their purchases, the Conspirators purchased infrastructure using hundreds of different email accounts, in some cases using a new account for each purchase. The Conspirators used fictitious names and addresses in order to obscure their identities and their links to Russia and the Russian government. For example, the dcleaks.com domain was registered and paid for using the fictitious name \u201cCarrie Feehan\u201d and an address in New York. In some cases, as part of the payment process, the Conspirators provided vendors with nonsensical addresses such as \u201cusa Denver AZ,\u201d \u201cgfhgh ghfhgfh fdgfdg WA,\u201d and \u201c1 2 dwd District of Columbia.\u201d\n\n60. The Conspirators used several dedicated email accounts to track basic bitcoin transaction information and to facilitate bitcoin payments to vendors. One of these dedicated accounts, registered with the username \u201cgfadel47,\u201d received hundreds of bitcoin payment requests from approximately 100 different email accounts. For example, on or about February 1, 2016, the gfadel47 account received the instruction to \u201c[p]lease send exactly 0.026043 bitcoin to\u201d a certain thirty-four character bitcoin address. Shortly thereafter, a transaction matching those exact instructions was added to the Blockchain.\n\n61. On occasion, the Conspirators facilitated bitcoin payments using the same computers that they used to conduct their hacking activity, including to create and send test spearphishing emails.\n\nAdditionally, one of these dedicated accounts was used by the Conspirators in or around 2015 to renew the registration of a domain (linuxkrnl.net) encoded in certain X-Agent malware installed on the DNC network.\n\n62. The Conspirators funded the purchase of computer infrastructure for their hacking activity in part by \u201cmining\u201d bitcoin. Individuals and entities can mine bitcoin by allowing their computing power to be used to verify and record payments on the bitcoin public ledger, a service for which they are rewarded with freshly-minted bitcoin. The pool of bitcoin generated from the GRU\u2019s mining activity was used, for example, to pay a Romanian company to register the domain dcleaks.com through a payment processing company located in the United States.\n\n63. In addition to mining bitcoin, the Conspirators acquired bitcoin through a variety of means designed to obscure the origin of the funds. This included purchasing bitcoin through peer-to-peer exchanges, moving funds through other digital currencies, and using pre-paid cards. They also enlisted the assistance of one or more third-party exchangers who facilitated layered transactions through digital currency exchange platforms providing heightened anonymity.\n64. The Conspirators used the same funding structure\u2014and in some cases, the very same pool of funds\u2014to purchase key accounts, servers, and domains used in their election-related hacking activity.\n\na. The bitcoin mining operation that funded the registration payment for dcleaks.com also sent newly-minted bitcoin to a bitcoin address controlled by \u201cDaniel Farell,\u201d the persona that was used to renew the domain linuxkrnl.net. The bitcoin mining operation also funded, through the same bitcoin address, the purchase of servers and domains used in the GRU\u2019s spearphishing operations, including accounts- qooqle.com and account-gooogle.com.\n\nb. On or about March 14, 2016, using funds in a bitcoin address, the Conspirators purchased a VPN account, which they later used to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used on or about April 28, 2016, to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com website.\n\nc. The Conspirators used a different set of fictitious names (including \u201cWard DeClaur\u201d and \u201cMike Long\u201d) to send bitcoin to a U.S. company in order to lease a server used to administer X-Tunnel malware implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks, and to lease two servers used to hack the DNC\u2019s cloud network.\n",

            "Text": "Great stuff! \n\nBut i will write my view on this situation. \n\nFirst i dont know where you all guys and girls live but that is insignificant. Here is situation as i see it, and it is not personal for you  \n\n[paperraincoat](https://www.reddit.com/user/paperraincoat)  but i liked your comment . \n\nThe situation is pretty simple but it is hard to formulate so that majority understands. The thing is majority of people who are in age group 18-30 years live with their parents because income rate for young professionals of any industry is at the minimum level (depends from country) average 1000 EUR a month (salary) for some it is a lot and for some it is pocket money. If you look for data about people able to work form 16-pension that number varies but in most countries it drops like stone, meaning that less people should earn more money to support their communities via taxes. This creates a problem of  insufficiency of money  funds to pay for services by government. These institutions then borrow money from bank, fund, or sells government bonds to fund their responsibilities. The problem is that all the money is already digital and endless. People think that it is covered by gold, silver or land , but it is so only in 10 \\% of all the cases. In most cases EU, USA, CHINA, JAPAN just print money and release it in market.  Banks use fractional reserve banking system and basically loans you numbers in their systems but you have to earn that money and pay interest. There is nothing bad  but this situation makes inflation and every thing gets more expensive, gas, electricity, food prices are going up about 2-8\\% a year but it is by little so you get used to it. When inflation kicks in your salary  stays the same for about a year and your boss says to you: We cant rise your salary because our sales dropped and we just cant sorry. So you work for your salary but prices go up by inflation. \n\nMost of young people cant afford to buy their place so they take mortgage and buy house but because of the fact that governments are printing money your salaries stay low but interest rates go up by a lot to out run inflation and interest on borrowed money ([https://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/overview/overview.asp](https://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/overview/overview.asp)) you can find out how much precisely. This creates a loop of infinite interest payments and endless road of poverty. Money is worthless but it is fixed to gold RIGHT when inflation rises they rise the price of gold and that is the way they fight it but in reality they just change numbers on their screen and simple people live worse. Now comes bitcoin, best thing ever from every perspective. Opinions differ but some say that it has no covered value, my view is that it is a server with multiple functions, you have money function that IS cheaper than using international bank transfers. You have a world wide server infrastructure already in operational state (miners) and it is a finite 17 million is mined and rest 4 million coins will be mined trough to year 2140 so it is a lot of years. If you know there is a blockchain word involved in bitcoin conversations, what is this chain of blocks? It is a operational server that at the moment does only ledger functions but can be used as a server that earns money by storing your information, i like example of web page, how many domains you can name and how much does it cost to maintain it? About 15 USD a month. How many domains there are? A lot and there will be more. Old  BTC transactions are kept on ledger and when you make your mining node you download all of it but is there any use of it ? NO but you could replace it with service of storing zipped information on these blocks and get commission from it so it becomes an income source. In a time when energy is a painful and expensive thing there is a thought that it is not economically viable to mine BTC it is rubbish 70 TWh per year it  is 1/20 of Germany electricity needs a year. It is done to make it sound bad so that people sell, all the negative news, are done out of the same reason. Because banking is so good business that no one will let some BTC take their profits away it is 50 trillion industry [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2tKg3E53DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2tKg3E53DM) . And they are making laws in a lot of countries to tax it like a security or commodity and it is coming all over earth. Because banks, funds and people will buy it and pump the price even more than last year. So it is a trend that is very attractive to people that live in poor or countries with high inflation. Because your BTC price is last exchange deal price \\* circulating supply= market cap and you can pump it and when it crashes it redistributes it self naturally and the next wave will be higher than previous one. Some will have more and some will have less as always. And if you read you can find out that about 4 million bitcoins are lost (no one can access their account what ever reason) and all the mining is done for last 4 million coins and you have 120 years to do it so it is useless to mine because computers evolve with amazing speed and that increases difficulty of mining and the competition level of who will make more powerful miner. The trap as you say is living by the old rules and working by the rules. All this invention (BTC) has done is revolutionize the idea that you can gather funds trough Internet , make company that offers some service or product and sell it in open market, the thing is that these new companies dont need office space, that much employees because every thing is getting automated and more accessible thanks to the internet and it is the future of business and banking. Buy BTC or any other good coin and you will be rewarded.  ",

In this instance bitcoin fell from $6370 to $6040 briefly. Shortly after that was posted! But that price must have been so tempting to buyers, it shot up.

But you also have to consider that the converse is equally true, i.e., those people who spread only good news to artificially pump the price so that they can later dump at a higher price, and which often ends up distorting the price downwards in a way worse then if they had done nothing at all.\n\nThat's why BTC and all crypto have a bad reputation among investors right now, which is that December 2017 was simply a massive pump-and-dump. Of course, nobody complained about all that fake good news when they thought they were getting rich, i.e., greed took over. In retrospect, BTC would have been better off had the December 2017 bubble never developed and it had continued its slow and steady growth. Now, there is a very real possibility that BTC is mortally wounded because the biggest investors who really drive investments markets will forever stay away.",

I've reviewed several proposed portfolio allocation charts. It's almost certain to happen eventually, but I am not so naive as to think this is going to occur tomorrow.",

            "Text": "BTC has always been a store of value from Day 1.  How else do you think I bought stuff with it?\n\nAs an alternative to Gold, it must first be accepted as an international currency, then carry enough weight to be a reserve currency.  Gold is valuable because of this reason - it is held as reserve by governments to finance imports in case it's own currency is rejected.  \n\nSo the claim that BTC is \"Digital Gold\" today is BS.  It needs first to be accepted as a currency then elevate to being accepted by governments as solid enough to be held in reserves.  This is when it becomes Digital Gold.\n\nNow you understand why the claim that BTC will replace fiat is retarded?  Acceptance by governments for international settlement is a pre-requisite to BTC becoming a Gold alternative.  And you can't achieve that by attempting to undermine the primary lever for fiscal governance, which is government control of fiat.",

That's what this guy does in all comments. He truly believes he is correct!! Its astonishing.\nIf you want some really interesting perspectives from a few guys that actually have a 'real' credible perspective on the Bitcoin as gold concept, watch this debate. They both make great points and Erik swayed the audience from minority to majority believing that Bitcoin can function as gold. Again, these are credible experts, not some blow hard moron on reddit :)\nhttps://youtu.be/S47aJ6NPC4E",
