Don't follow this and you will shit your pants during a bear market and also shit your pants during a bull market. \n\nYes, it is possible to always find that sweet balance where your investment is meaningful enough to stay actively interested in the market yet still sticking to the above rule. That sweet spot is what you need to find for yourself. ",

            "Text": "Hashrate falling is not a major threat for Bitcoin. When mining becomes unprofitable, some miners start switching off and this manifests in lower hashrate and slower blocks. But every 2016 blocks, the difficulty adjusts such that with the average hashrate seen over the previous 2016 blocks, the new difficulty would again see 10 min blocks on average. The reduced difficulty eases the situation for remaining miners. If it is still unprofitable, the same thing repeats and miners who remain into next difficulty cycle again see better times. This happens until enough miners leave and the adjusted difficulty once again makes mining profitable for the miners who remained. \n\nThe only problem can be if a very large proportion of miners left together in the middle of a 2016 block cycle in which case the remaining blocks can take a very long time to finish this putting pressure on transaction confirmations and fees. But with the competitive decentralised nature of bitcoin mining, it rarely happens that miners will leave together at the same time, especially as mining costs vary vastly across the globe.",

I ask whether most of these posters are sheep who post just for the high of self validation or do they truly believe in their naysayer logic? How come their doom and gloom logic seems to get more strengthened on red days?",

Nobody could possibly know. There's not a lot of Craig Wrights out there with millions, willing to sell their holdings at these prices to fuel a feud with their rival. Anyone that's been holding since before last year, and has not already sold would need a pretty strong reason to sell now. If it's profit taking, they'd have likely already sold at previous much higher prices, so there would have to be some scenario that's changed that required them to liquidate, and that's not something anyone here knows. What we're seeing here now is profit taking between 3700 and 4200, and this could go on for as long as the people involved are able to milk it. As for a more dramatic drop or rise in the market price, well that rides 100% on the speculation that has been the strategy of valuation since day 1.",

They're loaded with cash and throwing parties in Las vegas/los angeles/new york/qatar/london/paris, but deliver nothing, meanwhile nobody wants to buy their failed apps. I wouldn't spend a single shekel on them. They need a roadmap of 1,5 years to launch a company and build an app? Are you kidding me? Give me 500 dollars and i'll start a company tomorrow. People put 800 million in cheap ass companies that sell empty air? 3 billion in dodgecoin? fcking lmao. How about these people are completely delusional. You'd hardly find a company on planet earth worth more than a billion. At least dotcom companies made money DURING the crash. They delivered. Cryptocompanies are a complete utter failure at the moment and people start to realize that. And can we please stop with those sob stories about Venezuela? These people don't need bitcoin, they need to start working and build up their country. For god sake, you don't even need an education in 2018, just read internet, all information is available, all scientific information, everything. Stop being lazy and start making money. So, there is this intelligent guy with good education from Venezuela on this board. Instead of using his skill and education to enter the world online boundless market, either with a company or as a freelancer - and start making money - people tell him to put all his money in crypto and treat him like an eternal victim with no skills and brains. Worst advice ever given, wasted 5 years of his life, could have been rich by making right decisions - no education needed. ",

            "Text": "It is just good business to buy now. Bitcoin needs to be almost dead to be reborn due to 2 things:\n\n1. Killing weak hands like medicine kills the disease. We don't need people who don't believe in it, or even worse don't even know what the tech is capable of.\n2. Kill shitcoins as much as possible. This is unhealthy for the crypto world because of the lack of \"smart money\". Useless coins, such as Dogecoin, are sucking the potential from other serious projects, like EOS, XLM, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce those people sell, and those shitty \"projects\" are dead, then be aware; the bear market end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor possible \"bottoms\" no one knows actually, I predicted a bottom of around $2k for this to happen 6 months ago, based on my TA 8 months ago it should have been $4.5k. This encapsulates basically that no one knows where the bottom is, but... people who bought at the top 3 years ago are on the greens today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the long run we will win anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that, once everyone thought Bitcoin invincible then it fell, now people are thinking BTC is dead...",

You see very few periods where you made losses and many where you made gains. So high return low risk. Bingo.\n\nBuy by the same logic, now they will evaluate it as high risk low return by looking only at 2018 data. This ensures that those buying in now are a strong hodler layer which lay a sold new base for the next rise. And that lasts until the next round of noob logic kicks in...",

            "Text": ">Bitcoin with Segwit and Lightning will be the greatest payment system in human history. Personal labor and trading that labor with each other, is something that has never changed nor will ever change in human evolution. We just need a better medium of exchange for our labor. With that, human evolution will speed up faster than during the industrial revolution did.\n\nSomething becomes a payment system from the moment it is used as a payment system to actually PAY for things. From day one, btc was a mean to speculate, like a slot machine in Las Vegas, and now, after 10 years it still has the same function. When I make a car, it doesn't become an airplane after 10 years, just like that. This is not a bearmarket, this is an EXISTENTIAL problem. One could say:  what's wrong with it being a speculative asset? Thing is, that idea only can last some time, because it doesn't have an underlying value. Then people will say: but its value is that you can transfer money within a trustless system. Yes, that's only a real value IF it's a payment system and is used to pay things. You see the flawed logic? Crypto has a fundemental problem, something the .com companies didn't have after the crash.",

You've bought in to the sterotype that all bitcoin investors over invested and are now crying through a living nightmare. You also assume everyone bought only since last year. Do you realize how shallow and over dramatic that perspective is??\n\nFor every one person who made such an irresponsible and dramatic all-in decision, I believe there are thousands who simply put a small 'risk portion' of their investments in bitcoin to have some skin in the game. Even now as prices are beat up, I have ZERO issue with averaging down using 5% of the money I put in stocks. I'm more than willing to take the risk without even an ounce of stress, because I believe that both bitcoin and the crypto market will be here for many years, and continue to experience radical highs and lows. I'm looking ahead a hell of a lot further than last year's high and this year's low. Some of us actually enjoy the risk, and enjoy following this entire space, so please stop painting us all with the same brush.",

People with money in coins may have to start taking it out if they lose their jobs.\n\nBitcoin has always been viewed with suspicion because it has little to no intrinsic value. The reason why it boomed is probably because it seemingly had a flawless track record of constant growth.  This year has devastated that credential.

            "Text": "I believe that not much will happen with crypto when there is a financial crisis. Also, you just don't want a financial crisis. The last one caused alot of friction and problems in western societies, all over the world: ISIS, terrorism, hate, unemployment, anxiety, political crisis, insecurity, angry people, etc. It diminishes the quality of life. People want to have peace on their mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt also depends on what sort of crisis. If it's inflation or a currencyproblem like in Venezulea and Turkey (highly unlikely in western world), crypto might benefit. If it's rising unemployment, people will have less money to spend. If it's a banking crisis again (highly unlikely so soon after the previous one), crypto might benefit directly. If it's plummeting stockmarkets, people will look at safe ways like gold and silver.  There will of course be a new crisis, but you better not hope for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Text": "Wrong. The desired growth path is not by one person buying your stash for higher but by many more people adopting bitcoin and buying your whole stash together - each still putting in only a reasonable amount of fiat. So the bulls base their growth not on bitcoin changing hands among same number of people at ever higher prices but rather on growth due to higher number of people sharing the same fixed supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong or Ponzi like in this model. You expect more people to learn about and adopt what you as an early adopter learnt about. Nobody is getting fooled here and there is no zero sum game either. Everyone wins either by making money in fiat or by ending up with a stable bitcoin that is widely adopted.",

            "Text": "That logic is flawed in several ways. Bitcoin can and is being used by a lot of people in countries with very high inflation rates. It's being used to transfer money across borders without permission/limits/high transfer fees. It's being used in online gambling. Some small and mid size businesses not only accept it but actually offer a discount when you pay with it, because it saves them credit card fees. It has value because of that and many other reasons including the fact that many people think it has value. Also that car/plane comparison misses the point. Bitcoin is more like the engine that was used in cars and later developed to move planes. I think you need to research something before bashing it. ",

Saying bitcoin was a means to speculate is actually pretty insulting to the people who got the ball rolling on all this.\n\nThe more people that own it, with fixed supply, the more valuable it will become. Then just like digging shiny rocks out of the ground back before we had the internet to facilitate transfer, bitcoin can easily become a newer, more accountable, easier to exchange place holder and far better suited to a digital age. Then, in time don't worry - It will likely get to be the currency it can be but it will be generations from now.",

The BIGGEST point missed by most trolls on here is simple: They think last year's bubble saturated the market, when the reality is, it was far too complicated and intimidating for about 85% of potential investors to even touch. I can't count how many people expressed last year that they'd have totally bought in had they felt comfortable with the getting verified on exchanges, cold storage, wallet addresses etc. Already in just a short year, Bitcoin is far easier to purchase, and with new apps, exchanges and proposed investment products coming down the pipe, it's only going to get easier. We have not come CLOSE to the level of market saturation that we can reach with Bitcoin.",

            "Text": ">That logic is flawed in several ways. Bitcoin can and is being used by a lot of people in countries with very high inflation rates. It's being used to transfer money across borders without permission/limits/high transfer fees. It's being used in online gambling. Some small and mid size businesses not only accept it but actually offer a discount when you pay with it, because it saves them credit card fees. It has value because of that and many other reasons including the fact that many people think it has value. Also that car/plane comparison misses the point. Bitcoin is more like the engine that was used in cars and later developed to move planes. I think you need to research something before bashing it.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nah, the fact a handful of people and companies use it doesn't make it useful to make payments with it. It is highly unpractical with high volatility. I may want to buy something with it, but risk losing 20% of the value, just by going out of my house and pay for a coffee. Not useful. See, as long as the volatility doesn't disappear, it cannot be used as a payment method. To reach more adoption, it must lose volatility. The problem is: when it loses its volatility, you and me won't be in crypto anymore, it won't be interesting to speculate. Also, to lose volatility, there must be more adoption. So it's a catch 22, a fundemental flaw. \n\n&#x200B;",

This has nothing to do with investment (aka looking at things clearly and draw realistic conclusions based on the market, that could be negative or positive conclusions for crypto). You say this to a stockmarket investor and he will laugh his ass off. There is no negative or positive, there is a market that could go up or down. ",

Each time there's a run up the top gets higher, and each bubble dwarfs the previous, making it appear insignificant. this entire narrative is a repeat. When the price first hit 1k that seemed like a monstrosity of a bubble at the time. The next run up will make 20k look tiny, but I am not naive enough to assume I know when that will be.",

To know that you own x% of an assets supply and that you will always retain x% is a fact that should be treated as a usecase by itself. If you don't realise it now, you will in future even if you continue looking for another 'real' use case.",

Banks are not running scared, and they are not trying to tear down bitcoin. Banks are a collective of people in controlling positions and are a mammoth compared to the crypto market. Bitcoin can succeed but as a value store first. This must take years. Once you own enough of it, you can start to spend it, but again this is literally generations away. For now, we have a speculative market where everyone wants to place their bets and you know what? It's OK. Because no publicity is bad publicity and some of the biggest innovations on the planet were nurtured and developed while first utilized in the porn, defense, gambling and gaming industries. The fact that we get a new version of the market out of this is a bonus in my mind. It gives people something to focus on while the dev team do their job. \nBitcoin can run WITH FIAT and banks can learn to benefit from it (they already have).",
