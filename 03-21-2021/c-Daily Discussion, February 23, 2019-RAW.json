And they referred to these points, without a hint of irony, as \"a bitcoin for college students\"\n\napparently anything that involves both the internet and paying for things is automatically bitcoin now. Good to see mass adoption is really taking hold.",

            "Text": "\u201cIf speculation is remotely close, the housing sector could be in the midst of a significant disruption. From shortening the transaction timetable and simplifying the closing process, to increasing trust and security, cryptocurrency has the chance to make a meaningful impact. In fact, it no longer seems to be a question of whether or not they will change the face of the real estate industry, but rather when.\u201d\n\nAgree/disagree? The real estate/housing market could be significantly benefited by using cryptocurrency to complete transactions. In 2018, the US real estate market was worth $33.3 trillion dollars (have to state the .3 since that\u2019s only $300 billion). Forget a Bitcoin ETF, the real big progression for BTC will be when a huge sector or market taps into the adoption of Bitcoin to improve efficiency or security in its own market. ",

            "Text": "It was more of an analogy than an actual description, but here in Russia the government is quite literally planning to have a kill switch for the external internet connections. As a side effect it would disconnect the whole region from Bitcoin and might even cause various disruptions outside. At such level it would indeed be a losing battle.\n\nHowever, consider what would happen if the example were to get contagious. Countries or blocks of them build disconnects, ways to isolate their internal networks from the rest of it. Russia because of the \"we are a nation under siege\" politics, USA because \"Build a Digital Wall against Russian hackers!\", European Union because USA did so, China because China, etc.\n\nThen things happen, the connections are cut, and suddenly the internet is fragmented into several blocks. Suddenly there is no longer a single network and single consensus. If the connections were to reappear a few days later, most of the world's transactions would be wiped out in a mother of all reorgs by whichever  isolated chain happens to be the longest.\n\nA global internet fragmentation event is not too hard to imagine, and it would devastate Bitcoin really quickly whether it's the intended goal or a side effect.",
