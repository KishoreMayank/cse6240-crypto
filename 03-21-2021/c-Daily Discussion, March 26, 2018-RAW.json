            "Text": "The FUD campaign is getting old. How are the mainstream media groups still pushing the story that BTC is dropping because twitter bans crypto ads. So Twitter banned ads for cryptocurrencies...WHO CARES!!! Since when are companies like Twitter trying to push some sort of agenda. Twitter, google, facebook, etc. saying things like \"It's to protect our users,\" is such a crock of shit. It is an individual's decision to invest in things with no bearing on the company who puts up a paying client's advertisement. HEY TWITTER, you would allow Coca Cola or MacDonald's to advertise...well that made me fat, so it's your fault twitter. Do we see the fault in this logic? Basically what we have is a government and \"powers that be\" smear campaign to try to disrupt our disruptive market, and guess who they're in bed with. I'll give you a hint...Google, Facebook, Twitter...their user voluntary source of info on everybody. Don't let them win, It's time to WAKE UP and stop being one of the SHEEPLE!!!",

I am known in the Canadian media as the, \"Thorn In The Side Outspoken Advocate For The Homeless\"  I am going to take my efforts to the moon and back using crypto and reddit for a huge very modern approach to assisting the homeless.  I am in beginning stages and now focused on Doge for my project.  Google Jason McComb Homeless Awareness Canada to see some of my many past successful efforts.  My newest effort is going to reach New Zealand at the same time as Canada then everywhere between.  Details are coming with a new website soon.

Almost all major altcurrencies are lower at this point than they were during the crash at 6th of February, while bitcoin is hovering just below 8k. This is about 2k higher than its lowest point this year in comparison.\n\nWhile bitcoin has bled, the altbleeding has been far more severe, contributing to leverage bitcoin's market dominance. As a newcomer, the situation shows me in practical terms the level of stability that bitcoin possess under pressure in comparison to its forks. If the recent crashes have been a correction of sorts, it appears that the most noticeable sets of overvaluations have involved the alts.\n\nWhen bitcoin is sufficiently undervalued it will bounce as a result of the degrees of profitability involved. If I remember correctly the last time it bounced was at about 2% over the McAfee line; we're seeing the price hovering at 4.5% over that line at the moment. It will be interesting to see how it performs this time. Not saying that I agree with McAfee's prediction - I don't, however his prediction provides a direct line to compare the low-end spectrum of the price with.",

The cryptomarket is still very much in its infancy. The blockchain technology is a world changer, wait for it to be used . So you lost a few hundred of dollars, so what. When this bear market is over, btc starts bouncing back up at a ridiculous speed. Just be smart this time and lock in profits",

Like Apple or the Internet or something that in the 1980s.  We just have to wait until it's the world currency, like Thiel has predicted.\n\nSecond thing to remember is that even if we never make any money, it doesn't matter, because we are in it for the tech.  And freedom, fighting governments, banks, and so on.   Providing anonymity and control over one's own money.    We are the vanguard of a revolution such as the world have never seen.\n\nSo, even if it sinks to $1 per BTC, we still win!   ",

I think this market is really starting to stabilize. The lower in price we get, the less likely a 1000 dip day is, IMO. A trader looking for a 3-7% flip can pretty well assume we will see 8,600 again in the next week.\n\nOf course it could totally go lower before it raises again, but after 600 dip, I think it is more likely we hit our recently common 8,500 mark, than dipping >800. People are buying in the 7's at mass so it doesn't stick for long. I'm selling and making money as soon as I see $8,600 again.",

If you set your stoplosses at for example $8001,- a 1 dollar spread is probably enough beceause there should be laying a shit ton on $8000,-. But if you are setting you stoploss for example on $7999,- you better set a spread of atleast $30,- if you want to be almost 100% sure your order gets filled (because the momentum/stoplosses triggered when going trough such an important support most of the times will push the price significantly lower in 1 instant without filling any of your sell orders if set to tight).

In my opinion, HODL = Holding On Despite Logic.  Personally, I think those \"idiots\" will get a chance to buy back in at $5K, not $50K.  Bitcoin will never be adopted as currency on a wide scale.  The governments of the world will not allow it.  It is too volatile to use as currency and even President Trump's new Director of the National Economic Council, said, \"Bitcoin is not real money.\"  So what is the technology worth?  Let's be aggressive and say $10,000,000,000.00 (actually blockchain is free but we will ignore that for the sake of argument).  So that would put the bitcoin price in the $800 range.  And once 21 million Bitcoin are mined, the value would be $476 (where it was not all that long ago) based upon a $10 Billion valuation.  But I am open to other viewpoints and would love for someone to explain to me why bitcoin should be worth more than $10 Billion, let alone the $140 Billion we see today.",

They account for almost 70% of everyone currently in crypto. Having lost huge amounts of money, they are panicking, exiting and never coming back to crypto. Banks are preventing the previously easy fiat on-boarding to crypto markets by restricting credit and debit card purchases (and soon wire transfers). Without the ease of buying cryptos and people thinking they are so smart by shorting they are forcing the market price lower. Except there are no longer the new buyers to pick up the falling price. Everyone outside of the current crypto community only sees that it was once $20k and now is $8k and is not willing to ever risk their money in such a market. The further it falls, the less people that will ever buy in or accept the idea of crypto without it offering some massive benefit of profit to them personally, they\u2019d rather risk it in the equity market and get the government support and taxation benefits.\n",

            "Text": "> Bitcoin will never be adopted as currency on a wide scale. The governments of the world will not allow it. \n\nMoney is one of the most important things that a government controls.   And quite rightly so.   The idea that any government, let alone world governments, will give up that control in favor of some fuzzy internet product is extremely naive and show serious delusion in some places.    \n\nOn top of that bitcoin is nearly useless as a currency: very few places take it (the ones that claim to simply directly convert into fiat) and hardly anybody uses it for anything, whence the excitement that brings people here to report that \"I just bought a T-shirt with bitcoin!\".    Further, 99.9999999% of the populace see little that bitcoin can offer then over traditional banking.   They are interested in loans, mortgages, easily paying for goods and services, credit-card protections on purchases, etc.    \"Decentralized\", \"anonymous\", etc. meaning little to them.\n\nWhat bitcoin does allow is the opportunity to participate in a lottery in which there can be many winners.   Of course, as in any lottery, the prizes come from the contributions of the other participants. So, in a sense, those who claim that there is wealth distribution taking place are right, but in a rather perverse way.",

Particularly since they have failed to issue regular guidance on the matter of the taxability of small btc payments.  But the taxation of rental income is well established.  Like cash, if you deposit it and you get audited failing to declare it is evasion.  \n\nAnd as it stands today, all btc buys and sells are likely available and subject to discovery by the IRS.  They don't necessarily have the manpower to chase down everybody, but most big transactions are juicy targets, and a certain number of small filers get randomly audited every year.\n\nLandlording is a great way to pay a mortgage and build a real estate portfolio.  The tax advantages can be substantial.  A good tax accountant would probably tell you being able to depreciate property and write off repairs will help you more than declaring the income will hurt you.  \n\nI have always declared every dollar and encouraged my tax pro to take every legal deduction and that decision has paid off in every way.  A bad audit or criminal prosecution can crush you.  Only the young and inexperienced would ever counsel hiding bitcoin profits when the truth is a random audit could cost you the house.",

            "Text": "I'm of the opinion that wallet to wallet small transfers are the least likely to attract attention in accumulated metadata.  Profligate activity buying and/or selling on an exchange is more likely to be discoverable.  Attachment is usually not the problem.  Once the IRS suspects you they audit and ask you direct questions under oath.  Although we now know the NSA has enormous troves of bitcoin address files, they probably don't share with the IRS.  But you don't want to be in an audit with something to hide.  Bitcoin is a terrific piece of tech.  Every country will want to tax it pursuant to their specific laws.  That taxation doesn't lessen bitcoin's appeal.  And bitcoin's appeal was never based on tax evasion.  I promise you bitcoin whales are paying taxes on their bitcoin sales.  If you don't want to pay the kind of outrageous taxes that stock day traders pay based on frequent buys and sells, then don't day trade.  Transfer all your crypto holdings into the coin(s) you believe in hodling, then review your positions once a year.  Every time you sell a coin for a profit its a taxable event in the U.S.  And if you're a citizen of the U.S. you have to declare all foreign accounts every time you file a  tax return, so trading on foreign exchanges doesn't provide privacy, it encourages audits.",

            "Text": "This is a watershed year in the world of bitcoin and crypto taxation.  The IRS has forced the disclosure of Coinbase clients who transacted more than 10,000 worth of buys/sells a year for 2014 and 2015.  That put everyone on notice.  We all know that its fun and popular and sometimes profitable to trade coin, buy and sell coin to coin, and ratchet up holdings.  This is the game, a huge part of the appeal, the way to wealth.  But you must understand that regulation of the exchanges and ICOs by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and \"notice\" by the IRS that they intend to treat profit from coin sales as ordinary income from the sale of property changes the game.  It doesn't change the amazing thing that is bitcoin.  But you must adjust your game to make sure you don't violate laws.  Adopting a youthful attitude that they won't catch you, or that there is some way to avoid taxation is dangerous.  Part of the experience of gaining wealth and obtaining assets and enjoying the ride to financial prosperity is freedom from the fear of incarceration or having it all taken away.  You must up your game to include the same reality of taxation that adults in every other profit making venture face.  This is the year to put your accounts and affairs in order.  Keep a hard copy of every important trade and its value at execution.  And plan to file an honest tax return.  There is a certain confidence that comes from knowing that you can make large sums of money honestly.",
