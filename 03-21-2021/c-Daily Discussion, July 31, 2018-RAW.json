About a week ago the BTC price went down and they're all writing about a bearish market. A couple of days it went up a little bit and they were all reacting saying this is the start of the bullrun and pointing out all the indicators. Today BTC has dropped a bit and they're mostly forecasting a drop to $7400 or less and possibly a drop to <$6800.\n\nTell me something people, am I right in thinking that in Twitter-Bitcoin-land nobody knows shit?",

If you want to enjoy the freedom bitcoin offers, STOP resisting the technology that will eventually be implemented. \n\nYou are fighting against technology that will be used and is needed for second layer solution. The bitcoin core tried the diplomatic way but this technology will succeed better without you holding it back. As soon as Segwit and Lightning are 100%..... no more alt coins. \n\nAdopt the inevitable so you can live to see the revolution it brings, if not and you continue to delay what is definitely going to be implemented into the BIP.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t fight to stay decentralized for you people to drag your feet and not implement superior technology.

Stock futures are floating slightly higher this morning as the Personal Consumption Expenditures index data are due at 8:30am Eastern. Market expectations for the Core PCE, excluding food and energy prices, are for a 2% year over year rise. Anything significantly above that and we could see a jump in bond yields (especially given the record amount of treasury debt being issued currently) and gold prices. The Federal Open Market Committee concludes its meeting on Wednesday and announces its rate decision at 2pm. Rates are expected to be held steady, as there is no press conference organized post decision, which usually means nothing will be changed.

The CBOE can offer this. If you offer insurance, more people will invest with peace of mind, and that volume will generate a great return on the investment of insurance for the CBOE... making everyone on both sides happy. If this is approved, then buying BTC at this price will pay off greatly sooner than later. If its not, well it's just a delay not a full stop.",
