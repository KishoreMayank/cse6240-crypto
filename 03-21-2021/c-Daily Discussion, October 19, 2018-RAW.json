I guarantee you, a million positive articles and extremely positive news the coming 6 months, STILL won't get him back. He'll ONLY come back if, and only if crypto is partially adopted.\n\n20.000 is EXTREMELY high. We needed MASSIVE amount of publicity to get that price. I mean, it was MASSIVE. That's how much exposure you need to get back at 20.000. Bitcoin must be the talk of the town, people must talk about it at birthday parties, msms daily reports, 5 billion ico ads a month on facebook, etcetera etcetera. That's how much HYPE needs to be created to get back at 20.000. People can't imagine how much exposure btc needs to get back to 20.000. It won't happen within 3 months, won't happen within 6 months, not within a year. It can only happen if there's a major shift or crisis in the economy. LN, good news and those kind of small futile details won't change anything. That's all fanboytalk. The reality of the market doesn't care about fanboys and their delusional minds. ",

Navigating bitcoin as a newbie right now is incredibly complex and scary.  I just had to shoot an e-mail off to Coinbase recently because the math behind how they calculate their balances is cryptic as hell and it took me about an hour to figure out what was going on after I had already requested assistance.  Volatility in the price has little do with it.  It has *something* to do with it, but it's not the major barrier to entry right now.",

It's extremely, extremely difficult to get him back after the crash of 2018. I guarantee you, a million positive articles and extremely positive news the coming 6 months, STILL won't get him back. He'll ONLY come back if, and only if crypto is partially adopted.\n\n20.000 is EXTREMELY high. We needed MASSIVE amount of publicity to get that price. I mean, it was MASSIVE. That's how much exposure you need to get back at 20.000. Bitcoin must be the talk of the town, people must talk about it at birthday parties, msms daily reports, 5 billion ico ads a month on facebook, etcetera etcetera. That's how much HYPE needs to be created to get back at 20.000. People can't imagine how much exposure btc needs to get back to 20.000. It won't happen within 3 months, won't happen within 6 months, not within a year. It can only happen when there's a major shift or crisis in the economy. LN, good news and those kind of small futile details won't change anything. ",

            "Text": "I can't predict the future to that degree. I can imagine the possibility that if BTC value increases at a smoother predictable rate, then you can price that rate into the loan. You might borrow 500, and pay back 450 by the end of the term. The math could be done fairly easily to pay back the loan with interest, adjusting for BTC deflation rates at some regular interval. This could make it so the value you borrowed gets paid back by the end of the term with interest, and it still ends up being less BTC than you borrowed.\n\nI guess the catch here is, why would someone loan out BTC if they could just sit on it and end up with more. I can't  really explain my way around that. Maybe if the deflation rate is low enough, deflation is priced into the interest, so you get a lower rate.",

            "Text": "I know this is a really unpopular opinion here, but the advantage of centralization is that the government can tug on the strings to hopefully steer the economy in the right direction. The fed's mission is maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This way, banks can lend money with 30 year repayment plans knowing, more or less, what they need to charge in interest to profit. Obviously it's not always perfect.\n\nBut like you said, if deflation was low and easily predictable that would be enough to prevent a situation where you borrowed $50k bitcoin and have to repay it with $3,000,000 bitcoin. You'd just need to actually find someone who's willing to lend you bitcoin...\n\nOne argument I've heard is that people would be less frivolous with money and buy only what they need to survive. They'd save and pay for everything up front (cars, houses, college).\n\nPersonally this isn't a world I'd want to live in. Only the wealthy could afford to send their kids to college, which means they're probably landing all the skilled jobs, which means the poor stay poor and the wealthy stay wealthy. I'd also rather not save for 30 years to buy my house. :P\n\n",

If you realize it's never going to replace USD and doesn't belong in retirees pension funds then you do you. I'd rather YOLO on some options personally, but if crypto floats your boat that's awesome. \n\n&#x200B;",

            "Text": "I had little to put faith in during previous bear markets. There was little happening. But these days I can barely keep up with it all. If it bounced back from previous \"certain death\" I'm fairly confident that the next recovery will make the last few pale in comparison.\nNo, at least not in my lifetime will it replace the dollar. Will it run along side Fiat as an alternative currency imo? Yes, particularly for online purchases and cross border transactions. Will it become a part of pension funds? That's inevitable as far as I'm concerned. Anything that has been 20k and now 6k but still growing in terms of infrastructure will have a place in the high risk allocation of a portfolio. And people won't have any issues with 1-2% of risk or hedge.\nBy the same token, if you're skeptical, who can blame you? I just would politely suggest you not deny a reality of incredibly large sums of money invested into this space by some very  successful and intelligent people, and some very large organizations.",
