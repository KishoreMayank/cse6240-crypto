I have not pulled up cryptowat.ch and looked at the other exchanges in the same time frame yet.\n\nEDIT ADD:  Looking at Bitfinex  https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/1hr - Almost identical in price, 3375 BTC on the way up, 4760 BTC on the way down.  I'm inclined to think we just put a double top in here ~9k and we should expect a move to 8.4k.  If 8.2-8.4k can't hold we may revisit 7.3k.",

Everybody's up in arms about the price, yet they don't realize what a shitshow it is when trying to use it for its intended use.\n\nTrying to buy a laptop. Went to Newegg and found what I wanted only to find out that their 'bitcoin accepted!' is through fucking bitpay and their bullshit payment protocol code, which my wallet (samourai) doesn't accept.\n\nThought about buying a gift card for amazon or newegg from Gyft or a similar site. All of which requires me to transfer my coins back to coinbase and then I have to authorize the site (with a daily limit worth hundreds of dollars of btc) to take the money from my account.\n\nThis not what bitcoin was meant to be. We have a lot of work to do.",

            "Text": "I suggest for people to study several of the top altcurrencies and their market depth, examine where traders expect, or intend, to sell and buy. Traders bought BTC heavily at 7.5k and appear to have sold a decent amount at 9k. Some traders may have sold at 8.3k-8.8k. Considering the low volumes, I'd say that trader impact is fairly high at the moment. My observation is that there is more sell pressure than buying pressure at this point and the descent volumes have been overall higher than the ascent volumes recently.\n\nMy speculation is that the most active participants right now, traders of various kinds, are waiting for at least 8k-8.5k until they rebuy. The more patient traders probably look for 7.5k-8k.\n\nI have been wrong many times so far so don't pay attention to my speculation. However, check the market depth of both bitcoin and major altcoins yourself and make up your own mind based on the data that is available. While I had preferred to observe an upswing to 10k soon, that's not what I see yet. Add the tax season with bitcoin and altcoin owners needing to make sure to finish paying their taxes, which adds some sell pressure.\n\nAs a counterbalance to my observation, a number of miners probably will have a decent resistance to sell below 8.5k-9k. As a result, the resistance might be strong enough to keep the price over 8.5k. It is also possible that some traders might want to pump up the price to 9.5k-10k before selling, so don't take my speculation as investment advice. If the resistance is strong enough at 8.5k, then traders might have to adapt to the situation and reconsider their strategies. If not, I'd say that 8k is definitely a possibility. I doubt to see any prices below 7.5k though.",

Right now with these big swing in prices, there's a LOT of money to be made. I've been averaging $2000 a week for the last couple months. If all your Bitcoin money is in HODL, you're missing big. But it's good to keep a portion of your coins in HODL mode, in case there's a big bright future for Bitcoin down the road. But if there's not, HODLing alone would have been a big waste. ",

That's it.  Still anonymous enough, but at least you know the person talking doesn't have their head up their ass with probably $42 in BTC value.\n\nReddit is a prolapsed shithole among shitholes.",

I.e. people will buy from the exchange with lower price and sell it at a higher price on the other exchange.  What then follows is that prices are brought to the same level across the exchanges.\n\nThat's why you will always see a difference in price among the exchanges but the gaps will close.",
