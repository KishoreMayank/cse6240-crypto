Bitcoin may be a new emerging asset class, but this is still a market.\n\nAlways keep in mind: The most gains are made by those who buy in a bear market. That will NEVER change. The fact that thousands bought at 15-20k only to lose 85%, and now when it's much cheaper people are panicked and afraid to buy is baffling to anyone that has spent 10-20 years or more on markets. Avoid the noise and keep perspective.",

People do not make investment decisions in solidarity with your losses. They will look and assess for themselves whether they think Bitcoin is worth buying at current prices. It is a different debate on whether the current prices are worth buying at or not but I can tell you that one thing which is definitely an attracting rather than putting off for for new buyers is the 83% fall.\n\nHint: It was for me in 2016.",

I have held since 2011/2012 and have ridden this bitch like I was an Olympic surfer.\n\n\n\nHowever. I now have a child, took a two year employment gap and have had some fun along the way.\n\n\n\nI was 100% BTC and living from my stash. It was stressful these last few months, as I was foolish and hodl, just to watch my stash diplenish. \n\n\n\nI finally cracked and had a weak hand moment. I sold at a big overall gain, but no where near what I could have sold at ATH (same old story.) \n\n\n\nI do plan to buy back in, but I am waiting for the saucy dip. I don't have the magic 8 ball, no one here does, however, having traded actively over these years and educated myself to live off an asset that was very volatile, I strongly believe we aren't at the bottom.\n\n\n\nIronically the price pumped immediately as and when I sold.\n\n\n\nMoral of the story.  Hodl does work, if you time it right. Trading is hella fun but hella risky, I've lost and won. Greed and hope, optimism can only carry you so far.\n\n\n\nIn hindsight I should have sold at ATH, I had my sell orders set but I believed it was moon time, not dumpy monthly.\n\n\n\nAnyway, stop worrying, if you're fucked and have lost your money, I do suggest you hodl, as it SHOULD rise again.  On the other hand, don't be like me and be a fool parted with his magic Internet money. ",

All btc holders seem to believe the current volatility is due to lack of trust and the fact it's a young market. It has nothing, really nothing to do with that. The volatility is caused by fixed supply.  Btc will never ever be able to reach a point of low volatility due to fixed supply. You look at tether and you see it has low volatility.  Why? Nothing to do with trust, but with volatile supply. Even if US government came out with a statement backing btc tomorrow, btc would still be as volatile as today. People would accumulate and then dump the thing. Fixed supply sounds cool and all. In fact it leads to nowhere, as we can see these past 10 years: no adoption, no use case. Again: the fact it has no use case has nothing to do with the coin being young. It is a fundamental flaw in the plan, the idea, the system. It just doesn't work, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you see the clear picture. It is doomed to fail in the long term. ",

It hit it's tipping point with the rich elite. \"Did you hear about this new thing called cryptocurrency?\" Suddenly everyone buys in. Just like the early internet days when people spent millions for a .com address. It was stupid money, and that's what last December was. \n\nNow people know what crypto is, and that it merely is an experiment in technology. Technology changes month to month. Tech investments rise and fall lightning fast. Apple has a new iPhone every year otherwise it's stock sinks because there is no buzz on the street. \n\nBelieving in Bitcoin is like Believing in Jesus. You want to believe, but suddenly you learn about all these other religions (coins) and you start to wonder why this one over all the others. Then you do more research and find out that in order to actually BUY anything with bitcoin you have to pay MORE money to convert your cash into bitcoin. This extra step, for a lazy person, is too much work. Plus you have to have your phone on you. Screens break, batteries die. It's unreliable. Nothing about Bitcoin makes any sense in the day to day world. It's like socialism looking good on paper, but in reality is just awful.",

If you're looking for an IOS wallet i would recommend BRD wallet, Remember not your keys not your coins so never hold bitcoin on an online exchange or inside a third party's hands.",

This phrase 'institutional money is coming' is almost as stupid as 'Chinese new year'. There will never be big institutional money. It's over, the project has failed. Take your money out and feed your children. ",

We all know it's young and that the crypto market is speculation and not matured yet. That has nothing to do with how well bitcoin can serve as a currency. The price is rotating bull and bear market cycles because we're all speculating on the future use and as a market, there will be profit taking and hyped up prices etc. \nBut simply insulting buyers and saying bitcoin is dead provides zero value to this sub. The value of a bitcoin is directly correlated to how much value people choose to hold in it, and many people believe that it will continue to increase as it has been doing over the past decade as it's gone from pennies to thousands. To assume that's going to stop now just because the crypto market is in a bear period is shallow thinking. ",

Conclusion every child can draw: the coin is going nowhere. It has no underlying value. That's not what the libertarian donkey believes. He believes that btc somehow magically loses its volatility in the future, because of more trust. ''But but it's a young market'' says the libertarian donkey. Despite the fact it exists for more than 10 (!) years and the volatility is the same as ten years ago, while the amount of holders is much much larger. The libertarian donkey doesn't believe in fundamental laws like gravity, he doesn't understand simple laws even a child could understand. He lives in a bubble and shuts down every critical voice. As a last resort, he just bans people he doesn't agree with. Now tell me, how healthy is it that every Telegram group and this btc board has become an echochamber and mods are banning people all the time? In what kind of world do you fcking live?

They know getting a piece of every transaction is where the money is made.\n\nThey are putting some money into these areas more than anything else but conspiracy theorists like the ones in the video (trying to look like legit professors) draw the connections they want to see. I will also say from my experience Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest and most ethical people in the business. Along the lines of Warren Buffett.

In order for something to be viable as a speculative asset, it must have an underlying value (like stocks). That could be a store of wealth or a currency to buy something (but it is not due to high volatility). Thus, Btc is neither of those two, it has no underlying value. It keeps going up and down. Pointless. This has nothing to do with being mature. It's a fundamental flaw that we have seen for over 10 years: same volatility, same shit, same fundamental flaw. You could add 5 billion holders, price would still fluctuate massively. Because: no underlying value. \n\nHolders deserve to be insulted, not because they bought it, but because of their massive cope. If you're not able to resist criticism, you're a weak dumbass. It is what it is. \n\nFor stating this, you get banned by these dumb coping mods. ",

But I won't make another mistake by not taking advantage of the burst bubble now. If, as I expect, we reach new highs in a few years, I would be better off than if this bubble had not happened as I wouldn't have had extra time to accumulate. And accumulation is what I am doing now.",

The volatility is very expected as the price discovery process will be ongoing for many years to come. This is something we all have to accept, whether for, or against bitcoin as a currency for future generations.\n\nI think you're confusing bitcoin for a product or company share that produces a product or service, which explains your trying to understand it. An empty bank account has more value as you deposit money into it. How you value the bank account as a service to hold your money,  and any conveniences it brings you is subjective. It's a slow process but as newer generations in a digtial society come online, bitcoin has a very strong chance of being their preffered choice, particularly for internet purchases. The crypto market also provides an investment space far more aligned with a digital age. \n\nThink future, not present. Anyone can condemn current performance as a failure if you don't allow time for success. If we all did that, we'd have none of today's tech, some of which took hundreds of years to become mainstream.",

            "Text": "By the way, in order to fix this fundamental flaw, you need to leave the fixed supply. Fixed supply doesn't work. This IS the fundamental flaw of bitcoin. It seems cool in the beginning, but it leads to implosion sooner or later. Maybe crypto could work, but not btc, it is fundamentally flawed because of the fixed supply. In order to reduce volatility, you need to reduce the need for constant speculation, so that you get a more steady value. This can only be done by augmenting the supply.. It will NOT happen by adding more holders, something people think on this board. Their argument is: it's still young, when more people hold it, it will become more stable and people will use it as a currency. Absolutely not true, and the facts speak for themselves. There is a reason governments look at the supply side of currencies. It is extremely important. ''But but governments are bad and we need to get rid of them''> Says the libertarian donkey.",

You don't understand what i mean with fundamental flaw, because you don't understand the flaw. The fundamental flaw is the fixed supply. Fixed supply leads to volatility, leads to not using the coin to buy stuff, leads to the coin having no underlying value. Do you understand this? Now, you could say, but the underlying is store of wealth. No, because again: fixed supply, which leads to speculation, not a steady store of wealth. Now, you could say: but speculation could be its function, just like stocks. Yes, but ONLY if it has underlying value, like stocks or gold. So, this a vicious cycle. Do you understand the fundamental flaw now? It can be interesting for the first years, to speculate, when people still have idealistic ideas. Until people realize it has no function/underlying value, because of fundamental flaw of fixed supply. In order to fix the fundamental flaw, you need to get rid of fixed supply. Btc is doomed to fail because of fixed supply. ''But fixed supply is great, we will have no inflation!'' says the libertarian donkey, who doesn't understand fundamental laws. ",

Stating your opinion as fact instantly degrades the credibility of your input. Collaboration between varying opinions is where success is birthed. The divisible units of fixed supply allow bitcoin to scale well into the distant future, and knowing the supply would actually eliminate volatility once that supply is mass distributed. Once again, you're thinking is premature. Existing currencies took hundreds, if not thousands of years to mature.",

Stating your opinion as fact instantly degrades the credibility of your input. Collaboration between varying opinions is where success is birthed. The divisible units of fixed supply allow bitcoin to scale well into the distant future, and knowing the supply would actually eliminate volatility once that supply is mass distributed. Once again, you're thinking is premature. Existing currencies took hundreds, if not thousands of years to mature.\n\nExisting currencies took hundreds of years? What are you talking about? Show me a currency that had this extreme volatility during history? You will not be able to name one. You seem to think that with more holders, volatility will drop. This is not true, and it has been proven already. Volatility won't drop a bit. It's not the amount of holders that cause the volatility, but the fixed supply. That's why the currency of the smallest country in the world, with way less holders than btc. has way less volatility. I hope you understand the system now and why this whole project will lead to nowhere. Stop being an ideologist, look at the facts and speak about facts. ",

They will be the ones to have a proper linkage to the spot market. \n\nIf the futures contract reduces speculation then that is great. But by bitcoin adoption, I mean people holding bitcoin for the actual utility it provides I.e a way to hold value outside centralised entities and being able to make payments or transfer value without needing third parties. Futures may just replicate the speculation aspect but by no means the real utility. So on that count, scarcity for the real non speculative use case remains.",

Even if tomorrow, US government came out with a statement backing bitcoin, it still would be as volatile as today. People would accumulate because of renewed trust, and then sell till the next massive drop. The volatility is NOT due to a lack of trust, but due to speculation and lack of underlying value. It is inherent of the system Satoshi created, because of fixed supply. You can't just decide to fixate the amount and expect the system to work on its own. Fixed supply sounds cool and fun, until reality kicks in and people see the coin is going nowhere. Trust has nothing, nothing to do with this. : Look at tether: the value is pretty much stable compared to bitcoin, because of volatile supply. ",
