I remembered my non-tech savvy coworkers and family members talking about it and considering buying some.\n\nThe main reason it dropped rapidly is because people realized the technology itself was not worth that much at the time.\n\nIt is currently hovering around 6-8k only because of the few who are still consistently investing a portion of their paychecks. Based on how much time has passed since then, I believe more people are getting out of Bitcoin rather then jumping in as new investors.\n\nIf Bitcoin can ever surpass its ATH of \\~20k, it would be the real deal. In my opinion, that would be a good indication to seriously invest in Bitcoin even if it immediately drops hard below \\~20k afterwards due to whatever reasons. Thoughts?",

            "Text": ">Looks like the reality of how the evolving of transacting digitally; to supplant transacting with paper as the world knows it takes a very long time has finally baked into more brains than not.\n\nAgreed, but that may occur with the so-called fiat currencies instead, the salient point being whether BTC will be that medium or instead governments will themselves simply get rid of paper and coin currencies and run their own currencies on Blockchain or whatever alternative technology arises.\n\nHeck, even today if JP Morgan sells $1 billion in CDS's to Goldman Sachs, they don't wheel $1 billion in cash across Wall Street between offices, but merely transfer the value electronically. I would wager that ever day the bulk of electronic transactions (electronic transfers and credit cards) already very substantially exceeds the amount of physical cash that changes hands.",
