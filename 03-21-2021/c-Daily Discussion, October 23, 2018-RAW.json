If Musk was typical, there would be no Space X or any of the things he created.\n\nI watched that entire Joe Rogan podcast, and for all the brilliant things that Musk communicated over a long podcast, the media focused on the one second that he held a joint and said he doesn't smoke marijuana because he finds that it interferes with his productivity. If you're easily swayed by media, then I have ice cream in the oven to sell you. It's tastes better that way.",
