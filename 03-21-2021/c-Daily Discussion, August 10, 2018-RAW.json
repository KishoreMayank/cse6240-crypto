Real HODLers don\u2019t talk about a real HODLer, they just HODL. Fake HODLers will brag about HODLing because they are very susceptible to selling. All you HODLers are fake as hell.",

Just because we can justify the over inflated value of stocks by saying that a give company \"could\" increase their earnings or could have an upcoming partnership etc, it doesn't make it any less a form of specualtion.\nI realize this is a different beast and I am the first one to say that comparing Bitcoin to traditional stocks is not logical, but the concept of oversold and baseless prices will find it's way into all investment markets one way or another.",

            "Text": "People bought the rumor and sold the news. \n\nI'm sure some people are playing the futures to try to lower the BTC price; but the volume is just too small to be controlling the BTC price significantly.\n\nBitcoin being the first real digital asset is prone to unsustainable spikes, followed by overcorrections. Its actually a property of Bitcoin and tokens themselves. And here is why:\n\nBitcoin is digitally deliverable globally within 10minute window if so desired. To wrap your head around why this affects the price volatility imagine it as a physical product, like gold, that can be shipped and delivered in any quantity requested within 10minutes of ordering.\n\nWhen other assets are traded you are often exclusively trading paper that represents those products, not the products themselves. In many cases it is impossible to have physical delivery of financial products. The best you can have is an account that shows a balance. You can't withdraw the product; except in the form of dollars. At the end of the day all you can withdraw is fiat currency; so as long as the entity you are trading with provides the fiat you're happy. This gives institutions and platforms a lot of leeway and wiggle room that ends up grossly inflating the number of claims on financial assets, essentially increasing available supply and controlling the price. Since you can never withdraw the financial products themselves there's really no way to know and as long as they are delivery the fiat nobody really cares.\n\nWith Bitcoin individuals can take physical delivery of the product itself, and often do. This causes the supply available for sale to dry up over time. Eventually people catch on and see the price rising to meet limited supply and they buy in too; further reducing the supply. As people withdraw coins from the exchanges and put them in cold storage the exchanges are forced to provide the actual asset. If an exchange has been operating with fractional Bitcoins it is forced to either buy Bitcoins at the market rate somewhere else; thus encouraging further price spikes; or be exposed as fraudulent.\n\nWhen the momentum finally turns around the price overcorrects for the same reason. The supply is flooded due to excessive fear and continual price dropping. Eventually the panic sellers run out of steam and the price can continue a more genuine discovery path.\n\n",

Every time we get down around $6,000 give or take a few hundred bucks it has been holding. If your a noob that thinks technical analysis is down to the dollar I suppose you might feel that the last time was lower but it is still in the same area of support and not only that it did not stay there long. This was the same thing that was going on in 2014 around that 200 to $250 level. There was a final capitulation event for a period of a couple days that went down to a hundred and sixty I think it was early 2015. We may have an event like that going to 4800 or 5000 but it's probably going to be very quick and have a violent turn upwards\n\nI'm definitely not discounting some kind of capitulation event as a lot of people who are looking to buy are just sitting on the sidelines letting the short sellers get on top of each other and do their thing right now. \n\n\nRoughly nine out of ten comments and YouTube videos are bearish right now. I don't think you're going to get sentiment much worse",

Also now that it is $6000 there is no chance for someone to be a multi-millionaire by just buying $1000 worth of bitcoin like in the past. If it goes back up to $18,000 then sure you made a 200% gain but is that the same as the people who bought at $100 and it went to $18,000? Not even close.

Also when talking about crypto currencies.\n\nEspecially when there is a limited supply of coins (like with Bitcoin), it matters a whole lot whether someone can buy up large percentages of the total coins (for whatever reason) for limited amounts of money or if that takes seriously big money.\n\nA currency with a total market cap of just a few million dollars is *much* more susceptible to manipulation and fluctuations than one with a total market cap in the billions of dollars. \n\n>I\u2019m saying that the math of an investment which matters is the percentage returned.\n\n\nYou literally said that \u201cprice per BTC is irellevant\u201d, which is wrong in a number of ways. \n\nWhy do you think that BTC was on every major mainstream news channel after the bull run back in december, but not after any of the previous bull runs? \n\nDon\u2019t be snarky and lecture people if you are not 100% sure that you are correct in what you are lecturing.",

The lustre of how an expensive coin SOUNDS. Then you go on to touch on the ability of a deflationary market to be manipulated.... both which WERENT the topic!\n\nI\u2019m (and was) talking about math. A $20,000 bitcoin might sound more enticing - but again that\u2019s NOT the topic I was discussing with op. I was discussing how the price is irrelevant in terms of an investment - only percentage returned or lost is. \n\nPlus Bitcoin is VERY divisible. We may call it A hundred million Satoshis instead of 1BTC at some point. \n\nYou\u2019re over complicating a very simple fact in an attempt to disprove me and failing at it. \n\nAlso - you must be quite new to this. Because I\u2019m 2014 when BTC touched over $1000 the exact same sentiment was present where people thought the price was LUDICROUS and would never touch 1k again after falling 80%. \n\nIn 5 years if (but most likely when) BTC touches $100,000+ - then crashes back to $20,000 people will say the saaaaaame thing as they have for years now.
