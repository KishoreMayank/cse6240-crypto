Local Bitcoins added segwit and we saw a smaller increase. Trezor switched early and really helped.\n\nI'm patiently waiting for Segwit to pass the 50% milestone, I was sure we would see it by this Halloween...But heck maybe it will be this Christmas.\n\nIs it Mycelium  wallet holding us back? People are switching to Samurai in a big way.\nIs it smaller exchanges that need to upgrade? \n\nI know some wallets like the Bitcoin.com wallet will not upgrade.\n\nIs it expensive for established exchanges or wallets to upgrade to Segwit? Is there a developer group that has made it easier to facilitate upgrading?\n\nIs it strictly just a matter of patience or can we facilitate upgrading. For example dont use Mycelium wallet, Green and Samurai are on the app store and are better anyways.\n\n\nThoughts on Segwit adoption? Any time estimates to break the 50% milestone?\n\n",

At this point, the actual % will no longer be important adoption wise. Much more interesting metric would be to watch LN nodes/channels/services/txs/amounts.\n\nThen, at some point, protocol update would be propossed to discontinue sending to old \"non batchable\" format  because of some technical reason and suddenly nobody would object (or fork as Satoshi's Truest Vision, yada yada) - but it will be a minority.\n\nAfter that, years later you witness a person moving his btc from an old format wallet and it would look like if you see your friend loading a file from a 3.5\" floppy disc in 2018. It would work, but it would be very, very weird.\n\nhope you ejoyed my TED Talk :)\n\n&#x200B;",

And yes I'm excited to see the 50% milestone be reached but it's pretty fair to say the current 44% of transactions on chain being Segwit in just 1 year is a success. \n\nThere was FUD last year saying it would take years to integrate in a meaningful way. But here we are, onchain we can handle way more volume than last year, but IMO more importantly is the 2nd layer networks and then layers built on top of those. When    its seen through that lens I can see that every alternative coin is essentially a  testing ground for what will be adapted to be built on top of 2nd and 3rd layers of the Bitcoin main chain.\n\nI saw a list of wallets and exchanges showing where they were at regarding implementation of Segwit. I'd like to see how its changed over time. I'm still optimistic of 50% by this October 31st....just 6% left to go and we have seen 5% increases in 1 day several times already.",

This masters student is about to spend 24/7 researching, thinking about, writing about, and disseminating all the results about blockchain tech research, all without a monetary incentive (like someone in industry might have). The average person may have spare time to do this, but it would most likely not be a 24/7 gig (unless they were a blockchain developer, but then they would be monetarily incentivized to focus on certain blockchain aspects because they need to get paid to work).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis reminds me of the geology community, where you have academics and industry people- both do research, both have pros and cons to their research, Industry has more money and many intersecting disciplines, but are more secret and less peer reviewed, academics have less money and time, can be more isolated in their overlap with other sciences, but do high quality peer reviewed studies, they disseminate all their research (because that's their monetary incentive (have to publish to get grants and get grants to publish), they teach new students, and they teach fundamentals. Over time industry and academic circles intersect at conferences and meetings, which leads to new collaborations between industry and academic institutions, which leads to more innovations and ideas. I think its a good thing.",

They are still buying it.\n\nNow, US has probably (can't be arsed to search, sorry) highest capital alocation per individual. Means 6k is 1 month's salary for many people. when the price will go to 50k, 'regular' people in US will realize that they can never have one full bitcoin. If this is socially accepted (you are not a loser if you have less than 1 btc), it would fly past 100k in a massive hype and FUD from the social group of people owning most of the world's legacy capital. That should be such a massive shift that the richest 10% would have to start acting and bam! it's done.",

            "Text": "You might be right. But the same could be said about any speculative asset, like gold. But gold also largely functions as a store of value. I\u2019m not sure if bitcoin prices can remain elevated long term, but once institutions enter there\u2019s a high probability we\u2019re going to see another parabolic move like in 2017. Like many of the bulls say, over the long run prices will depend on adoption. Demand (and price) should remain high once the bitcoin economy is widespread and strong enough for the masses to want in. It\u2019s the strength and attractiveness of the network that will drive long term adoption. Sorry to quote Warren Buffett here, but he says that price is what you pay and value is what you get. What do you get with bitcoin? I believe the thinking is that long term, you will \u201cget\u201d the ability to participate in a global, decentralized economic ecosystem with a certain level of stability, security, and autonomy that no government can guarantee. Might be a pipe dream, but that seems to be the vision. You can also consider why someone might trade yuan for dollars. Dollars have a price relative to yuan, but the purchaser of those dollars gets something in return, namely the ability to participate in an economy denominated in dollars. The hope with bitcoin is that there will be an entire global economy denominated in bitcoin, which will provide justification for giving up fiat to receive bitcoin. ",

            "Text": "the pattern of volatility will be affected with the amount of new users added to the network in coming hype period. 2017 is when media started to pay attention. Single article about a country banning btc moved the price. Single big firm press conference had a massive impact. Then in Q1 2018 when 'everybody' was jumping ship, there were not many people around to tell you. This time we will have 2017 survivors.\n\nI think we are going to see a very strong network effect this very cycle (Q4 2018 - Q12019) and things will be very different from now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - bitcoin will not volatile forever, adoption is not going to be linear.",
