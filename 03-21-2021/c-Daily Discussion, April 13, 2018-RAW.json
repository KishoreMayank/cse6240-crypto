            "Text": "One thing I have not seen much of here, is discussion about BTC derivatives.  The turning point for BTC, as I see it, was when the authorities approved BTC for derivative trading in December 2017 (link below).  Unfortunately, and fortunately for some, this gave speculators the ability to sell BTC without holding a single coin (also known as short selling).  This happens in stock markets all the time where the price is driven down not by the lack of buyers, but due to the sheer volume of derivative sellers.  You can easily find those stocks that are heavily shorted and it ultimately puts pressure on the sell side driving the price down further.\n\nWe are now in April 2018 and BTC is trading at 40% of its all time high.  This is not due to lack of buyers IMHO but simply due to the volume of sellers, specifically on the derivative platform.  Think about it, what better way to make money other than sell an asset that is trading at an all time high as there is large potential for a massive sell off.  This is why we have seen massive sell offs with BTC after periods of large gains such as, $19.5k, $17k and $11k. \n\nSo the price of BTC is largely driven by the volume of short sellers, not the volume of long term buyers (eg; Hodlers).  Now my thoughts are that sellers are running out of steam and there is largely more upside at current prices than there is downside, this could mark a significant change in sentiment.  Not to disregard that prices have also somewhat plateaued around the 6000-6500 mark.\n\nThis is either a turning point where those derivative sellers become buyers, or continue to sell knowing that the lower the price goes the more risk there is of potential upside and that short trade being stopped out.  Sideways trading is always a good signal that sentiment may be shifting and yes we had some sideways trading recently (31 March to 11 April) which was followed by a large swing upwards. Long, boring periods of sideways trading is what BTC needs people, the more this occurs the greater the potential for upside and the greater the potential for a return of the bull market that we all are eagerly awaiting. \n\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/us-approves-bitcoin-derivatives-trading-on-major-exchanges/a-41626578\n",

Earlier the price was $8200 with 6000 users here then it went to 11000 and the price fell to $7800 in 15 minutes. \nIt was the exact same when it went from 12k to $6k and every other time between. You\u2019ll also notice a massive spike in users with fresh accounts under 1 month start active posts or comments that try and create fear or attempt to shit on other users for asking questions. It\u2019s as if a massive group of people are actively trying to manipulate the current price or Bitcoin. Who coulda seen that coming... ",

Everyone says lambos, I buy, and then it crashes $600.

But bitcoin is controled by the people, we dont realize if we hold that drives up the price, but the whales who own the majority of the bitcoin know that they can control the people (not bitcoin). So they sell a bunch of bitcoin at once which drives down the price and at the same time while the price is crashing they buy more bitcoin. So when the people who are afraid of losing more money sell their coins the whales buy them all up, and when there are no more weak hands to sell the whales start to drive up the price because they bought the coins at a discount and they need to sell the coins. If you want to get rich like a whale you have to think like a whale.   ",

As I pointed out to someone else, sometimes people just buy shit. Or sell shit. \n\nTA is worthless, but not because of manipulation. It's worthless because it comes from an era where people read charts with pencils and rulers.

It's fine to buy now, as long as you don't put everything in during the climb (and it was good if you had a chance to buy the dip too). I feel that it's best to buy in stages. The more volume, the harder it is for whales to create greater volatility, but I agree that whales often like it when people react quickly or predictably.",

Even if it goes up and you miss another opportunity there is still so much room for Bitcoin to grow. But short term it could definitely fall back down.

Imagine you went to purchase a car and had absolutely no idea what an engine, wheels, and steel or aluminum were.  That is where you are right now.  Take some time and do some research. Get into the market when you are informed and you will be much happier. To make another analogy, It's like playing an instrument. The first time you pick it up you will be laughably terrible, but if you keep at it you will get a little better every day.  You need to learn how to play a few songs before you start writing your own. ",
