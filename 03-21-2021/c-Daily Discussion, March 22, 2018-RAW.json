Everyone on here has been wrong, and everyone on here has been right, and nobody knows when they're being which (including myself).\n\nI'm divining (as a game) that it will hit like $5,700 this drop (like some BTC rich maniac is laughing his ass off while scaring the shit out of everyone). But, I bought in at 8.5k, plan on buying at 8k, and lower. Because frankly, I don't see this dying. *I do* see the market being erratic as fuck, but it's part of what I love about Bitcoin right now.",

            "Text": "Regarding tax selling:\n\nAs tax deadline approaches people will undoubtedly launch a new class of FUD missile , \"the tax sell dump\".\n\nI remember this from the 2001 crash on Yahoo stock message boards.  \n\nMarch 2001 saw some pretty steep drops  but the actual tax day was rather uneventful as I remember.\n\nI had two friends caught in the tax trap in 2001,  NEITHER of them payed the taxes they owed on April 15.  Both chose to take the penalty,  and pay the interest thinking their stocks would recover.  They actually did somewhat,  but never enough to get them in the money.  Both sold when the market was better, but both sold down way more than 50%.\n\nSo be prepared for a longer lasting 'tax hangover',  I think it may be easy to do some math because the interest rates on unpaid taxes are known.  I actually think the tax selling effect will be MORE sever than it was in 2000 & 2001.  The NASDAQ bubble started popping early in the year 2000, plenty of time to react properly and learn about taxes.   The crypto bubble started popping right at the holiday season,  everybody was distracted.  I have a gut feel there are a lot of people stuck in a tax trap,  and a far more sever one due to percentages of rise and fall of crypto bubble compared to Internet bubble.\n\ngood luck!\n",

It has been confirmed that customer assets are useful for private purposes. It was the first time that Japan imposed direct sanctions on the cryptographic exchange.\n\n\nSource: http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/03/22/2018032203367.html",

I'm super excited about it and really want to know what people think of it. Apologies in advance if this wasn't the right place to post it.\n\n \n\nMost people trying to predict prices are doing technical analysis by hand (measuring candles, checking resistance lines, applying fibonacci, etc.) and some of them are getting decent results. Wall Street does TA with bots for their algorithmic trading, which is faster and more reliable, so we made our own TA bot.\n\n \n\nWe combined our TA bot with a machine learning algorithm to understand how the news and other IRL events such as financial markets affect the price of bitcoin. So far we've been doing great.\n\n \n\nThe tool has been around 80% accurate on the couple of months we've been developing it so it's been fun to say the least haha.\n\n \n\nIf anyone wants to check it out or just have a conversation about what we've made, price prediction or trading, HMU or check us out at www.hodlorshort.com\n\nOr check our Product Hunt",

            "Text": "Self trivia: I was in a deep drag last year; a HS buddy started asking me about bitcoin and for a reason I decided to buy. 20$ (lel). I gradually increased. Lost 50% (thanks Jan) and decided to stop it all. Of course I didn't, but I didn't increase capital. I decided to scalp semi smart. Made a good run to recover 20%. Then stupidity took them away. then the 8k drop happened.. I couldn't resist to try more leverage now that I knew more. So here I am, still monitoring graphs.. which is dead stupid, but all excited by the pseudo-gambling of coins.. and instead of doing nothing, I take advantage of the excitement to work out a little while waiting for tipping points. I started programming a bot (2% done though), learned to fix electronics and read a book about swing trading, while going into quant.\n\nThis soulless addiction made me 200% more lively...",

            "Text": "Scary. I left stocks a long time ago knowing that they are fully manipulated to finish off the rich and poor game they have going on. The rich don't like the middle class. Bye 401k! Bye money! I was totally wrong though and thought it would dump years ago but the federal reserve can print trillions of dollars whenever it wants and has  been keeping it up. Companies I loved when I was a kid going under every few months. Toys R US is closing all it's stores so another couple hundred K people on food stamps but the economy is booming according to the DOW. I think we will end up living through the next great depression in our lifetime. Really sucks then WW III. After the 2000 crash then 2008 crash we are well overdue for a massive crash. I don't see the Dow being worth more then 6k right now. Nothing Justifies it. Good thing if you own a home the housing prices will rocket. I'm going to take profit this time around and live in a damn tent if I have to. The rich move around from game to game. We are just squirrels in the game trying to find a nut. It's their game and they will never lose but we can get that nut every once in awhile. Just hope when the Dow fully crashes they will move to the new market which is crypto. The ones that survive that is. You just have to love people calling crypto a bubble when the marketcap is around 330 billion and around 70 trillion has been pumped in to other markets in the past 10 years. That's the depression bubble. Where did this money come from? Printed by the federal reserve. Imagine being able to just print money.. Again what could go wrong in the end lol. Wish you the best when the world economy crashes. ",

It started with just teaching our machine learning algorithm how to do technical analysis, changing or adding techniques to improve the accuracy of each prediction against past outcomes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point we started running our predictions against real time outcomes and improving until TA got us close to 65% accuracy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen we started adding markers from everywhere we could think of. We have data feeds from every stock exchange and financial market in the world, from every news outlet we could find, every bitcoin related website, twitter. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe added each marker and measured how it affected the accuracy of each prediction, tweaking things around. We'd improve by 0.5% to 1% every day, nowadays it's way harder to make improvements, but we're still tweaking as much as we can.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think at this point we're consuming more computing power on AWS than if were just running a mining operation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday we're hitting around 80% accuracy (sometimes a little under, sometimes a little over) and it's been good. We cover our expenses but like I said in another reply, we don't have the capital to turn this into a large scale trading rig yet, the money we have for trading is compounding nicely, but we're not close to \"millions\" yet xD",

            "Text": "Short term speculative trading increases noise and volatility. Using BTC to purchase goods and services is effectively short term trading as vendors will simply sell the BTC immediately for fiat currency which they need to pay their employees, taxes, and effectively run their business. Selling BTC in such a low liquidity market drives down price. You can argue that this encourages more vendors to accept BTC but the fact is BTC is simply not ready to be used as a currency yet so these transactions harm BTC.\n\nYou first need stability before it can be used effectively as a currency. Without widespread adoption, you can\u2019t have stability, thus it fails as a currency. People who believe it needs to be used as a currency before widespread adoption can happen are putting the cart before the horse. It must be invested in by the masses to find a stable price point and minimize volatility before it will be used as a currency.",
