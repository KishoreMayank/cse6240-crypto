            "Text": "From a September article being republishes as a \"told you so\":  \" In this scenario, we have tapped the 5.8k support level multiple times now. The average retail trader has likely longed 5.8k-6k and placed a stop below, in case we do break this support. This means that there is tons of liquidity below the 5.8k level that has not been tapped yet. Why is this important? When larger players (think institutions) need to fill their massive orders, they need to target areas that have lots of liquidity to avoid price moving up on them while they are trying to accumulate. Since there are plenty of stop sells below the 5.8k support level the larger players know that if price makes it into this range it will trigger a stop run and those retail positions will auto-sell en masse, filling the pockets of the larger players with the least amount of slippage. If this really is near the bottom, the larger players will likely push price below 5.8k one last time to fill their positions before we head up for the next wave. \" [https://medium.com/@crediblecryptolive/why-we-havent-hit-the-bitcoin-bear-market-bottom-yet-and-what-to-look-for-as-an-entry-signal-5e8073ca11d2](https://medium.com/@crediblecryptolive/why-we-havent-hit-the-bitcoin-bear-market-bottom-yet-and-what-to-look-for-as-an-entry-signal-5e8073ca11d2)\n\n&#x200B;",

Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!

I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.

            "Text": "This is my view of the current bear market. It is highly speculative, and therefore should be seen more as a sci-fi narrative rather than actual reality.\n\nI think we all agree that the first part of the bear market, which corresponds to the $20k-$6k move, was completely organic. It is to be expected that big and not-so-big players started to realize gains after an insane run. The market needed to cool down a bit, and go back to focusing in tech rather than price mania.\n\nA few weeks ago, however, $6k fell after some weeks or months of ranging, which gave the impression of it being the bottom. BCH/BSV hashwar started, and both sides needed to defend their position (BSV attacks, BCH defends), having to burn lots of reserves to this effect. It is known that involved players' pockets are deep enough to cause such controversy in the market, which is concerning.\n\nAnd this is where the sci-fi kicks in. It would not be unthinkable to imagine that big companies such as Samsung or Intel could be backing BSV's side. They have expressed in the media their desire to get in the ASIC mining market (see examples such as [https://bitcoinist.com/squire-samsung-asic-bitcoin-mining-chip/](https://bitcoinist.com/squire-samsung-asic-bitcoin-mining-chip/) for Samsung, or [https://www.coindesk.com/intel-just-won-a-patent-for-an-energy-efficient-bitcoin-miner](https://www.coindesk.com/intel-just-won-a-patent-for-an-energy-efficient-bitcoin-miner) for Intel).\n\nThe biggest producer of ASIC miners, today, is Bitmain, who is well known as one of the key players of BCH. Apparently, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductors) is one of their main suppliers, who is at the same time a competitor of Samsung and Intel in the semiconductors industry. It would be much smoother for these new players, who as far as I know have no market share in the ASIC mining industry, if Bitmain and TSMC were out of the equation. Especially when Bitmain has also been growing massively in other fields such as AI, which is a strategic one, where the big Nvidia, Intel and AMD also excel ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-17/china-s-crypto-chips-king-sets-his-sights-on-ai](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-17/china-s-crypto-chips-king-sets-his-sights-on-ai)).\n\nThere are rumours affirming that Bitmain has attracted a sizeable debt with TSMC (over $1B, but most of it seems to have been paid and current debt would be estimated in $300M), and is at the risk of losing TSMC as a supplier, which would compromise everything. Bitmain is one of their top 10 customers, generating a representative chunk of TSMC's revenue.\n\nI would believe that Bitmain is the target, and negative price action is the mean to neutralizing that target. When Bitmain released their financials because of the IPO, someone could realize that their weakest point would be the large stash of BCH they were holding. Dumping coins massively, and at a high rate, would constrain their position:\n\n\\- Altcoins, the biggest losers, lose interest. It is not profitable to mine them anymore, so they become insecure (see Vertcoin's 51% attack a few days ago). Miners go back to mining either ETH (non-ASIC miners) or BTC (ASIC miners).\n\n\\- No new investments in mining equipment. It is almost not even profitable to mine BTC anymore in most countries, so basically big manufacturers such as Bitmain cannot make money selling, and have a big stock collecting dust. It is hardware that will deprecate soon.\n\n\\- If manufacturers cannot sell their equipment (no income via sales), and also the value of current coins decrease (no gains via coin appreciation), they cannot invest in R&D, basically putting them behind of new players in the market who have not been affected by this meltdown (ie Samsung and Intel. In fact, Bitmain is closing down their operation in Israel, mainly focused in R&D, this week.\n\nOnce BTC and BCH price got to a point (low enough) where it is suspected that Bitmain would not be able sustain their operations (mining and retail), a small mining firm, UnitedCorp, probably related to BSV's team somehow, filed a suit against Bitmain (and Roger Ver (BCH), Jihan Wu (Bitmain, BCH), [Bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com/) (Roger Ver) and Kraken exchange (Roger Ver is an investor). I am unsure how the legal system works in this regard, but I suppose having a legal procedure open could mean restrictions in terms of cash flow or financing operations BCH supporters could need to bring back the price to a point which is sustainable for them, in order to resume ASIC miners sales and be able to mine coins profitably. Bitmain was trying to do an IPO ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-26/crypto-billionaires-open-their-books-with-bitmain-ipo-filing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-26/crypto-billionaires-open-their-books-with-bitmain-ipo-filing)) and Kraken is trying to sell part of his business ([https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/breaking-kraken-preparing-a-private-sale-at-4b-valuation/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/breaking-kraken-preparing-a-private-sale-at-4b-valuation/)). It could be related.\n\nSo, in my view, this is all a shakeout to replace the king in the industry, Bitmain, so a new oligopoly in the mining industry can be established. A coup d'\u00eatat. And when Bitmain goes out of business, if it does, the normal operation of the market may resume. I think current price action is trying to choke Bitmain slowly, and margin speculators and altcoins are collateral damage. The market needed a purge anyway. Bitmain is now bleeding money, they owe a lot, and they could potentially be cut off - they are not in a good condition, and they do not seem to have the resources to keep fighting this war. Someone could think the Chinese government could intervene, being Bitmain progressing well in strategic sectors such as AI or having control of the ASIC mining production supply. Who knows.\n\nRemember the news I linked at the beginning of the post in relation to Samsung becoming the manufacturer (as in adopting TSMC's position in relation to Bitmain) of Squire Mining? Yesterday, Squire Mining established his advisory board ([https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/12/1666168/0/en/Squire-Establishes-Advisory-Board.html](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/12/1666168/0/en/Squire-Establishes-Advisory-Board.html)), and guess who the two inaugural members are: Craig Wright and Jimmy Nguyen, both of them from nChain, the company behind BSV. Someone could think Squire Mining wants to take Bitmain's spot, and Samsung as their ally. Craig Wright also repeatedly wrote on his Twitter feed about how many patents his team has filed, and I suspect they could be well related to the mining industry, to lock Squire Mining's position in the market once they dethrone Bitmain. I think Bitmain is about to release his AntMiner S15 in a few days, which uses 7nm technology from TSMC, and Samsung is expected to release a 10nm one during Q2019. But who is going to buy those S15's in the current market environment?\n\nThis is probably all bullshit, far-fetched and overthought, but there are way too many coincidences. At least we could have a new meme to talk about to justify market movements, lol. Probably the whole ecosystem is still very overvalued given its current practical utility and this bear market is just organic.\n\nWhat do you think about this fiction?",

People actually dump bcash after realising it is essentially a scam coin.\n\nA Bcasher doesn't realise that transacting for a cup of coffee is most efficiently processed and done off-chain (lightning). On-chain scaling will and must eventually halt at a point because not many people will be able to run full node for decentralization. It's only via off chain scaling that bitcoin can be adopted by mass. Talking about buying coffee, we'll have off-chain settlement like bakkt/starbucks soon that would crush bcash empty highway by tons of magnitude fold. Lightning will crush bcash 128mb block by light years.\n\nA Bcasher will always claim their coin is bitcoin by arguing their coin is more align to the whitepaper. But the truth is, bcash itself violate the fundamentals of the whitepaper with its Dda and tokenisation of the coin. Wormhole token pushed by jihan? Bcasher only call their coin as bitcoin because of marketing so they can dump their coins.

Remember that typically, Bitcoin's bear market lows are usually only no higher than twice the previous cycle's peak. That may sound bleak, since the previous cycle peak was only 1100ish. BUT ... keeping that in mind, imagine 20k being the next cycle's 'low'. Does that make waiting up to 4 or 5 years worth it? Now it could take a year or 5 years, NOBODY knows.

I think sidechains might fill this role at some point.  There will likely be some tradeoffs in decentralization or security unfortunately.  The benefit is that you could have massively greater scale when you're using a number of sidechains which 'settle' in BTC.  Lightning can run on top of these, and lightning nodes could conceivably bridge between sidechains or from a sidechain to the bitcoin chain.  I'm not aware of other scaling efforts at the moment, although segwit and LN should get us quite a bit of mileage before it's a pressing issue.\n\nIf you're interested in sidechains, I think drivechain was the first implementation.

There tops and there are bottoms. They are connected to fatigue of buying and selling. It would be foolish to think Bitcoin could have kept going up forever, and just as foolish to think it can keep going down forever. People like investing when the prices are beat up and selling when they are high. It's basic market psyscology.",

I should have mentioned Schnorr signatures, which will reduce transactions sizes and make multisig transactions the same size as a normal transation.  Still, this only goes so far, increasing capacity by something like 40% if I recall (and allow us to fit even more 2-of-2 transactions).  We still need massive scaling though, and that's where I think sidechains coupled with lightning might provide a solution.",

The most bearish analysts out there, even Bloomberg's McGlone expects another ath as bitcoin continues its growth into products, on-ramps and advanced exchanges in the growing crypto market.

It's a huge market and only the brain dead would expect this to go away.\nPeople would have bet their right arm it would never hit 20k and they'd bet their left arm that it would never drop below 5k again. They'd be armless now. Ignore that shit man, it's going to be up and down long after we're dead of old age. Don't be among the people trying to pretend you know it's going to stop.

You are contradicting your own perspective. You are absolutely correct, what Bitcoin has been doing this past decade is slowly emerging. But currency being of the nature that it is, embedded so deeply into the fabric of society, will take generations to change shape. Ten years is a drop in the bucket. That bitcoin is happening is hardly debatable because it's already happening! The only thing debatable is the market ups and downs.",

You're almost guaranteed to lose 80%+ of your investment with a drop down to 4000$.

Every time bitcoin goes up it crashes by like 80%.  If you're buying in when bitcoin is at high prices you're almost certainly going to lose money.    Last year we were in uncharted territory so you could get some people on board due to FOMO or all those \"thanksgiving dinner\" discussions or \"bitcoins for christmas\".  You had people hyping it all over the place and \"normies\" were getting into it.   Most people didn't expect the price to tank so fast.  I think it's going to be extremely difficult to convince people to buy-in again, or attract new buyers.\n\nTo move the price up that much you need a lot of people willing to buy at high prices, and thus those people need to be convinced that bitcoin will remain at a high price and go up from there.   When bitcoin is rubberbanding all the time you can't have any confidence in its stability and it will scare off buyers.  All thats left is currency manipulators and you're really rolling the dice with them.",

Corporate stock valuations are based on revenue projections and are backed up by economic activity.   Bitcoins value is based entirely on speculation at the moment.\n\nIf bitcoin was a regular stock it would be a prime target for bain capital and the like to come in and liquidate the company.  It only survives at all now because it's so different from a stock.   I don't think you can draw a neat comparison between the two.\n\nIf you really want to buy low on a speculative currency you can get a zillion venezuelan bolivars for only a few dollars USD right now.   How much lower can it possibly go?   Seriously, they have so much oil that their economy could immediately rebound with some competent leadership.\n\nI don't think bitcoin will reach its ATH of 20k ever again, just because it's too risky to buy bitcoins at that price.   Even retail investors will be scared away from high priced bitcoins due to its proclivity for crashing.   You would have to be absolutely convinced that \"this time it will be different\" and I don't think anyone has that kind of confidence in bitcoin, at least not anyone with enough money to move the needle.",

However, yes it does take out a lot of people in the process. \n\nA 2.5% dividend is a nice little present, but not to be confused as nearly as valuable as the underlying asset. It's mostly to give investors some cash flow and the dividend usually comes out of the value of the company in a lot of cases.   \nShit, cryptocurrencies like NEO pay out a dividend in GAS but that doesn't make it game-changing.   \nThe problem with Venezuelan bolivar is I don't believe in the underlying asset. A change of control would likely lead to a new currency. Cryptocurrency I do believe in the speculative asset. To give you another example, If the Singapore dollar crashed tomorrow by 90% I would buy into it, yes. \n\nYou're saying the asset class will never be anything more than a very very small retail speculative commodity.

Something like 300$ bitcoins with only a +/- 50$ deviation for a year would be great for bitcoins adoption and confidence.  As it is it cant be used for anything other than speculation at the moment.\n\nAlso honestly I think there are better coins out there, bitcoin is just the first one but it's so technologically limited it should be supplanted by something thats more scalable in the long term.

That is how the US regulators see it and categorize it, as a commodity.   \nBeing a competitor as a payment method against Paypal/Venmo/Visa is secondary. \n\nIt has most if not all of the functions of precious metals with some obvious advantages. Or else we'd be buying into a stablecoin, which is not what we are here for. We are here for an asset that is not correlated with the rest of the markets, something that governments can't easily control. Which is all more store of value than payments. Yes I want to be able to spend it, as we all do, but the core is really the store of value. Or else I should just charge up my venmo account. \n\nHypothetically, having some sort of bitcoin debit card that is accepted like Visa would solve the issue so we wouldn't need individual businesses to start agreeing to accept it it and merchants can on their end immediately receive it as local currency. Again, pace of innovation is part of what I'm buying into to supplement the speculative store of value.\n\nI don't think bitcoin being 300 or 50,000 is really a large deterrent, it's a psychological barrier. Like I said earlier, the price going up at this point should increase adoption more than it going down. It doesn't change anything, nor does it change the potential upside depending on where we are with innovation. \n\nWhen bitcoin went from $1200 down to the low $200s I'm sure there were people in the same situation as you saying we need to see a return down to the two figure range to get more adoption and the risk/reward ratio yada yada. \n\nI don't mean to be condescending I see where you are getting at I just don't buy it.\n\nWe can't get significantly more adoption in the future and have prices go down to 3 figures.
