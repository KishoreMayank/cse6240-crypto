Both employ some moderators/arbitrage system for the conflicts to be resolved. Localbitcoins run on the web, bisq runs on desktop software, which in my opinion makes bisq slightly more vulnerable. Both networks utilize the trust buildup with successful trades - a way to introduce some degree trustlessness in fiat world, so first you can trade small and it increases over time. In localbitcoins you can arrange to meet live and trade for cash which you can't in bisq. Also in bisq you have some limitations like you can't add multicurrency accounts.",

These documents show that Bitmain are massively invested in, and exposed to, a discredited coin that is falling in value, and whose price has been artificially supported by them for months.\n\nThey are desperately trying to sustain it at about 0.09 now.  Meanwhile Ver is advising his followers that this low price is a great time to buy - oh yeah - ok.\n\nWhat should the miners do?  Slowly release it whilst trying to hold 0.09 and lose a fortune?\n\nOr dump it and cause a Bcash crash and also lose a fortune?\n\nThat coin is on a knife edge.  And I am not sorry to say that they deserve it. ",
