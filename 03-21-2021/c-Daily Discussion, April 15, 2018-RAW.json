I\u2019ve been with bitcoin and crypto since 2013 and honestly believe in the tech. Sadly though I didn\u2019t pull all my investments in January and I\u2019ve been at the mercy of this market since then. It makes me weary of this bull run. I want it to keep climbing with stable numbers but I feel a bear trap is coming. I\u2019m not sure who or what group is doing these market moves. I\u2019ve heard more and more accounts of closed off investor groups manipulating prices and banking profits on our pain. We need to fucking fight these assholes. This is our future and our livelihood. I\u2019ve also been day drinking.",

            "Text": "Married with 2 kids combined income of 200k a year. About 530AM EST on Thursday morning  I invested into 1.4 BTC because it looked like it was going to jump and I figured afterwards I would exchange it all for Kin when it was at rock bottom I lost internet service for next 8 hours being in the mountains of Appalachia. When I got back into service I seen it jumped  way more than I ever could have ever imagined literally minutes after I invested. I'm still invested. I called a bull run 2 days before this as well seems as though that prediction was right as well.... I hope everyone here makes all the money they can because this is probably going to last until June...purely speculation though. Good luck all!",

Some of the comments I read here today sound a bit odd.\n\nAgain, last years bull market lasted the whole year and there is no reason to believe the bear market is done in 3 month. Unless you don't believe there was a bear market to start with, of course, just a correction down from the peak.\n\nWell I believe there was a bear market, there is a bear market, and this run maybe will go high over the next few weeks, maybe break 10k, I don't know. But I am convinced at the end it's <7k again. And from there... who knows.\n\nSorry. It's my opinion. I might be wrong, but be careful with your money. If you think it's time to invest, don't invest more than you think you can wait several years for to take profit. And don't invest what you can't afford to lose.",

It's just that big players are trading the markets at the moment with different viewpoints on where the prices of the crypto's are going to go. Every time an previous resistance is broken there's just an over demand because the one that believe the prices will go up are then buying aggressively because they think this really is a good opportunity to buy while it's still possible while at the same time the shorters are closing their positions because they can't handle the losses anymore or are changing their viewpoint on basis of the recent price development. Just my point of view. Expecting a change in sentiment to go slow and gradually is just not how these markets work.",

Being disabled (hence the age because it progresses with age) - I hate that i'm dependant on others so I think subconsciously I try to \"repay my debt\". Everything I do is not good enough for me. I have been tracking Bitcoin since practically its start but managed to overcome my \"inner voice\" only by the end of the last year (yeah I know ..) when my friend gave me courage. I waned some independence but now if it takes off again or it drops I lose. Probably the healthy thing would be to ignore the charts and go on with my life but it is starting to become more difficult (because it is interesting not even from investment standpoint but everything else). Stupid but perhaps I waned to vent where no one knows me.",

Whereas the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
