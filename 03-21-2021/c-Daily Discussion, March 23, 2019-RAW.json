He believes the FED should act more like the GAO not be completely private and more accountable. The Fed has to be more like the GAO. \n\nPrivate banks shouldn\u2019t be able to shock the economy by raising interest rates overnight to benefit a small rich minority. People love Bitcoin\u2019s model cause you can plan its supply by the block rewards reduction every four years so you can plan your financial security for 20,30,60,100 years. No surprises in bitcoin. \n\nPlus the USA government works for the people. They should lend money at zero % and not be benefiting off its citizens. Other countries without central banks, did that and the economy grew. The central banks hated it. \n\nStephen Moore is the warning shot the FED needs. Look at the USA\u2019s GAO. Similar charter but they don\u2019t profit off it.",

It\u2019s just twitter replies with an extra sprinkle of r/iamverysmart mixed in. \n\nBut it is entertaining to see how many people insist that they\u2019re right. I like crypto as much as the next guy and I think it\u2019s a great idea with immense value. But I\u2019m not delusional enough to proclaim that to be an absolute truth. These other commenters have an insane level of arrogance to think they\u2019ve been proven correct by one article. You can\u2019t debate with people like that, you can barely interact with them. ",

So that cant be the reason to decide 1/2MB is ok forever.\n\ncan you give a clear answer to that question: do you get paid to write this?\n\nreasonable? how is it reasonable when fees were dozen of dollars and transaction times days with less than 1% of people involved? Companies like steam and microsoft stopped accepting bitcoin because of that.\n\nchosen by everyone? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZp7UGgBR0I (2013) see like/dislike ratio and comments. Majority against this small blocks. +there is clear evidence that heavy censorship on other platforms led to \"most people in favour\".\n\nThats enough already but if on top of that noone can give a good answer to my questions its pretty obvious in my opinion that everyone here talking like you is a shill (or repeating stuff he has no clue about) and BTC-Bitcoin became a huge joke.",
