Perhaps this pump has something to do with the news report (below) that illustrates a softening at the SEC to the possibility of approving the first ever Bitcoin ETF.  If this happens it would open the floodgates to casual investors to get a piece of the crypto pie, which will likely send bitcoin soaring. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel very strongly that 2019 is the year to buy as much bitcoin as you possibly can.  That's my plan anyway.  With the block reward halvening set to occur in May 2020, that alone could spark the next bull run.  A bitcoin ETF combined with the halvening would quickly send us to the moon.\n\n&nbsp;  \n\nCongratulations to all the hodlers for toughing it out this long.  I am with you.  We will get through this bear market together and hopefully, one day, celebrate together.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll the best,\n\nThe-Physicist\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SEC Commissioner Says Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved \u2018Eventually\u2019**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> A commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will ultimately be approved.  Robert J. Jackson Jr., in an interview published by government-focused news source Roll Call on Wednesday, said:\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>\u201cEventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we\u2019ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so.\u201d\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>Another SEC commissioner has been even more pragmatic over the possibility of a bitcoin ETF. Back in July, Hester Peirce said that the Winklevoss\u2019 proposed rule change \u201csatisfies the statutory standard and that we should permit BZX to list and trade this bitcoin-based exchange-traded product (\u2018ETP\u2019).\u201d\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>\u201cFrom my perspective, we need to be mindful of what our role is, and it\u2019s not to be the ones who decide which innovations and which technologies get through and which ones don\u2019t,\u201d Peirce told CoinDesk soon after.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>Today, Peirce tweeted that she looks forward to working with Jackson \u201cto open the doors to innovation.\u201d\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>The SEC\u2019s rejections have clearly not deterred all from trying to make the ETF breakthrough.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>Last month, due to the U.S. government shutdown, Cbeo withdrew its proposed rule change that, if approved, would clear the way for a bitcoin ETF backed by VanEck and SolidX. Days later it refiled.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>Also in January, Bitwise Asset Management announced its plan to launch a bitcoin ETF.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/sec-commissioner-says-bitcoin-etf-will-be-approved-eventually\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[\\- Hopium Time Archives -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ahgcn6/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet_for_the_vets_to/)",

Jackson Jr., in an interview published by government-focused news source Roll Call on Wednesday, [said](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/the-future-holds-cryptocurrency-based-funds-says-secs-jackson):\n\n>\u201cEventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we\u2019ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so.\u201d\n\nA number of bitcoin ETF proposals have filed for SEC approval, but none has yet got the green light.\n\nJay Clayton, chairman of the SEC) has [said](https://www.coindesk.com/clayton-sec-ico-funding-security-offering) he doesn\u2019t see a pathway to a cryptocurrency ETF approval until concerns over market manipulation are addressed.\n\nThe SEC has to date\u00a0rejected at least 10 such proposals. Last August, it [turned down](https://www.coindesk.com/sec-rejects-7-bitcoin-etf-proposals)\u00a0seven filings from ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares. A day later, though, the regulator said it [would review](https://www.coindesk.com/sec-says-it-will-review-bitcoin-etf-rejections) the proposals.\n\nIn July, the SEC for the second time [rejected](https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-brothers-bitcoin-etf-rejected-by-sec-for-second-time)\u00a0Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss\u2019 proposal to list a bitcoin ETF on the Bats BZX Exchange.\n\nDiscussing the Winklevoss\u2019 proposal with Roll Call, Jackson said it was \u201cnot a difficult case,\u201d but the risk of manipulation and harm to investors was \u201cenormous,\u201d while the market has a \u201cvery serious\u201d liquidity problem.\n\nHe continued:\n\n>\u201cI\u2019m happy to say market participants have begun to come in with ideas. Whether or not we\u2019re going to find one that really protects investors I don\u2019t know, but I do know that that \\[Winklevoss\\] case wasn\u2019t especially close.\u201d\n\nAnother SEC commissioner has been even more pragmatic over the possibility of a bitcoin ETF. Back in July, Hester Peirce [said](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-dissent-34-83723#.W1o-36vBMDU.twitter) that the Winklevoss\u2019 proposed rule change \u201csatisfies the statutory standard and that we should permit BZX to list and trade this bitcoin-based exchange-traded product (\u2018ETP\u2019).\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, we need to be mindful of what our role is, and it\u2019s not to\u00a0be the ones who decide which innovations and which technologies get through\u00a0and which ones don\u2019t,\u201d Peirce [told](https://www.coindesk.com/the-secs-hester-peirce-isnt-a-bitcoin-champion-just-a-regulation-realist) CoinDesk soon after.\n\nToday, Peirce\u00a0[tweeted](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1093604854709264384?s=20) that she looks forward to working with Jackson \u201cto open the doors to innovation.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rejections have clearly not deterred all from trying to make the ETF breakthrough.\n\nLast month, due to the U.S. government shutdown, Cbeo [withdrew](https://www.coindesk.com/cboe-withdraws-proposal-for-vaneck-solidx-bitcoin-etf) its\u00a0proposed rule change that, if approved, would clear the way for a bitcoin ETF backed by VanEck and SolidX. Days later it [refiled](https://www.coindesk.com/cboe-re-files-vaneck-solidx-bitcoin-etf-proposal).\n\nAlso in January, Bitwise Asset Management [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/nyse-arca-files-paperwork-for-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-approval) its plan to launch a bitcoin ETF.",
