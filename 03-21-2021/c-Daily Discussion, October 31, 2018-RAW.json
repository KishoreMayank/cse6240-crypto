Once economic recession kicks in, you'll see people searching for alternative ways to invest.

Are the world's reserve banks going to suddenly stop printing money and return to sound economic policy?  Is hyperinflation in troubled economies going to suddenly stop due to the benevolence of their leadership?  Is SHA256 encryption about to be cracked?  Those are the things which would worry me about holding bitcoin.  These days, especially with deteriorating economic conditions, my bitcoin is letting me sleep like a baby.  \n  \nSure, we may have another year of lackluster price performance, but no fundamentals have changed.  If anything, we're closer to halving the inflation rate again, we have improved scaling in the protocol and layer 2, and solid support for a higher price floor that has held for a year now.  I'm a patient guy and in the long run, this is the investment I'm least concerned with.",

            "Text": "\u201cWhy are you into bitcoin?  For me, it's a chance to hold hard money, secure, and inflation limited.\u201d\n\nOogally that theory was valid until the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash which basically imposes that when supply of a particular coin is exhausted, developers can just create a hard fork to generate a new supply of that coin. With Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin\u2019s supply virtually doubled. Bitcoin Cash is identical to Bitcoin in code with the exception of block size limit. That\u2019s what makes cryptocurrency a precarious asset and form of investment. There are far too many coins and hard forks in existence. Why does Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Silver even exist other than serving as scams? The whole idea of \u201cfinite supply\u201d is contradictory when hard forks can be erected. Sure, Bitcoin Cash at $420 today hasn\u2019t taken away too much from Bitcoin\u2019s true value, not to mention it\u2019s impractical to interpolate Bitcoin\u2019s price today if BCH, BGold and Silver didn\u2019t exist. I assume BTC would be in the same ballpark. But, remember when Bitcoin was $17K, BCash was $4K taking off a much more significant chunk of Bitcoin\u2019s true value. And this will be more concerning with Bitcoin\u2019s fate when the crypto market is in the trillions. Developers will get greedy and erect more hard forks to further distribute more wealth off Bitcoin. So, if you\u2019re a firm believer of Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply, you\u2019re vastly misinformed since hard fork exist and will continue to exist in greater numbers.",

Then it hit mainstream and average joe, during reversion of economic situation. That was pure coincidence, there had to be a moment it hit mainstream, and it happened during a better economic year, by coincidence. That doesn't mean crypto existentie and demand for it wasn't the cause of macro economic environment and crisis. You dummy.",

Reason is that doing so would not facilitate distribution of the coins more widely and thus cannot make the higher price level sustainable. In other words, too few people will be sitting on too much bitcoin wealth if such a continuous appreciation occurred. \n\nThis is the main reason for the peaks and deep valleys of bitcoin price enroute to the steady state. The price fall is far from worrisome. Infact it was only to be expected albeit timing your sell to take advantage of this pre ordained price mechanism is not easy at all. So HoDL.",

Some can have minor use cases and others may continue with the use case of gambling that sustains most crypto shitcoins.\n\nThe pristine Bitcoin blockchain is one that will always have a distinct identity by virtue of being the first and also the most secure crypto. It also benefits from the network advantage. Increasing number of forks and coins might be a concern for any of the other myriad coins but this factor does not bother me in the least about diluting the value Bitcoin itself to any great degree. You can see this at work right now with 1800+ coins on coinmarketcap and yet the market piling into bitcoin and raising the dominance ratio throughout this year. \n\nI know this ratio was once 90% but that was before the altcoin market had any kind of mature existence at all. The fact that the dominance ratio again climbed after an alt craze like last dec shows that Bitcoin has an absolute special place within crypto and won't be susceptible to dilution by any fork or altcoin.\n\nThere is also the point that any coin that can even hope to get past the network advantage barrier must be a fork of Bitcoin and if this is the case then again holding Bitcoin is safe as you would gain ownership of the forks as well and thus lose nothing even from the dilution.",
