My general impression is that most people don't time this market well, usually they sell too early and buy back in too early or sell and never come back only to check the price a few years later and regret.  Why would this time be any different?  We could be in for a prolonged bear market but that doesn't mean this is going to die out.  The history of bitcoin already is a fascinating story, do you really think this is how it ends?  If so, Hollywood won't be able to make a blockbuster movie about it, not enough has happened to impact the world yet.  ",

When this post is two hours old I'm selling off >800 BTC\n\nu/fauxmosexual\n\nI really believe in the future of BTC, I invested nearly all of my life savings in it, and after MUCH soul searching I realised I have to get off this crazy ride. Fortunately if the current price holds I'm not losing too much, but I can't afford to risk any further losses. I NEED to convert back to standard currency. I've made a fool of myself, cost me and my family too much because of my greed and delusions, and I'm at the point where I have to cut and run.\n\nThis community has been great and although I haven't participated I've lurked a long time and have been staggered by the willingness of people to put their money where their mouth is to change the world for the better. I'm really sorry to do this, but I have no choice but to sell off >8000 BTC which may be enough to spark another panic sell off. I don't want you, my fellow /r/bitcoiners, to be left holding devalued BTC so to clear my conscience I'm giving this community a few hours warning.\n\nI will begin my sell-off at 0500 GMT, which will lower the price significantly. If you plan to get off this crazy ride anytime soon you may like to consider doing so before then, or be prepared to hold your BTC for the long haul. Please upvote this post for visibility (I recieve no karma for this self post) but I would appreciate it if you don't blog, twitter, or share this outside of the community. I want to give my fellow redditors a chance to sell but I don't want to crash the market before I do. Please keep it within reddit, thanks.\n\nPlease accept my deepest apologies for what I am about to do to the bitcoin market.\n\ne: I can't change the title, it was meant to be >8000\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c6kzy/i_dont_want_to_screw_anyone_but_i_have_to_get_off/?st=JIZX6TOT&sh=393182d3",

One study shows there are about 30% of coins now in play that had  been locked up by whales.\n\nSo of course price fell as april deadline approached.\n\nThat started a lot of margin call forced sales and panic selling.\n\nAnd of course it is harder to get on exchanges at all because of all the verification now. Even bitcoin atms require verification.\n\n\nSo can individual buying be big enough to make big price moves like in the past with those restrictions now?\n\nSo the other big question is when will institutional money come in strong. Some already happened.\n\nOf course the big institutional nay sayers like Jamie Dimon have now started saying everyone should have some bitcoin. I dont know if that means they were secretly buying before when they were being negative and are now selling their secret positions to the retail customer or if they are now going to be buying more.

People constantly whining that they are down in their investment or letting everyone know they are selling because the price is crashing is embarrassing. Or, zombies asking 'when moon/lambo?' which is not even remotely humorous anymore. And, for those that claim no factual information by crying 'Bitcoin is dead', or 'mining is ruining the environment', have some dignity. You sound like assholes. Statements like these are grossly nearsighted  and paint a grim picture of where Bitcoin is headed. These comments are flat out false and driven by ignorance and fear. Dumb, uneducated, and false commentary adds nothing to the discussion here. \n",

            "Text": "No kidding. I think the most popular guess this week is 4K. All kinds of people are throwing that one out there. They are like I'm going to look at a few years ago and see what happened and then I'm going to make only one plan that includes the exact same thing happening again. Often times I ask them so what will you do if you're wrong? Crickets chirp\n\nThe safest way I see to play this if you have the time to do it is buy support levels and set stops on the break. If 5800 holds great you look for the higher high and higher low. If you get continuation then you can get more aggressive. If 5800 does not hold you look at 53 to 55. Get an entry on a wick and set a stop. Look for a continuation pattern. You basically repeat this process fishing for bottoms\n\nOr if you just don't want to be bothered with trading or you have realized you're not very good at it because your emotional; cost averaging has been a great way to play markets over the years. \n\nI personally don't see how the fundamentals support a retrace to 4K which would be the equivalent of the last bear market but it is something that I can't completely discount so risk management has to be part of the strategy",

Then, placed under a load for another while, the developers will work out upgrade implementations like all open source software, and it will eventually make its way into more and more mainstream financial operations.   \nThe biggest problem with all of this is that people expect way too much too soon. The internet started with military in the 60's and took years to finally make it's way into mainstream use and then years more to accommodate large file transfers and now look at it. Bitcoin also starts with a niche group, and as it becomes more accessible and user friendly we'll be using it before you even realize.  \nHowever, that being said, if you look at the investment more than the currency, you'll focus on the day to day token price and go mad. Hold it, buy more if you have money you can risk and wait it out. Only a fool would think Bitcoin is going away in terms of advancement over time.",

            "Text": "I haven't been here since the top in 2013. I actually heard about the crash afterwards, and started doing research into Bitcoin early 2014. I'll admit, I was **very skeptical** at first. Nonetheless, I decided to start dollar cost averaging small amounts by spring 2014. Sentiment at that time was **very** low, and quite similar to the sentiment I'm seeing now. People saying Bitcoin saying was a ponzi scheme, it didn't work, \"the company\" will go bankrupt, it's not secure, etc. I've heard and read it all. They all had one thing in common: a poor understanding of how Bitcoin actually works. None of those critics took any time to read the whitepaper or do any kind of research into the technology. On top of that, bear markets bring \"irrational despair\" just as much as bull markets bring \"irrational exuberance\".\n\nIf there is one thing for certain, crypto is not going away. It's a genie that has been let out of the bottle. If you're a long term holder like myself, sentiment cycles do not phase you. ",

            "Text": "But it's been this way forever. The weak are afraid to buy or even hold, the only thing they buy is the fear and give in to it. Then they react with childishness, and start throwing insults at the very same thing they were praising just a short while ago.   \n\n\nIt's typical human behavior and that's why the more intelligent people are risk takers and make money. They see the opportunity where everyone just sees fear and doom. Rinse and repeat - and yet some people just act like sheep and fall into pattern. Deep down everyone knows Bitcoin is going to be here longer than any of us, but it's easier to think short term and prioritize the fear.",

That guy can barely write one sentence without a mistake.\n\nDeflation is bad for the economy. Ask Japan how happy they feel about their deflationary currency, they've been trying to inflate the JPY for over 2 decades now. Everybody looks at inflation from the point of view of the people who hoard money (not assets but actual money) and forget that while inflation causes the loss of a little purchasing power for those hoarders, deflation would lead to their unemployment and even greater loss of purchasing power. The people Paul is talking about are the first ones who are let go once revenue streams dry up due to people refusing to spend their deflationary money.\n\nDo you know any other deflationary currencies that people refuse to spend and are HODLing because they believe it will be worth more in the future?",

If we see a $100k Bitcoin some day (assuming an increased supply at that point to 18 million total mined coins) that would give us a nearly $1.8 trillion market cap. I think the next one or two bubbles could probably get us there. So with those assumptions in mind, buying around these prices is very much near \"the bottom\".",

You can't get rich by making a comfortable decision, by then it's too late. Many people have million dollar ideas but very few implement them and get a million dollars.

Look at the past decade, consider that most people never even heard of it a year ago, and now there's billions being spent all over the globe on infrastructure to make it more accessible. AND we don't even have wallet address translation in place for non tech-savvy users yet. This is just the beginning!!  \n\n\nYou really need to stop looking at the token price, because that's INCREDIBLY short sighted. WHY THE FAWK would I post a picture to support my statement? Seriously, this is Reddit. I don't give a flying crap about who believes me or who don't, I'm just stating my perspective. It just happens that Bitcoin has dropped and recovered like this over and over and that was before the global interest it has now.",

            "Text": ">if Bitcoin rises again before you die\n\nBa hahha. You really believe this crap or are you just trolling. Bitcoin does this over and over because it's not only new, it's something that we need to learn how to deal with - both a currency AND an investment.Anyone that's been paying attention from the beginning is relaxed,  buying and will average down and then it will rise, and then likely fall again.It does NOT matter if it's $10 or $100,000, it's relative and it dropped almost 90&#37; a few years back. This is old news but many people here never even bought Bitcoin until a year (or less) ago lol.\n\nThe drama in here is hilarious!!\n\nYou got one thing right though - Bitcoin will be around for the time when you die, and long after.",

            "Text": "I have to point to the catastrophe concept, that the easiest and most simple form of life happens during a catastrophe.\n\nSo, what does that mean? Well, I lived through Hurricane Sandy. Here is a rundown:\n\n1. CASH ONLY no credit or debit cards.\n2. ATM's were out of cash as everyone ran to get cash. \n3. BANKS were closed with no power. As were ATM's.\n4. Wifi? There was no wifi. There was limited cell service also, and we had no power in which to charge our phones unless we went to the Dunkin Doughnuts. \n\nSo, this tells me that Bitcoin, or any other electronic coin, fails the most important test, and that's the catastrophe test. Now, for the consumer, there is no fee for me to put my money in a bank, and use a debit card. There is a fee paid by the merchant. Some merchants want cash, but most prefer electronic because it means there is less cash on hand for employees to steal, lowering their insurance risk of loss. So, merchants pay a fee to the CC processor, and also get a lowered risk assessment of theft. The old way was all cash, but you had to pay the manager much more so they didn't steal the cash and run out the door. \n\nRight now, I would have to pay a fee to buy bitcoin. As long as there is a fee, there is no incentive for me to incur an extra step. Plus, it's extra work. I exchange my FIAT to the bank's digital FIAT, then I take my digital FIAT and purchase digital BITCOIN, to then pay digitally to a merchant, who then takes that digital Bitcoin and converts it to digital FIAT, to then get paper FIAT. It's an awful lot of steps to go through. \n\nAnyway, I love the concept of bitcoin, but like MySpace, it's still just too new. Plus, there is zero inherent value in swapping my digital FIAT to Digital Bitcoin to pay at stores. Maybe in the future it will, but as Hurricane Sandy proved, CASH is still king.",
