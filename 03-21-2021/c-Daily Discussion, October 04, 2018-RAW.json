Who has the privilege of deciding what pull requests get merged and ultimately isn't this going against decentralisation by giving power to these select few? What criteria's need to be met to get pull requests merged? Is there a minimum number of approvers required? Do certain approvers have more weighting than others? The people who have the privilege of merging code changes have a great deal of power to influence Bitcoins code base which is my main concern and this seems like an easy point of attack to me. ",

Other people merge changes though. I see some people merge their own branches, after it is discussed. \n\nIn a way, you have to trust that if these devs were tyrants, then there wouldn't be [so many contributers.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors) And anyone is able to register a github account and join the discussion. But you have to have something code related to talk about. Github is not a good place for politics. But if you spend enough time reading what other devs are working on, and the comments they are leaving on other people's code, you get a clearer picture of how it works. In the end, yes there are a few people who make the tough call on things like block size. A camel is a horse designed by committee. If they had an election for every merge, the code would become shit very fast. \n\n[Also maybe check out this video](https://youtu.be/MGiv-OuIA5I?t=1m26s)",
