I go to the hot dog cart down the road and buy a dog, and pay with BTC. Now this guy knows the address the BTC came from. He can go and see that I have almost 1 BTC left in my wallet, and get his buddy to rob me next time i'm in the area.\n\nAnd a second example. Say I have a bunch of addresses in my wallet that I received salary payments to. They all come from addresses known to third party analytics services as being my company. Then I go buy a car with my BTC, and I use up several of the outputs in my wallet, but to pay the whole thing, I need to spend a little from a big address with 100 BTC in it. A number I would prefer people weren't aware of, for good reasons. Now because all the txs are bundled, my 100 BTC is tainted with my personal information. Anyone can go look up how much wealth I have.\n\nSo the question I have is, how is this better than the old way of doing things? At least in the old system, something(VISA, BofA) had to be compromised for this information to be exposed. Under BTC, it's all out in the open for anyone to know. Am I missing something?",

But Bitcoin isn't a private entity with a capitalist agenda. It's a new form of currency with a lot of copycats, which confuse the issue to the layman and cause him to cautiously decide to to get on board.

            "Text": "> So the question I have is, how is this better than the old way of doing things?\n\nThere are some best practices, like using receiving addresses only once, trying to avoid KYC services if possible, etc.  \n\nThe most effective practice though is to use a wallet that allows something called \"coin control\". This means, the wallet gives you options to choose between different inputs, when you are about to make a new outgoing transaction. So f.ex you could use only those inputs that are already \"tainted\" with your personal information, for a certain types of transactions (if you want to send them to another KYC compliant merchant).   \n\nFor other types of transactions you might want to select inputs that are **not** tainted with your personal information and so on.  \n\nThis is all a bit tricky, but doable if you value your privacy (which you should do). The most advanced and user friendly wallet right now is [Wasabi wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io). It not only allows you to do coin control, but also something called \"coinjoin\". Which basically mixes your inputs with the inputs of other users, to such a degree that a chain analysis software cannot differ anymore between your inputs and the inputs of other users. There are some videos on youtube that explain it a little better, as well as some info floating around on r/bitcoin (and I think Wasabi might have their own subreddit).  \n\nedit: I misread your question (in my quote) thinking you are asking for a better (more private) way to do transactions, sorry! :) ",

            "Text": "Well what your first point is mostly addressed by not keeping much in hot wallets and only move some money from cold wallets when necessary. This is mostly due to security concerns but also helps adjusting the 'privacy' issues you are underlining.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing to note is that you can have as many addresses as you want with your bitcoin spread however you like. Even if they use some graph traversal algorithms to figure out the transaction history between those addresses they can never be sure that those are yours. There are many people with hundreds of addresses with less than 0.5 bitcoin in them and they keep groups of such addresses isolated enough that it cannot be tracked. I do not see this being a necessity for most folks since trying to erase your footprint this hard is mostly used to avoid legal stuff, but it is nice to know there are ways around it. There are even privacy coins where you can convert your Bitcoin into and out of and make it pretty much impossible to be traced.",

Selling seems to be exhausted but we all know anything can happen. The main thing is to not assume anything with price movement in either direction because again, nobody knows if the price will continue to move lower or not. Nobody.",

There is just a fucking ton of people on the sidelines waiting for a bottom to be in and this series of lower lows to be over. Having the price run down to $2,000 on heavy volume and snap back up would be great because then we could talk about getting an uptrend going. People will Panic sell the entire way down and that's what causes capitulation. It's going to be a forced event from people who absolutely have to sell. Roger ver is a primary target with this.

I have purchased items from internet retailers directly in Bitcoin, in fact I spent BTC 8 times last year. \n\nI get what (I infer) you mean that it's not yet the go-to payment method overall. It's not accepted by the big supermarkets or Amazon, but it IS usable and it used.\n\nI also don't think the success of BTC is dependent on the success of alts. BCH has lost about 70% of its value and dragged every crypto down. But as time goes on BCH drops are having less effect on BTC price.\n\nIMHO and all that, but yeah feel free to change my mind. ",

Borderline fascinating actually. If anyone needs any validation of why crypto has behaved like it has the last year, look no further then here - the entire space is comprised of absolute cretins minus a few savvy devs and some savage fiat traders.",

Bigger blocks and some of the other schenanigns played into bitmains hands with mining and asic boost. Blockstream wanted nothing to do with them. Big blocks started to get traction with bitcoin xt. Ver and wu took that and created their own. They invested obscene amounts of money in it. Its basically the biggest flop crypto has ever seen.",

Before that it was all second hand news from a few mining buddies. Either way, I plan to keep it in my investments and based on way too many things to type in here (you seem to have already made up your mind anyway and hey, whatever floats your boat I say!) I firmly believe bitcoin will continue to rise in both value and infrastructure growth for many years to come. I not betting hundreds of thousands on it, but after being a part of and watching countless tech projects evolve over the past 20 years, I have a pretty good idea of what will work and what will not. So a bad year here and there does not phase me in the least.",

There has to be something special about a crypto that has existed for ten years -- if you have to pick one to succeed that will be the one. And frankly, I don't see there being more than one or possibly two cryptos in another decade; LN and LN-like systems that use BTC as the underlying value and add functionality in a second layer is exactly how I see things playing out.",
