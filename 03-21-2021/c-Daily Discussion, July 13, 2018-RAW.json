            "Text": "Many people see the rising global debt as an indication of a coming economic collapse. I agree that current levels of debt are unsustainable ; however I don't believe the economic \"meltdown\" will proceed as many believe it will. Most people when they think of economic collapse associate it with the collapse of markets; real-estate, stock markets, etc.\n\nBut when debt truly reaches unsustainable levels economic collapse doesn't manifest as falling markets. It will manifest as skyrocketing markets.\n\nWe are already paying a significant fraction of the US budget to just pay the interest on our current debt. 7.4% of our total budget is spent just on the interest on the US debt. Each year this % rises and at a certain point we will be faced with cutting other programs in order to just pay the interest on this debt. This is known as austerity.\n\nAusterity in Europe happens because no one country controls the currency. So when greece goes into debt; it can't just create more money to pay off that debt. It must cut programs or raise taxes to pay that debt.\n\nIn the US on the other hand; we control the worlds reserve currency. So as our debt increases; and our interest payments increase; we can print more money to pay off those interest payments.\n\nBut the USD is itself an instrument of Debt. So printing more money just increases the debt; increasing the interest payments ; increasing the need to print more money and go deeper in debt.\n\nThis pattern has repeated itself countless times throughout history.\n\nThe collapse will actually cause prices of everything to increase at increasing rates. Owners of assets and means of production will greatly benefit ; those on fixed salaries or income will lose.\n\nPeople think that Bitcoin is a bubble; but don't even consider that Fiat may be in an enormous bubble.\n\nFiat currencies have no intrinsic value; they have literally nothing backing it at all. Unless somehow you think violence is backing. There are some legal requirements that give it some value (because you must pay taxes in it); Its just special paper with some hightech inks; but beyond that the value of dollars are entirely psychological.\n\nBitcoin on the other hand is backed by energy; Bitcoin is Stored Work. Not only is it just random \"Stored Work\" ; but the work thats stored is the work of securing itself! In addition to being backed by energy and work; Bitcoin exists independent of any State. Countries can come and go; but Bitcoin is not dependent on any. Bitcoins incentive system makes it very likely that people will keep working for Bitcoin for decades if not hundreds or even thousands of years from now.\n\nThe world needs a global reserve currency ; and we need a currency that cannot be manipulated by corrupt individuals. That is why we have Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be changed; it cannot be bent to the whims of any politician. They can't inflate or deflate it. Bitcoin is money independent of politics. Bitcoin is the Jubilee the world has been waiting for.\n\n**War is Over**\n\n**If you Want it**",

Moreover, the probability of BTC's price charting a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern would have dropped sharply had BTC found acceptance below $6,000.\n\nFurther, the sharp recovery from $6,080 to $6,283 has opened the doors to re-test of $6,400, the price chart analysis indicates.\n\nView\n\nBTC could attack the $6,400 mark, but further gains are ruled out for now as the descending (bearish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $6,366 and $6,500, respectively.\n\nThat said, if BTC manages to close (as per UTC) today above 10-day MA, then the doors would open for a re-test of the Monday's high of $6,820.\n\nBearish scenario: A failure to produce a significant move higher despite the bullish price RSI divergence and the falling wedge breakout would shift risk in favor of a drop to a recent low of $5,755. The downside move will likely gather pace if BTC fails to hold above $6,080 (previous day's high) over the weekend.",

It is near impossible to bring outsiders into crypto space at the moment. Mainly because of the nature of asic and bitmain. Btc is pretty much controlled by bitmain at the moment so who in their right mind would invest their hard earned money into btc which directly and indirectly go to bitmain. Any substantial value increase will cause bitmain to dump and will create a downward trend again.\n\nAside from that, scams are out of fucking control. So even if outsiders ignore asic and bitmain(HUGE PROBLEM THAT DEFEATS PURPOSE OF CRYPTO), they will get burned by inevitable scams and they wont invest anymore money.\n\nAlso, try explaining bitcoin cash or ICOs to the average Joe without sounding like a complete retard for having money tied up in crypto.

On record it has never been successful\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghash.io\n\nBitmain is close to 51% but chances are they wont attempt double spend. They spread their hashing power across 3 pools (maybe more).\nStill isn't going to stop them from turning people off crypto as it becomes centralized and monopolized which defeats the point of crypto. At the moment they are their own, and cryptos, worst enemy.\n\nOff topic but good to know:\nNeo is centralized because their nodes are private. Ripple is centralized too. the three worst cryptos at the moment (out of top 20) are BTC, Neo and ripple (not including bcash because it is really infuriating to people who understand crypto that it exists and has the market cap it does. better to just ignore it as it will inevitably be worth nothing in the future). This is due to the community not fully grasping the original (and only benefit over fiat) purpose of crypto\n\nThe best crypto in terms of not becoming centralized (51% attacks) and as far as anonymity goes is Monero.   The reason why monero is polarizing and doesn't get the praise it deserves is because they are anti asic(monopolization and centralization). Bitmain scammed people by selling asic miners (at a  really reduced price) for cryptonight algo knowing monero was in the process of altering the algo to brick the asic.  So people that are sheep and bird brain got burned HARD. \n\nhttps://www.ccn.com/monero-declares-war-asic-manufacturers/\n\n\nPeople in crypto that understand the purpose prefer Monero over Ethereum and Ethereum over BTC.  All other cryptos are virtually the same as BTC, Ethereum and monero because they use their algos with very little or nothing changed (hence why people call them scams). the majority of alt coins are ethereum based algo because its platform and algo are the easiest for newbs to make shitcoins on (tron is one of these coins). you can blame ethereum for all these ico airdrop scams.

Gone are the days of anonymous Swiss numbered bank accounts.  Moving physical cash is logistically challenging.  \n\nIn fact, the only real way to monitor bitcoin is when it interacts with the banking system.  Otherwise huge sums of money can be moved anonymously without any interference.  ",

            "Text": "Bull market indicates outsiders coming in.  the huge wave of outsiders coming in is done.  It is near impossible to bring outsiders into crypto space at the moment.  Mainly because of the nature of asic and bitmain.  Btc is pretty much controlled by bitmain at the moment so who in their right mind would invest their hard earned money into btc which directly and indirectly go to bitmain.  Any substantial value increase will cause bitmain to dump and will create a downward trend again.\n\nAside from that, scams are out of fucking control.   So even if outsiders  ignore asic and bitmain(HUGE PROBLEM THAT DEFEATS PURPOSE OF CRYPTO),  they will get burned by inevitable scams and they wont invest anymore money.\n\nAlso, try explaining bitcoin cash or ICOs to the average Joe without sounding like a complete retard for having money tied up in crypto.  If anything, the hardcore fan boys that dont fully grasp abstract concepts are destroying this industry",

There are a lot of companies that are moving certain operations to Blockchain for reasons and purposes that have utterly nothing to do with BTC, and hodlrs of BTC don't make a tenth of a penny in technology royalties from businesses using Blockchain. The most likely result is that the transaction costs of dealing with government currencies will decrease in areas such as wire-transfers, currency conversions, and credit card transactions, which will further obviate the need for BTC. Then, of course, there are BTC's numerous other problems such as susceptibility to market manipulation, high volatility, and the linger reputation of an \"investment\" that costs many thousands of people many billions of dollars (or their local currency) worldwide. Bitcoin may survive at some level for dark activities, but BTC's chances of replacing any significant governmental currency is probably much less than 1 in 10,000.",

The open source community for Bitcoin is stronger than ever, and the Lightning Network is the beginning of much more layering and improvements coming down the pipe. There have been well respected business people claiming Bitcoin will be an excellent fit for real estate transactions among many applications. We don't even have wallet address translation yet, and non technical people have no user friendly platform for onboarding, but it's clearly coming. \nFocusing only in the coin price is silly, but there's the fact that Bitcoin jas crashed like this many many times, in fact it's crashed worse at a 90% drop once. We are in early days, but I do understand that a quick look at the outside view of this would lead one to feel pessimistic. Just remember, in the early days of cars, the speed limit was only 20 mph, because they didn't want to spook the horses.",

Crypto isn't money and will never be used as such (except for a relative handful of nerds).\n\nLike, think about this for 10 fucking seconds.  \n\n1.  It's WAY too volatile to ever be currency.  Only a small fraction of people will have the risk tolerance to be in at all. \n\n2.  Every transaction is a taxable event.  Every. Single. Transaction.  Now you're going to have to transform whole segments of society that fill out a 1040 ez form into 1040 with long schedule Cs - tax headaches for people who make basic wages?  LOL no.\n\n3.  People who hodl bitcoin won't want to spend on the way up (my pizza will be worth 20% more tomorrow!) or the way down (I'll lose 10% if I buy that cupcake).  Either way - this isn't transactional currency.  And that's just for everyday transactions.  Try closing a fucking complicated financing deal with bitcoin?  It would be a fucking nightmare - trust me, I do this for a living.  How are you going to pick a price months out on an asset that can gain or lose as much as 20% in a fucking day?  \n\n4.  It's complicated.  Oh, sure a few nerds will get into it.  Got to think about Aunt Sally.  WTF does Aunt Sally know about hard wallets, soft wallets, cold storage, exchanges, hard forks, soft forks, 51% attacks, lightning network. . .it's going to make her head spin.  You know what Aunt Sally does when her head starts to spin?  That's right she orders a gin and tonic and pays for it with good old fashioned greenbacks.\n\nTo be attractive, currency must be stable.  Currency is also (slowly) inflationary for very good reasons.  Y'all need to stop conflating investments with currency - really bad idea, never going to work.  As a practical matter, the only thing people actually do with bitcoin is trade it. \n\nThat and engage in illicit activities - bitcoin will be useful for black markets, human trafficking, terrorism, drug trade. . . that is a useful feature of bitcoin.  Without a doubt illicit acts are bitcoin's killer app, and for that reason alone I predict heavy heavy regulations.\n\nBut other than that, the broad population doesn't need it and won't adopt it.

The open source community for Bitcoin is stronger than ever, and the Lightning Network is the beginning of much more layering and improvements coming down the pipe. There have been well respected business people claiming Bitcoin will be a excellent for real estate transactions among many applications. We don't even have wallet address translation yet and non technical people have user friendly platform to onboarding but it's clearly coming. \nFocusing only in the coin price is silly, but there's the fact that Bitcoin jas crashed like this many many times, in fact it's crashed worse at a 90% drop once. We are in early days, but I do understand that a quick look at the outside view of this would lead one to feel pessimistic. Just remember, in the early days of cars, the speed limit was only 20 mph, because they didn't want to spook the horses.",
