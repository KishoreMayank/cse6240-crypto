I sold around 7k, not because I wanted to but because I could not afford to lose my initial investment after a series of financial hardships.  What was once money I could afford to lose, I could no longer afford to lose due to circumstances outside of my control.  For two months straight, we had negative stories every day, from every media outlet about crypto.  Then magically after Feb the 5th, nothing but positive stories about Bitcoin going to the moon.  Before everyone shouts \"That's what you get for not hodling!\", remember that hindsight is always 20/20 and that not everyone can afford to stay in if the ship sinks and you have a family to feed.  This seems very clearly like market manipulation.  Where is anyone asking about Tether now?  For two solid months it was trumpeted that Tether was going to hurt Bitcoin irreparably and now...crickets even though there has not been a finding.  I more than doubled my initial investment and I'm happy for anyone that has done better.  I WANT Bitcoin to succeed and go to the moon.  I just also want to know if powers that be are running mass smearing campaigns followed by mass positive campaigns to manipulate this market.  (I think I already know the answer to my question)  Just want to know what the rest of the community thinks.  ",

They are like 1.5x above where they were at market peak. Why this is bad news is that they have been piling up for the last few days FOLLOWING the rebound, and haven't closed. However, usually this would result in a commensurate raise in prices. It has not, it has been sold into heavily. If we drop another 500 or so, we will start seeing a catapult effect downward due to long squeeze. Thereafter, shorts will kick back down and push it lower.\n\nThe key is for BTC to go over about 8800. If not, this could become apocalyptic quickly. ",

You should understand why centralized exchange is bad.\n\n1. Assume BTC market price is 20k.\n\n2. Centralized exchange can put up a sell order @ significantly lower than 20k, selling NON-EXISTENT bitcoin.\n\n3. Some user bought this fake bitcoin at 19k, with usdt, say.  As long as this fake bitcoin is not withdrawn to the user's private wallet, it's just a number in the buyer's exchange account.\n\n4. Centralized exchange continue low ball selling fake bitcoin.\n\n5. Panic sell starts.\n\n6. Exchange put up buy orders, using those accumulated usdt to buy up real bitcoin at a cheaper price.\n\nWhat if panic sell fails and price shoot up?  What if a massive # of users trying to withdrawal at the same time?  The centralized exchanges now go into maintenance mode, or claiming \"hacked\".\n\nFeel free to downvote if you think this is nonsense.\n",

Clearly they move in herds or the global switch from FUD to sunshine-pumpers memo was circulated \n\nIt's a bargain under $9K!!!

            "Text": "Well actually ..\n>One or two speakers touched on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Let me first say that we are not observing a systemically relevant holding of digital currencies by supervised institutions \u2013 by banks, in other words. Actually, the credit institutions established in the European Union are showing a limited appetite for digital currencies like Bitcoin, notwithstanding the high level of public interest. However, recent developments, such as the listing of Bitcoin futures contracts by US exchanges, could lead European banks too to hold positions in Bitcoin, and therefore we will certainly look at that.\nHowever, we should understand that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are in the unregulated space and should be regarded as very risky assets. Virtual currencies are subject to high volatility and **their prices are entirely speculative**. Banks should measure the risk of any holdings of digital currencies in their portfolio accordingly. Right now, digital currencies are not subject to a specific supervisory approach. Work is under way in the Single Supervisory Mechanism to identify potential prudential risks that these digital assets could pose to supervised institutions.\n\n[Source](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2018/html/ecb.sp180205.en.html)",

I tend to think, though, that it's really just market sentiment that determines whether news impacts as OMG BAD NEWS SELL! SELL! vs  *Whatevs, I'm still buying.* There's been a rumor since last night that Binance was hacked and it didn't seem to have any impact at all. A few days ago, a rumor like that probably would driven the price down $2000. When people are nervous, they react differently than when they're relatively calm.",

            "Text": ">  For two months straight, we had negative stories every day, from every media outlet about crypto. Then magically after Feb the 5th, nothing but positive stories about Bitcoin going to the moon.\n\nGood point. Before jumping to conclusions, I would stop for a moment and look at how the media has a habit of doing this about a lot of things. But it has been strange to watch the last 3-4 days of BTC \"reporting\".\n\nLet's hope we see some slow and steady growth now, not spikes and stomach churning drops.",

Largely ignored by banks at first, the situation today looks very different. **Even the European Central Bank has to acknowledge cryptocurrency will not go away**. \n\n> European Central Bank Wants More Cryptocurrency Research\n> Until now, policymakers have not paid too much attention to Bitcoin and similar currencies. This is especially true in the European Union. A few countries introduced their own taxation guidelines, such as The Netherlands. On a European level, however, **the ECB has no plans to regulate Bitcoin. Nor do they have the power to do so effectively**. \n\n\n> It is evident more research is needed before any conclusions can be made. Tackling cryptocurrency regulation is a very touchy subject. **This is mainly because no one can control the currencies themselves. Not even the European Central bank would be able to do so**. They can introduce more guidelines to help mitigate any impact on local economies. For now, no one knows for sure if and how such a solution will come to market.",

The stock market is not largely based on speculation although of course there is some (shortvol a recent example). A sophisticated investor can build a portfolio and know the exact amount of risk (it's measurable) that they are taking to make \"x\" return and see if it is worth the risk. There are also things like ETF's that allow you to hold hundreds of companies through one security so you are diversified. \n\nThere is speculation in the stock market sure, but there is a lot of passive investing where people are just looking for modest returns to beat inflation and save for retirement which expsosure to the markets up to your risk tolerance, then balanced out with less volatile investments, can offer. This is based on a large sample size as well.\n",

To u/Smith056 I'd say it's also not a bad idea, in that scenario, to recoup your original investment plus 20% and then buy back in with the remaining 80% of your turnover profit. $8150 isn't too different from $7k as a re-entry point. Obviously you can replace the % above with whatever works for your finances, but I've used this strategy in several other financial endeavors and it's served to placate the FOMO as well as any attention you paid to the FUD. But the FOMO is real and healthy. I used it early in apple pre-7Xsplit pre-$100 and after the first double the rest has been on the house my friend. *Not to mention several other failures*",

Too much toxic bullshit was showing up on the front page and people kept begging the moss to do something. Others like me me occassionally pleaded that they not do something too aggressive because I like memes and jokes (and community) served up with my bitcoin news and tech talk. Lord only knows what else went on behind the scenes to effect their decision but Daily discussion eventually came of it, and it has slowly purified into a festering sore. Thank goodness for Mentor Monday. I was wrong about this kind of stuff helping foster a fun sense of community.",

            "Text": "Bets on the future market influence the prices on the future markets, and then people who have large assets can arbitrage the cash price (your exchange price) against the future price (the bets). That's called \"cash and carry\" or \"reverse cash and carry\" depending on which one you do (sell or buy the actual bitcoin and take the opposite position on the future market).  By taking these actions on the actual cash market (your exchange), these people move the price of the two markets closer. This keeps going until the prices are virtually the same, since there is no risk money to be earned as long as there remains a difference in price.  \nSo because of C&C and RC&C, the cash vs. future prices can only differ by a tiny fraction.  That fraction actually corresponds to the cost of financing, over the time period that separates the day of arbitrage from the settlement day of the future.  But basically, you can count on it, arbitragers WILL align prices to the same level across different exchanges, markets, futures, etc.",

            "Text": "ACH takes 3-5 days per the system, but there are two topics that spin off with regards to Coinbase.\n\nFirst is that you might have a wire transfer option available.  Wire transfers do have a fee that's set by your bank, but they typically process within 1 business day (whenever your bank processes their next batch of wire transfers).\n\nSecond, this somewhat depends on how Coinbase is regulated in your area since that changes what account features are available, but if you can do a purchase that pulls from your bank immediately (as opposed to sending money to your Coinbase account, then buying coins once it's cleared) then your price will be locked in immediately and the coins will just be frozen until the ACH transfer comes through.  Like my CB account doesn't have a USD wallet, so I can make a purchase for 1 BTC @ $8250 via ACH right now, and my CB account will be credited that 1 (frozen) BTC and an ACH transfer will be initiated for $8250, then once the ACH transfer completes that 1 BTC will be unfrozen.  It means if I did that today and the price crashes tomorrow, I couldn't sell it (since it would still be frozen), but if I'm looking at holding beyond 3 days then that doesn't really matter.",

I've had so many responses saying \"You over extended yourself.\" despite clearly stating that my financial position changed drastically AFTER I made my initial investment.  At the time, I certainly could afford to lose that money and I would never gamble with money I would need to feed my family.  Also, whether I believe in Bitcoin or not as the future is irrelevant if the masses become convinced that it is not and crash the value of it.  I did not sell because I believed the stories, I sold because too many people were believing the stories and sold off driving the value further and further down.  I just wonder if everyone thinks the constant negative stories followed by a sudden abrupt reversal is coincidence or coordinated.  Regardless, thanks for understanding the real question I was asking and not responding with a knee-jerk \"You shouldn't have over-extended yourself.\"   ",

The community has grown a bunch the past year, so there are a lot of new people, but what I was seeing was a lot more hyperbolic than I'd expect with that growth.",

This creates inflation, which creates higher wages and higher costs of borrowing on a companies debt. This also means investors can now get better yield from safer investments so they sell stocks. Also the recent blow out of XIV is having spillover effects. Volatility is high right now but there is nothing unusual happening.  You can always just index if you do not want to purchase individual stocks or you do not have enough money to properly diversify.\n\nCan you show me how you determined the value of \"stocks\" and how they are overpriced? P/E's are high but the tax changes could change that unless rates continue to rise.\n\nNo there is no EXACT measurement of risk but here are some ratios that are used to determine risks to get you started:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activerisk.asp\n\nIs there froth in BTC or is it undervalued? My point is you can't say. \n\nSorry you don't like people that have different opinions then you :( That's a pretty shitty trait. ",

            "Text": "The MACD and RSI are indicators that show you momentum. \n\nThe MACD takes two moving averages (for example, one with 12 periods, one with 26 periods) and checks the difference. The difference is called the MACD line. In a sense, this is like a taking the first derivative. Then, another moving average of the MACD line is taken, this one is called the signal line. \n\nA moving average of the MACD line is taken (i.e. 9 periods) and we call this the signal line. \n\nUsually, we plot the difference between the MACD line and the signal line as a histogram. This is sort of like taking the derivative of the MACD. \n\nSo if we were to think of the market price as the position of an object, the MACD line would be related to the object's velocity, the histogram would be related to the object's acceleration. \n\nWhen you want to swing trade, you want to buy when the price is at a low point. The low point happens when the \"velocity\" (MACD) is going from negative to positive. However, because the moving averages are taken only with past data (don't know the future data), the \"velocity\" and \"acceleration\" are delayed. So by the time you know your velocity is changing, you've already missed the low point (usually by quite a bit). \n\nSo lets say we look at the \"acceleration\" plot (histogram) instead. When it crosses from negative to positive, that means that the velocity is increasing (that doesn't mean the velocity is positive, it just means it's getting less negative). So the histogram lets us know a bit sooner when the low point is happening. Even then though, you usually still miss the lowest point. However, although you missed the lowest point, you have pretty high confidence that you'll be buying at a pretty good point (but it's the price you pay for the added confidence in your trade). \n\nAs for divergence... the MACD and RSI are measures of momentum, but they tend to follow the same shapes as the price. If you look at two separate recent dips and you see the most recent dip is lower than the one before, but you see something different in the MACD line and RSI (i.e. the most recent dip is higher then the one before), it can be a sign that the price has dipped more than it really should have, so it might be a good time to buy, it has a pretty decent chance of going up. This scenario is called a bullish divergence. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xilPZgm.png",

Buy a tiny bit and see if it goes through, without trying to deposit the fiat first. Coinbase generates a withdrawal straight from your bank, which is your purchase plus their fee, and your BTC is there in your wallet at the current market price. Depositing the fiat to GDAX first can be free, but takes time and the market moves in the meantime. So Coinbase charges the premium to allow you to capture the price in time. ",
