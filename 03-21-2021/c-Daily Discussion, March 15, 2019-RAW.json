            "Text": "Two things I think make inflation attractive to world leaders:\n\nMost people don't understand it. They understand taxes, and tax rates or tax increases. They don't understand inflation, thus its a political freebie for governments to pay off debt with inflation. If they had to reduce spending or increases taxes to pay for debt it would be a political nightmare. Inflation is a silent tax. \n\nSecond, $raises$, because people don't have a sure grip on inflation they don't really know if $45k a year is more or less than $40k in 2010. Everyone knows burgers used to be. 25 cents in the 1950s and they now cost dollars, but it's abstract. However, they do know if they get raises or not, and when the last time they got one.  The voting block would riot if wages are flat (not inflation adjusted, just simply flat). Inflation gives people a sense they are moving up, making more, doing well compared to their parents, etc. A world without inflation is a world without raises unless promotion, and a world that makes comparison to the past living standards obvious. Inflation is like a lubricant that keeps everyone churning away without riot. For example:\n\n\"I got a raise, my house is worth more than I bought it for and my 401k is up this year and I didn't pay more in taxes to the damn government!\"\n\nEven if that person is 'flat' when adjusting for inflation, they are not kicking the current administration out.

In that 3 weeks from Nov 30, 2017 to Dec 18, 2017 the price of bitcoin go up from under $10,000 to $20,000.\n\nWhat do we do? C ask\n\nLet buy as much bitcoin we can and run the price to monumental value, price get to $20,000 \n\nNow let's sell the bitcoin we accumulate. \n\nSell the underline as we see it fit and short on future market from $20,000+ down to... and make as much money we can.   \n \n\nPrice go from 20000 to 6000  \n \n\nNow the price is low institution like Bakkt, ICE, Bank and all other institution buy every bitcoin they can get from people who must sell to support their life and pay bills, who happen to be the early adopter and the innovator. also due to the price drop some will give up and sell more.   \n \n\nOk but not enough. where can we get more liquidity?  \n \n\nLet control the narrative.  how?     \n \n\nlet's giving out false hope and say we will start ETF soon, when everyone focused on that and forgets the real value of bitcoin, and think ETF is the main reason why bitcoin exist, we just come out and say O no, not now. will do it several times and give different reasons.  \n \n\nwe are starting ETF O no we can't, ok now we will next month O no we just pulled out our application ok we applied again.  Get it  \n \n\nOk now it looks like everyone who is going to sell, sold already   \n \n\nLet's think about this. C ask  \n \n\nIf the price go up from this point and we can't sell the underline to control the price it will be bad for us, if someone go long in the future what can we do?  \n \n\nWE WILL NO LONGER OFFER FUTURE.\n\nI\u2019m Just speculating, Maybe the price of bitcoin goes down just because, one of the beast innovation in human history has no use.

As I have said before, they are relying on confusion with BTC to succeed; if they were their own crypto, they would avoid this confusion.\n\nThey would also be worried about (and I think they are although they don't post about it) falling a notch down on the list of cryptos -- a 10% move in the one of the two cryptos below them will make them lose position and I think in terms of being seen by funds that invest in crypto as something they are allowed to investment in, being in the top 5 or top 10 position is important.\n\nThe central idea is, moves in BTC are probably less likely to be the result of manipulation whereas far less money can be used to move the price of bcash. Indeed, I think today's move might be defensive against the two cryptos near it in value -- I doubt if they have a chance to move up to overtake litecoin or eos so they are just worried about slipping.\n\n&#x200B;",

I buy it along with real estate, stocks and other investments. I consider it a high risk category because of its nature as an investment based on unchartered territory, but also am well aware of its high likelyhood to eventually be worth many times what it is today. After seeing the obstacles it has already overcome, I am confident that development will continue and easily recognizable advantages of using and owning bitcoin will drive adoption in the years to come. \n\nIncluding bitcoin among a diverse investment strategy is wise in my opinion.

They didn't get barred for _cheating_ they got barred for _winning_. That's my point. If suddenly there is a loss of power due to bitcoin, the laws will change and a smear campaign will go against it, making it the coin of drug lords. Remember, bitcoin has no backing, and no money and therefore no ability to promote itself. There is no government to produce pamphlets or anything else. On the other hand, the US could rename it the 'coin of terror' and suddenly laws would spring up because the mob and criminals can't control it. That's my point in all of this. It doesn't matter what you or the people want, it only matters what those in power want.",
