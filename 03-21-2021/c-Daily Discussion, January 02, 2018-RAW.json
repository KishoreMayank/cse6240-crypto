Link your revolut eur account to coinbase. As another poster, this step will take a few days, unfortunately.\n\n*Withdraw your euros to the revolut account. Again, a couple of days for this.\n\n*Convert, in revolut, the eur to gbp, and then send to your bank\n\nIt sounds complicated but really isn't. Another notably different option is localbitcoins--I've never used it, but might be quicker.",

I didn\u2019t know people bought gold during a recession.\n\nWhat I was thinking though is that if most average people cashed out on their bitcoin, since they would need $/\u00a3/\u20ac more than they would need bitcoin during a recession...wouldn\u2019t that bring the price of bitcoin down to the price it was at before most average people started investing in it?\n\nBut I get your point, maybe those that are richer and don\u2019t need more $/\u20ac/\u00a3 would be buying bitcoins.
