Fear is a tremendous type of leverage. I admit willingly that I have found the last days frightening. I am not a long term hodler and the prospect of losses is daunting.\n\nI have researched a lot (here on Reddit, as well as Twitter and other sources of information). There is absolutely not the same level of 'marketing' in favour of BTC. I know that there is not a central figurehead (i.e. the equivalent of Ver) to speak out, BUT I do feel that if some of the more influential folks spoke out more it would help put folks at ease and mitigate some of the reactive trading.\n\nWhat I think (and hope) is that they are quietly working away and have no fundamental concerns themselves, but this calmness, if more clearly communicated, would help strengthen hands and reduce some of the stress. (for the record - those of you on here who show the confidence - thank you - I mean no disrespect to you by this post).\n\nWhat do you think? I feel the recent painful drop was doubtless linked to the Coinbase nonsense, which was in turn fueled by Ver's negative campaigning.",

Leaving Coinbase, what will be my best bet? I am not prepared for paper/hardware wallet, and since I am investing small amounts I prefer to remain in hot wallets. What would you suggest ?\n\n3. What is you preferred exchange ? Consider I cannot provide domestic bills or passport. I just have ID card.\n\nThanks",

This hard fork on december 28th really confuses me anyway. \n\nFrom what I've understood this fork and the new coin called b2x will address the issues of long and expensive transactions by increasing the block size. I've read that they will work and support eachother somehow, ease the work load. BUT is this not exactly the same as another Bitcoin cash?? There will be no improvements to the actual original bitcoin?\n\nMy question is: Is it possible to increase the block size of the original coin, or improve it in some other way instead of creating a fork with a new coin?\n Otherwise it feels like that coin is doomed to slowly die..\n\nObligatory \"sorry for bad grammar I'm swedish\" comment",

I had a Bittrex account and I knew that to be able to withdrawal after my trades I\u2019d need to get a \u201cBasic Verification\u201d. The problem is is that Bittrex is saying they can\u2019t find my information with public service providers. They recommend upgrading to an \u201cEnhanced Verification\u201d however that is a little to personal for my comfort. Does anyone have any suggestions as far as crypto\u2014>crypto currency exchanges that have low to moderate fees and the big one: SECURITY AND REPUTABILITY. Please let me know, thanks! ",

Also I search for segwit2x exchanges and it shows no news except the old ones which don't matter.. So everything fishy to me, I just want to know if it is happenning and will it really make Bitcoin blocks bigger and if so by how much?",

So I sold my LTC holdings on Gdax into BTC. Tried to transfer from Gdax to my Bitstamp wallet. It has been over 9 hours and the transfer is not showing up on Bitstamp, nor is it showing up on Blockchain Explorer when I search for my public Bitstamp key. I can't search for the Gdax key it was sent from because I did not write it down and Gdax changes the withdrawal key every time you click the Withdrawal button.\n\nI copy-pasted the address from Bitstamp into Gdax, I feel like there is no way I screwed the address up. But if I did, can my coin be recovered???\n\nEdit: I have support tickets in with both Gdax and Bitstamp already but am assuming those will be dead-ends for days.",

What are your thoughts?  \n\nMy strategy would be siphoning investment into the following, all of these are regarded as \u201csafe\u201d and are consistent in the top 10:\n\n-Ethereum\n-Ripple\n-Litecoin\n-Cardano\n-IOTA\n-Dash\n-Monero\n-NEO\n\nMy main worry is taking my stake out of the BTC and sacrificing gains in the long run over 2018.  \n\nMy end goal is to keep a significant amount in BTC whilst maintaining my coins and hodling for the long run.\n\nTLDR should I diversify out or keep all my BTC in one place and hodl to the moon?\n\nPs - where do you hold altcoins that are not supported by Nano Ledger S as cold storage?",

The degree to which price deflated (aside from the brief panic drop to 10k) is IMO an indication of how much of the price was from overexcitement. If Ver could pop that bubble with a little PR, maybe that means it was just a healthy correction.\n\nDon't worry about it. One cryptocoin has the foundation to be the future of money. That's Bitcoin (core). The rest are coattail riders and wannabes.\n\nEDIT: typo",

            "Text": ">Currently any of the top 20 coins works better as a coin than BTC\n\nThis is false. By your definition of \"works better as a coin\", a VISA credit card works better as a coin than *any* cryptocurrency. Can't beat those cash back reward points et al.\n\nBitcoin is currently the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency that exists. Is it Turing expressive? No, and for good reason; that would expand the attack surface immeasurably, and at-the-edge computation is fundamentally more efficient and economically sound than mandatory-and-redundant computation. Does it have a dynamic or memory-hard hashing algorithm? No, and for good reason; this doesn't actually prevent mining specialization, it just complicates it and delevels the playing field even worse, long-term. Does it have the lowest fees on-chain? No, because there is actual demand for the necessarily-scarce resource of blockspace (i.e. transaction inclusion or confirmation). Is it easy to rewrite or replace the consensus rules? No, and *that is why it is so valuable*.\n\nYou're very new here, so you haven't had time to learn about the fundamentals, and meanwhile, since we're in the peak of a hype cycle, every altcoin has a fancy sales brochure that their marketing department has been polishing for the past year or two, and you're unfortunately not knowledgeable enough (yet) to tell the \"shit from shinola\", as Terence McKenna would say.\n\nYou seem to be worrying about transaction fees, as if high fees are a *bad* thing for the prospects of Bitcoin's long-term growth, but that's a backwards perspective if you're evaluating it as an investment opportunity. Ask yourself: *why are people still paying those Bitcoin fees, even when they get so high?* Then ask yourself: *what does that imply about Bitcoin's underlying value?*\n\nDecentralized paradigms are messy and confusing, because most of the things you're used to are very centralized (and thus more understandable). You might think that \"oh look, altcoin XYZ has hard forked successfully a dozen times this year, and Bitcoin hasn't even managed to hard fork *once*, so that must mean it's better and more upgraded!\" but this actually indicates that altcoin XYZ is *not actually decentralized, and not actually immutable*, which means that fundamentally, it's *not actually valuable in any long-term sense* (at least not yet).\n\nCounterintuitive? Absolutely! But counterintuitive (yet valid) conclusions are the norm around these parts. They are Bitcoin's bread and butter.\n\n\n>gold cant be created and BTC can be forked by everyone \n\nForks of Bitcoin are *not* Bitcoin, so they don't \"make more Bitcoin\", they just copy it (and generally \"airdrop\" their coins to Bitcoin holders, like a stock dividend). Bitcoin will still only ever have 21M real coins (at most), no matter how many forks spin off from it. And in fact, each fork makes us holders (who are holding the *real* Bitcoin) a little bit richer, because we get the forkcoins for free. This (again counterintuitively) reinforces the real Bitcoin's network effect.",

Report a trade of Bitcoin for Litecoin as a sale for Bitcoin at the current market rate, then a purchase of Litecoin at the current market rate (reported whenever you sell it, just keep track of the rate from when you purchased it so you have your cost basis on-hand at time of sale).\n\nAs far as loopholes, see a tax guy.  I can't think of anything legal to get around it.\n\nAs far as just straight up not reporting it, the thing that always comes to mind for me: Not even Al Capone could escape the IRS.

            "Text": "> My question is: Is it possible to increase the block size of the original coin, or improve it in some other way instead of creating a fork with a new coin?\n\nYes and no.  Increasing the base block size means a hard fork, that does mean the coin splits into two different coins which Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin gold and I \"think\" b2x will be doing.  \n\nThe other option is to *reduce the size of each transaction* which effectively *is* a block size increase.  This allows you to fit more transactions inside each block -- the same outcome a larger block does.  The upside of this is approach is that it does not necessarily mean you have to do a hard fork.  This is what segwit does.  It moves part of the transaction off the main blockchain, allowing more transactions to fit in a block and since its backwards compatible (segwit or non-segwit are both fully valid bitcoin transactions) it did not require a hard fork.",

Some changes can be done with soft forks where old versions are still functional and others, like block size, which are done with hard forks and must be consensual because everybody has to upgrade together or a new coin will be created. And the pipeline is full of new features being developed, those can be easily googled...",

If that is the assumption that bitcoin is predominantly a stock, than what guarantees do I have?  Will it issue dividends that make it impossible to short?  Does it have underlying value due to assets that could be sold off in a bankruptcy?  No.  Does it make a steady cash flow from a business that is hard to replicate?  Sort of, there are profits from transaction fees similar to Visa.  But as an owner of bitcoin I don't get any of the profit from transaction fees.\n\nAs a stock where does bitcoin have value similar to other stocks?",

I started 4 weeks ago with 1btc and now have 3btc from day trading and catching the dips. I was just suggesting that when it rises as quickly as it has today it's usually wise to prepare for a dip. Be it selling now and buying back in or getting funds ready to simply add more to your collection. Check back here in the next 12 hours to see how much you would have benefited from my advice.",

It may take a stupid long time but it is going to move eventually, and when it does, you no longer will have a wallet with tons of small inputs. I'd say in all likelihood this will take less time than tx fees being fixed. If not, and for some reason you urgently need those coins at some point, you just pay the retardedly high tx fee with a cpfp tx or pay a miner to pass it through, whichever is cheaper. \n\n[This is less than ideal, but so was sending an email in 1984.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9a3a7d/how-to-send-an-email-in-1984) Other cryptocurrencies or bitcoin forks may have found solutions that make them better than BTC, and if that is the case, we may eventually inspire ourselves on them to fix BTC. \n\nThe development of BTC is slow and conservative compared to the overall blockchain space, but I'd say this is by design. It's no coincidence that investing in altcoins can be so much more profitable than just hodling BTC: They're also much riskier. The DAO and other security flaws are what happens with rapid innovation. \n\nIt's not just about testing the technical aspects of new concepts and ideas for blockchain technology, it's also about testing the economic side of things. Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin and it will never be Bitcoin, but what it is, is a good way to measure market demand for bigger blocks. The price of BCH is a good indicator of this demand, and it will be extremely interesting to compare it pre and post LN. If the community really does want bigger blocks, there will eventually be a consensus within BTC to change the blocksize due to the threat of a growing BCH - we'd have the Bitcoin Cash community to thank for this, and assuming they exit quickly enough, those who bet on bigger blocks by buying BCH will make good money through this. But BCH will still not be Bitcoin, and there will be no reason for it to exist if BTC also adopts bigger blocks.\n\nAltcoins may be the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is the real deal, and it will ultimately be the only truly relevant cryptocurrency as far as the world is concerned.",

As long as there is adequate replay protection (in the case of BCH and BTG and most other airdrops these days, there is) then you can spend coins on one chain but not the other.

I intended on shifting my coins all back to GDAX before the 28th but I decided against it since their adoption could take a while if it happens at all. \n\nIf any of the exchanges support it, it's gonna be on their own timeline.

The fees are what they are at this point in the game if your exchange charges you to send, thats up to you to decide. I think it makes things less painful if you have several thousand dollars in holdings as 30 bucks in the grand scheme of it all isn't a blip really. As far as wallets go a Ledger or Trezor are great hardware wallets. I would highly advise against using any sort of software wallet, too much potential for loss. \n",

They pegged the BCH price on GDAX to $8,500 and later 0.280 on the ratio before trading began. They didn't allow the public to buy or sell on Coinbase until after Roger Ver went on CNBC to trash \"Bitcoin Core\". \n\nThere were bots running on exchanges to market sell huge amounts of Bitcoin and market buy huge amounts of Bcash. These bots continued to run up until recently. \n\nI am sure I'm missing some other things here. \n\nYou can think that this sounds like some crazy conspiracy, but considering it was the 3rd time something like this has happened, I think it's very likely that it was a deliberate and coordinated attack.

Especially after BTC blew up. There are probably hundreds of thousands of Americans not paying taxes. \n\nUnless it's automated then it'll be hard to track everyone down. They would have to hire way more people at the IRS to contact people not paying their $5,000 in capital gains. It's more likely they would go after someone not paying $250,000 in capital gains instead.",

Even some people in poor health or that are homeless have great attitudes. I have a lot of work to do in this area too, but try to realize if you\u2019re relying on those things to make you happy you\u2019re probably missing a deeper happiness that can only come from yourself. Learning this about myself has helped me become a better person and find what is really important. Money can give you some basic comforts, but it will never make you truly happy. You have to try to find who you are without depending on any of that stuff for your happiness. ",

An airdrop is basically \"granting free balances on a new coin's ledger based on the existing balances of an existing ledger (or multiple existing ledgers, e.g. what CLAMS coin did)\".\n\nSince hard forks without full community consensus are completely different (and incompatible) protocols themselves, they are functionally equivalent to any other altcoin, technically speaking. The recent \"forks\" like BitCore, Cash, Gold, Diamond, the new SegWit2x, Ruby, God, etc are effectively just new altcoins with Bitcoin-based airdrops (which is why many people in the Bitcoin community don't like to use the word \"Bitcoin\" when referring to them).\n\nThere are guides like [this one](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/beginners-guide-claiming-your-bitcoin-gold-and-selling-it/) for claiming balances, and even a subreddit dedicated to such coins: /r/BitcoinAirdrops ... some of the coins have proven to be outright scams, and their \"wallets\" have included malware in them, but others are actually claimable (like BCH). As always, if you're going to be doing anything with any of these, be careful and do your research (and *never* give your private keys to any service or wallet if these keys still control an existing Bitcoin balance; that would almost guarantee a loss of funds).",

It is not (solely) a matter of marginal risk, it is a matter of trade-offs and deoptimization.\n\nThink of it this way: you can model simple arithmetical operations as incredibly-complex mathematical expressions, but that doesn't make the complex versions any *better* (or \"more advanced\") from a functional standpoint.\n\nIf I asked you for \"\u03b6(3)^(e^i\u03c0 + 1) apples\"  would you consider my request \"more technologically advanced\" than me simply saying \"Can I have an apple?\" Of course not.\n\n\"Complexity\" is *not* synonymous with \"superiority\" and this is one of those lessons that will take a lot of people a *long* time to learn (assuming they ever do). And if you make the trade-off to sacrifice decentralizability and/or economic viability in favor of complexity (as many coins most certainly do), you cannot reasonably claim that the coin has tech which is \"more advanced\" than Bitcoin's own.\n\nConsider the possibility that you may be unwittingly parroting sales brochures on this point.
