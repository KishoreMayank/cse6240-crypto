            "Text": "I honestly don't see how it could bottom out much further. If everyone who has the opinion of it going lower has sold off then who else is there to sell down the price? Some whales could come buy I guess but if they are still holding then wouldn't they want the price to go up? We hit the end of a quarter and the end of a futures contract expiration. Now I feel there is only room to go up. Plus if people are manuplicting the market they would use the low volume of buyers to quickly drive up the price no? \n\n\nThis is all specualtion. But that is how I am feeling and why. \n\nEdit: Spelling",

            "Text": "eventually whats going to happen is a mass adoption sort of thing. 98% of the rest of the world who isnt in crypto or holding any coins will be jumping over eachother when they hear the rumors of massive gains. It'll be crazy youll want to be in the markets and have your ducks in a row thats for sure. I believe we will all become millionaires fairly quickly within a few months when mass adoption happens. Timing is the key I believe it will just be astonishing when that happens. People will be tripping over eachother running to the bank with their checks to buy cryptos through fiat. By that time, we could expect popular wallets in beta at the moment such as pillar ethos and such to be fully open making it easier. I believe that will be what sparks the mass adoption phase is when cryptos get alot easier to use and purchase. When people flood in your average joe and jane things will go up ten times like last yearand I believe it when they say the next run will dwarf 2017 because the institutional money will be in and joe and jane from down the street whove never heard of crypto in their life will follow. well wake up things will be up 50-60% in a day and sh*t day in day out maybe take a dip like 10-15% then blast up another 20-30 and so on and so on. But not everybody\u2019s gonna make it big those of us already in the world will push us to the top while their scrambling to purchase high still thinking they got a good deal I can tell you ladies and gents it\u2019ll be a fun time to be alive. I believe the mass adoption phase will last for a few years in which its up to each person how long to hodl. I believe were about 5 years out from the \"flood gates opening\" do I need to say it again?? HODL HODL HOOOOODL",

The trick does not work forever, because buyers will simply wait for the next dip to buy in.\n\nin my opinion, whalers now have control of a very large amount of bitcoins and are simply trying to establish a monopolized price for the Bitcoin and the Crypto space in general.",

There is no such thing as minimum price because the market can work like a balloon with a hole in it. You can keep pumping some air into it but all you need is a tiny hole to keep it deflating. If whales own just 10% of BTC, they can continue to deflate it through buy sell walls. So, by owning even 1.7 million BTC, they can deflate the market cap down to $0.  Of course, it will never go to $0 but it is very mathematically possible.",
