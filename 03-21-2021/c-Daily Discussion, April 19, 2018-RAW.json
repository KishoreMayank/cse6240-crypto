The trendline resistance is around $8,285 currently.\n\nHowever, soon before press time, BTC was closing in on that target level and changing hands at $8,226 on Bitfinex (up 1.4 percent on a 24-hour basis). So, the next few hours are likely to determine the pattern going forward.\n\nView\n\nA high-volume break above $8,300 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a move toward $8,800 (10-week MA).\n\nRepeated rejection at the key trendline hurdle would boost the odds of a deeper pullback to $7,510-$7,200.",

Put all my savings (wasn't much - I'm still yung) in it  \u2013 because I believe in it. \n\nNow consider this a more philosphical point of view \u2013 btc helps me live in a country with very high living costs and get the best education I could dream about, even made some profit for my mom. You see it's not about cashing out, I see it more as a reserve, which could grow with all of us and in times of need you can reach out for it. No one needs luxury items, its about being financially independent/ flexible and helping others. <3 have a nice day and keep hodling <3",

That was the normal for the last 4-6 months of 2017.....\nIm not much of a trader but do traders buy back in again at a higher price in a bull market?\n\nPS I agree 100% that the price of Bitcoin will come back up, regardless of how far it drops. For 9.5 years with 100% accuracy BTC has always broke above the previous all time high price and gone way above it, over and over for nearly a decade. This recent time will be no different, in fact the run up might be even greater than the last run, because thats been a pattern too..... That give us 150k Bitcoin easy, because we ran over 2000% on the past bull run. Assume $6500 was bottom we get $130k bitcoin so I'd say we see $150k for a week but maybe touch $175k for an hour or so like the way we touched 20k for 15 minutes but 18k was the price for about a week.

            "Text": "With day trading the big thing is the trend of the market - in a bear market , unless you are shorting, no trades will win.  However , in a strong up ward bull market, it is actually hard to lose, once you get the hang of it.  The basic technique I use in an upward trend is to buy the pull back, ie. buy the dip.  This works because even in a bull market  it doesn't go straight up - it will always pull back before the next spike.  So if it is a sustained bull market, like we might be entering now, it is pretty hard to lose.  On the other hand in a bear market like we have come out of it is hard to win.  That's why traders say - 'the trend is your friend\"  ",

            "Text": "One of them in particular who said this to me the other day has been in the finance industry for years and has made a killing off stocks. Guy's probably retiring at 50-55 latest at the rate things are going. He's also the same one who advised me to sell off my Bitcoin right as it was at $17.5k. Saved me a major heartbreak there for sure. Really intelligent guy. And I do agree there is *some* merit to his thought process.  \n\nBack in Oct/Nov and after, we were coming off the China FUD and noticing many among the general public setting up new Coinbase accounts at record setting rates and buying up cryptos. Right now, it's more or less clear that many of those FOMO kiddies who pumped it to $20k aren't coming back. At least not for a while. For cryptos to go parabolic again, we need more new money and not just the institutional investor money pumps we're witnessing.  \n\nSo I'm a cautious optimist myself for now. Enjoying the pumps, but hopeful we can get the general public excited for cryptos again.",

I'm talking about a pretty decent dip of more than $300. After a larger dip it usually moves sideways for hours before recovering or dipping further. Look in the history of this and you will see I am right. Even if I was wrong one time, you will have made so much from it, it won't hurt you to be wrong that one time. \n\nEdit:\n\nJust for fun I predict we will have a Bart form here on the 5 mins chart.
