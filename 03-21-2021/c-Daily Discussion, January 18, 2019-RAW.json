            "Text": "Things are actually moving fast with bitcoin, despite how slow it may seem to many who are hoping for a price increase. I remember reading articles in 2015 that talked a lot about how universities will be teaching bitcoin courses in 20 years, and the price of a single bitcoin would be triple what it was then. Well, it's only been 3-4 years and that much has already been accomplished. Bitcoin is not a stock that represents a revenue generating business. It's about building the future, and an investment in bitcoin is a bet on that future. The sooner all the people who keep comparing bitcoin to a stock share and whine about the lack of intrinsic value grasp this, the better.",

Store of value is worth trillions. Nothing wrong with being a store of value. That maybe better than being a payment system. Gold is $7-$8 trillion. If bitcoin could get half that, we\u2019re good. \n\n$5 trillion divided by 16 million coins (due to approximately 5 million lost forever) is not a bad goal per coin. ",

And now that their respective firms may be interested in buying BTC or cryptos, even better, manipulate and suppress the price, gain yield on short positions and accumulate as prices dip lower and lower. Win-win for smart money.",
