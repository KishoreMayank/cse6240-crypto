I want it to be simple and secure and private. \n\nI'm Canadian and currently my plan is just to make a small purchase with credit or debit on Coinbase every two weeks, and then transfer to a secondary wallet. \n\nThis is something I want to do long term, and privacy and security are important to me. Is Coinbase an okay way to do this, or can someone recommend a better way? \n\nThank you",

            "Text": "this is from WSJ today's paper:\n\nFutures on the shiny metal have fallen 9.8% from their highest level of the year at the end of January, and they're down 1.7% this month alone. Gold hit a 52-week low on Thursday, underscoring the hapless state of gold investing at the moment.\n\nWhat's more, as gold has fallen, investors have ramped up bearish bets. Open interest in gold futures has been rising fast recently, according to Sundial Capital Research's Jason Goepfert. \"This suggests that short sellers are pressing their bets,\" he wrote in a note to clients last week. Typically the opposite happens when gold prices are bottoming out.\n\nGold is often associated with fearful investors whose distrust for the financial system leads them to store value in physical assets like the metal. But the recent decline is tied more closely to moves in other markets than anything else.\n\nA rise in the U.S. dollar has been a key catalyst. Like many commodities, gold tends to get hit when the greenback is up because it becomes more expensive for overseas investors to buy the asset, which is priced in the U.S. currency.\n\nAdditionally, gold tends to fall when inflation-adjusted rates are rising, as they generally have this year. When so-called real rates are up, interest-bearing assets look more attractive than gold, which doesn't offer any income.\n\nConsumer prices picked up at their highest annual rate in more than six years, Labor Department data showed on July 12. But the climb in inflation has been outmatched by rising nominal rates, a factor pushing real yields higher.\n\nGold could of course rebound, if the recent dollar rally reverses or real rates fall. Prices climbed Friday with the dollar sliding. Plus, a trade war or other unforeseen event could drive a selloff in risky markets, prompting demand for the safety of gold.\n\nBut for the moment, the outlook for gold prices is looking a bit tarnished.",
