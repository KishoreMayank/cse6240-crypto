I guess it depends on how much fake fiat there is in the world, but if the price gets over a dollar a satoshi, it's going to become an issue. That's why I'm starting to embrace certain alts, that, at a minimum act in symbiosis with bitcoin if not flat out supplement it in a fully bitcoinized world. There are some really interesting projects involving mimble wimble that I like, I was delighted to hear about the partnership litecoin foundation made with beam foundation. Mimble wimble is legit, super cool, cypherpunk shit. ",

            "Text": "Obviously it can not. The global financial system now consist of so much money that does not even exist, in any way or form. It is fundamentally impossible in the current system to settle all debt. Bitcoin is not dependent on debt, but bitcoin can be exchanged for (non-financial) goods and services. Bitcoin can be used for purchasing commodities. \n\nObviously there will become a time that there will be wide spread bitcoin derivatives (altcoins?) and bitcoin-based debt, which will bring us to a partial centralization of these things again. There will always be such a thing, because there is a market for it. It does not mean it is a good idea, but many people spend lots of money on bad ideas.\n\nThe whole stock exchange market is currently also valued in USD (or other local fiat). This makes some sense to value the 'price' of the company, but there are no 'real' dollars behind this. This is just a part of the future revenue that is expressed in a price. These things can be expressed in any currency. If you take a big international company (like coca cola), and imagine the USD drops 90% overnight. Does this mean the future revenue of coca cola drops 90%? They will feel US inflation, but a large part of their sales is international, so their future revenue will probably only drop 20% or 30%. This means that their share price, denominated in USD will go up, because USD goes down. USD is just used as a way to account for future value, but it is not 'real' money.\n\nIs bitcoin 'real' money. What is 'real' money. It can be a very semantic discussion, but the global financial system will never be replaced by a single \"unit of account\". It is not USD now, and it will not be BTC in the future. International trade is often denominated in USD, but this is not a requirement, all that is needed is both trading partners to agree on what unit of account to use and how much of this unit they will transfer for certain goods or services. The advantage of BTC is, that it is not bound to any state and by definition neutral. We will see an increased use of BTC in international trade, but this will be a transitional currency, and the trading partners will transfer this into their own fiat fairly fast. A bit further in the future, they will hold on to bitcoin, and at some point, a significant part of international trade will be denominated in bitcoin (or at least not in some kind of fiat).",
