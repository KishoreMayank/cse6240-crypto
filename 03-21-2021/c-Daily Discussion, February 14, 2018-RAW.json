            "Text": "Help needed - As part of a college course I am doing I have been tasked with trying to explain what Bitcoin is in 500ish words. I've given it my best shot below - If you could read it and help me out with anything baring in mind word count I'd appreciate it a lot . \n\n(2) Your boss asks you to send them a short report on what Bitcoin is, what do you tell them?\n\nAccording to its founder Satoshi Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that engages in disintermediation allowing users to send payments directly to each other without the use of a third party. Bitcoin is a system that removes the necessity of trusting a third party to process payments between individuals who wish to buy and sell goods online as well as providing them with the anonymity that cash purchases do in bricks and mortar commerce. The Bitcoin system replaces trust in a third party such as PayPal with the use computer technology such as a hash based proof-of-work system and cryptographic signatures.\n\nUsers of Bitcoin interact with eachother anonymously using cryptographic signature technology. If we take the example of Bob wishing to buy a product from Alice, Alice would provide Bob with her public key address to which Bob would send her an agreed amount of bitcoin from his public key address. Alice then decrypts any payment sent to her public address using her private key and at this point can send Bob\u2019s bitcoin she received on to another person as she has proved by using her private key to decrypt the transaction that she is the rightful owner of the coin now. \n\nAlice may be worried that Bob has double spent his bitcoin by also sending it to another user but this issue is solved by the way in which transactions are confirmed by the Bitcoin system. When Bob sends payment to Alice this transaction is broadcast to computers connected to the system known as nodes. Nodes collect up the transactions and group them together into blocks. Each block has its own unique identifier know as a hash which is made up of three elements \n1)\tThe Hash of the previous block\n2)\tA Merkle Tree Root- Which allows for each transaction with its own individual unique has be grouped under one hash.  \n3)\tA Nonce \u2013 Which acts as a puzzle nodes seek to solve using computational power. Because each block is made up of transactions with individual unique IDs each nonce is a different unique value.\n\nAs each block\u2019s hash begins with the previous blocks hash they form a sequential chain so that users of the system can confirm transactions based on their position in the chain. Blocks are added to the chain if 51% of all nodes in the system agree that the transactions within the block are legitimate ie the transaction are not double spending. Here Alice would be advised to wait for six blocks to form on the blockchain after her transaction has been confirmed as due to network latency transaction may be confirmed once within one block that is later be rejected by the network. \n\nNodes in the system are rewarded for correctly forming blocks that are added to the chain with newly issued bitcoin and transaction fees users attach to the transaction they wish to send. In a situation where Bob wished to reverse his payment to Alice he we need to re-do the proof-of-work done by the other nodes in solving the nonces and have control over 51% of the nodes to approve his new block in a Sybil attack. For this situation to occur Bob would have to expand an extremely amount of large computational power incurring massive costs to do so as well as rendering all of his coin worthless as the entire system could no longer be trusted meaning nobody would use it. Therefore Bob is better off using his computational power to earn bitcoin to spend then devalue the entire system . \n",

People start to invest after they get back from work.\n\nSo this means that the next 3-5 hours will be steady, quiet, not much ups and downs. After that, it's either downhill or uphill.\n\nNow although it is scary because you never know when people decide to pull out their profit, at least we know the time range at which it will happen\u2014or so I assume.\n\nGet ready for the next hit folks.",

So factor in the taxable event when making your decision.  The days of buying low, selling high, then buying low again and ratcheting up your portfolio value without recognition of the fact that each sale is a taxable event are over.  Trust me.  In the real world stock day traders deal with this reality, and all the youthful declarations about the \"unconstitutionality or immorality of taxation\" don't mean anything when you're audited or paying a tax lawyer to defend you from tax evasion charges.",

It is a bit hard to understand, yes, seeing as the subject matter is hard to understand when you get into the details that OP got into. However, for the short report that it is I think you did a pretty good job OP. Good luck! I don't have much critical advice on what to change, sorry, just thought I'd support what I thought was a pretty good summary.",

If you explained a bank account to someone, you wouldn't go into details about how deposits, withdrawals, and payments are tracked by the bank. You would explain it using everyday words that describe how it functions for the consumer, i.e. how the consumer uses the product. I think OP should do that for his Bitcoin report.",

In the U.S. the Internal Revenue Service is just waking up to crypto trading, they plan to enforce tax obligations, there will be pain in the trading community as people are caught up in the broader net.  And my advice to \"day traders\" is to hold your assets long term and let them appreciate, to add new positions as you can afford to, and shift the mentality away from active buying and selling as a wealth building strategy.  Long term traders know that giving away 20% to 30% of a fast profit to the IRS can wipe away a couple years of gains.  From my perspective the mantra Hodl is sound tax advice.",

            "Text": "You are wrong in so many counts that it's tiring.  \n\nFirst, the only relevance of Patriot Act with regards to currency is the use of it to launder terrorism.  Which is not relevant here.\n\nSecond, you over-estimate the weight of a subpoena issued by an American court.  For a non-American entity (company or person), he is not obligated to respond.  A subpoena from an American court to a non-American is as good as toilet paper.  Likewise, you (assuming you are an American) will treat a subpoena from a Chinese court the same way.\n\nThird, you over-estimate the importance of the issue where governments are concerned.  They have more important matters to resolve than a fringe group complaining about cryptos.\n\nFourth, it's not the gravity of a trade war that matters.  Rather, it's so insignificant in the grand scheme of things that it's not even worth discussing.  There is 5.3T in forex trades and a declining US Dollar - that is worth discussing.  \n\nFifth, this is a commercial matter that will be dealt in a Hong Kong court if Interpol/ICAC intervenes.  That's as far as it goes.\n\nLike a lot of people here, you are simply delusional about the importance of BTC.  ",

Yes, they can ignore the subpoena, which can then be used to trigger an investigation by Interpol.  Charges will be handled in a Hong Kong court.  All of this will take a lot of time and yes, Tether will continue to do whatever they want in the meantime.",
