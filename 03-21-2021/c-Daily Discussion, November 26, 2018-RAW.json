But let's see.\n\nPeople who claim they can continuously short Bitcoin and make money predicting its short term movements are liars and losers.  They are like the gambler who threw 3 sixes and think that will sustain.  But it doesn't.\n\nThat's why they are here: somehow trying to move the price to recover their foolish losses and help themselves.\n\nIt is impossible to predict Bitcoin movement short term; difficult to predict medium term, and long term - well, that is a matter of thoughtful long-term insight.\n\nIt's quite clear from the desperation from r/ShortyTheBearTrader 's multiple posts and sock puppets - his multiple accounts here - that he is in very deep trouble.\n\nTake it easy mate.  I'm sure you'll make your shorting losses back somehow.\n\nBumping spiteful electrons around this board won't help you though - will it? :)\n\n^(Edit: minor.  Last one.)",

            "Text": ">Bitcoin could not be shorted until the Futures market sprang into action last December, is that correct?\n\nNo, but those Futures you are referring to from December onwards are from CBOE and CME and are both cash settled, which does not involve actual Bitcoins. So unless someone opens a short position and simultaneously starts dumping large amounts of Bitcoins on an actual exchange, it should not affect the Bitcoin price in any way,\n\nBitMEX has allowed Futures trading since 2014, which are actually settled in Bitcoin.",

            "Text": "Despair is definitely in the air, but Bitcoin is not dead yet. You've been through the past corrections, so ask yourself, why are you feeling worse now than you did during the previous drops? Personally, this one is hitting me harder because the last rise to $20k was enough to really start imagining big life-changing stuff. Holders from 2011-2013 often have enough cheap coins from the early days that a $20k bitcoin could be enough to buy a house, travel the world, retire early, etc. Now, at $3.8k, many of those possibilities have disappeared. To make things worse, you didn't sell at the top so it's easy to blame yourself and question your own judgment. That's a recipe for self-doubt, anxiety, and depression.\n\nMy advice: try not to think of the BTC/FIAT exchange rate as a proxy for the true value of Bitcoin. There are a lot of big early adopters out there who can push the market down, and right now there are plenty of reasons for them to be selling. Bitmain may be dumping coins under pressure from the board as they push toward IPO. Ver/Wright/Ayre may be dumping BTC to prop up their side in the ongoing BCH/BSV war. There are likely some other larger players locking in losses to offset taxes from earlier gains. There are lots of reasons to sell that are driven by personal motives and don't reflect an underlying loss of confidence in Bitcoin.\n\nDespair comes from looking backward at what might have been. Look forward and you'll see there are a lot of good things coming for Bitcoin and blockchain in the next few years.",

There's no need for trolls to post negativity with such transparent drama if they felt it was just going to die on its own. Also, when the price drops, insecurity reveals itself as trolls who have been claiming death to bitcoin for ages get to feel better about themselves briefly as they get to kick it when it's down and hope to inflict the most damage possible while there's a weakness.\n\nTrolls are, and always have been, the lowest common denominator on any forum. That being said they also make the rest of us feel pretty damn fortunate regardless of the trivial stuff. Because no matter how bad things get, it could always be worse - you could be a troll. ",

Many are lost, some are not mined yet, and very many are just on HODL. The potential pool of buyers is not 300 million, but 7.7 billion. The buyers are not limited to $1,000, and can spend as much or as little as they want.

You have to manually open and close channels and balance the liquidity, which is a slight pain. and it is mostly still a command line interface. But all of these problems will be resolved with time and development. I'm excited to see where it will be a year from now!\n\nEDIT: go to http://www.bitcoin.cc/ there is a section with a bunch of Lightning Network links. \n",

The more that traders want to shift BTC $$ into tether, to keep it on the exchange for quick trades, the high the demand for tether. It is an alternative possibility to the easy to assume wash trading theory.",

But I guess that\u2019s how these losers get their high for the day after being crushed by Bitcoin lately. I don\u2019t care for people who FOMO or FUD all the time...I respect people who remain objective not respond emotionally to the current state of Bitcoin. That\u2019s why you can see me buy or sell Bitcoin both when it\u2019s doing well and when it\u2019s performing poorly. On the longterm, I certainly long Bitcoin.

When we get here then it's basically just another bank and defeats the object.\n\nDeflation will be its only card left to play, and while it's a good 1, why would people spend a deflationary asset. While central banks could crush all crypto on a whim of that orange fella.\n\nSo we're back to store of value, sure a 5 year saving plan of bitcoin might pay off, it might not.\n\nI think there are plenty greater fools out there and people have short memories so bullrun around 2022 I guess *based on nothing*\n\n\"I know BTC will be the future its not going to be a currency but it will be used by all counties.\" Please clarify this if its not a currency what is it exactly?",

More adoption will not make it less volatile, and it does'nt matter how volatile it is people invest in what they think they know about. If less volatility had anything to do with it everyone would take their money out an put it into a savings account and earn .00001% a year. The problem is transactions, right now BTC cant compete with the banks and thats whats hurting it. Another problem is people dont know what they are getting into when they get involved with crypto's and when they see those big ass dips they get scared and leave.

Take this guy, for example, with BTC declining steadily and near the year's lows, he apparently thinks that somehow the shorts lost money. He doesn't know enough about basic finance to understand that is not realistically possible for a consistently declining asset, but somehow in his mind it happened. It's sad, really, like my pool guy who thought he was going to get rich on BTC too, but now will not even mention it when he comes by. Darwinism of the Financial Kind.

Think about it ... if you were gullible enough to sell your bitcoin because of spamming posts from a user like that, how much bitcoin do really own?

That\u2019s one of the main selling points for BTC and why its price will most absolutely be manipulated in the future. \n\nIf crypto does get adopted, I personally think BTC will become a SoV (Though in its current state it\u2019s a poor one).",

I took several mechanical engr classes as required (dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics). Probably forgot all that shit today and I don\u2019t identify as a nerd but your name sounded very engineering-like (vectors I recall in calculus 3 and physics...and volts the circuits class they made us take for no reason). Sometimes I wish I bought Bitcoin back in 2010 instead invest heavily into an Engineering degree graduating in 2008 and being the biggest regret of my life. Sure I make a decent salary as an engineer today but the career path has become so convoluted (most engineering graduates not working as an engineer today). Sorry to rant but that\u2019s just my take having studied engineering for 7 years (bachelors and masters).",

It took the internet about 30 years from the 60s to the 90s just to make it into the first few homes as a slow dial up service after it was criticized and ridiculed as being useless for years. Even with today's fast pace, it will take generations for bitcoin to become the global accounting ledger of worldwide financial transactions. But one thing you can absolutely count on - bitcoin development will not slow down. Think about the exchanges, apps, proposed etfs, bakkt, lighting network, sidechains, YouTube channels, advancement in mining tech, etc. And this is just the beginning.",

I'm no blockchain expert but any one who believes that ten years is enough time to see adoption of a new digital version of something as embedded in our society as money are technical illiterate. It will take generations. That doesn't change where Bitcoin is headed though, and there's no reason why an open source dev community would mysteriously disappear or halt their efforts just because of the market price. I guess if it got catastrophic and the majority of miners exited, then there would be less to roll out  improvements and test under a live scenario, sure.

That's an extremely bold prediction.\n\nIn my view bitcoin will sink below 1k and once it does it will probably not ever go above 2k again after that point.   20k+ is exceedingly unlikely.\n\nBut that's fine, that would actually be healthy for bitcoin if it could find a stable price point and lock in there for years.   It is better overall even if it doesn't have the side effect of making you rich.",
