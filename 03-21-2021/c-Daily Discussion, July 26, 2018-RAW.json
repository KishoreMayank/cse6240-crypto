I can see it having its advantages within black market transactions. I can see the technology, itself, having all kinds of real world applications. What I don't see is value in Bitcoin. When I look at it, I see energy costs to farm and maintain the network. I see hardware costs. I see coins that can't be used to buy things nearly as easily as dollars can, or at nearly as many places. I have to use dollars to pay my taxes. I don't have to use bitcoin for anything. So to me, it seems like in developed countries you have a currency that is difficult to spend, so all you can really do is sell it out for dollars. But then, where does the value come from?  It feels highly speculative. To make matters worse, the number of new coins that will be generated will keep getting rarer. While this makes the existing coins rarer-- and adds to their value as a limited currency-- the network that is mining these coins will become heaving tested. If people aren't hitting the new coin lottery--- will they continue paying to power the infrastructure that makes bitcoin even work? I'm just not getting it, and it feels like a huge bubble.",

Should wave-e equal a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c, it would do so at around $7,958 (BITFINEX) \u2014and converging trendlines of the triangle suggest by mid to late JUL. It is common for this final wave-e of a triangle to either undershoot or overshoot the converging trendlines of the triangle. However, this wave-e must terminate below wave-c for the overall triangle to remain valid; i.e. below the MAY high of $9,990 (BITFINEX). Summary of targets to complete the triangle (BITFINEX):\n\nTextbook:\n\n     @7873: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 50% of wave-d\n     @7958: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c    \n\nOvershoot:\n\n     @8372: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 61.8% of wave-d\n     @8557: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.786% of wave-c \u2014REACHED WITHIN $50\n     @9084: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 78.6% of wave-d\n\nOnce the triangle completes, the second leg, and most devastating leg, of the cryptocurrency bear market is expected to resume with a breakout in volume and volatility \u2014the crash redux. Taking out $7,330 may commence the second leg of the bear market, at which point signals time to exit ALL cryptocurrencies.\n\nInitial expectation for the second leg bear market is towards $4,257 (BITFINEX).\n\n\n\n____\n**^https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/913xx6/2018_cryptocurrency_crash_elliott_wave_redux**\n\n^#10kNeverAgain, ^#9kNeverAgain\n",

            "Text": "A good chunk of the value is likely speculative. However, there are reasons for Bitcoin to have value: \n\n1) Trust. How Bitcoin works is understood. It's open source, and transparent. There are some people who don't trust their governments with currency (due to inflation, for example, as you mentioned). There are other people who either don't trust (or prefer not to trust) their governments, or are concerned about the possible actions of future governments.\n\n2) Global. Bitcoin is an international (or perhaps supranational) currency. Most currencies can only really be used by people within the political area of origin, and perhaps a few small surrounding places. There are places that accept Bitcoin throughout the world, which may gradually increase. If you're well off, and like to travel, imagine being able to head to any country without having to worry about exchanging money, without having to worry about carrying cash, with money that you can cross borders without any hassle because you are carrying it in your head.\n\nThe global nature of it also makes it ideal for sending remittances to family members in other countries.\n\nIt allows people anywhere in the world to set up a store and accept internet payments without having to use paypal or credit cards - sometimes those options aren't available.\n\nRegarding your final point about mining, the mining difficulty adjusts. That means that if people no longer find it profitable to mine and stop mining, the difficulty adjusts to maintain one block roughly every 10 minutes. Large swathes of miners could shut down and the system would still function, it would just cost less for malicious people to try to take over through a 51% attack.",

There is nothing that inherently requires that the network use as much power as a small city. This is currently the case because the competition is so fierce to get BTC. I totally expect 50% or more of the mining chips out there to go dark at some point. And that will be fine. The security of the network only requires decentralization, it doesn't actually have any requirement on a specific amount of hash rate or power usage.\n\nAs for the value of BTC, yes it is currently highly speculative. The world is definitely not ready to switch over to BTC as its primary currency, and BTC is not ready for that either. I expect it to continue a slow burn, increasing adoption where it makes sense. It is already the cheapest and fastest way to wire money, internationally or otherwise. Its pseudoanonymous nature also makes it pretty much ideal for paying for services online. Not because of its users trying to do shady shit, but now because of online retailers being the shady ones. How many data breaches has your information been exposed in? What if you could pay for things without entering in all your real information just to make a CC payment?\n\nI hope you see my points, but maybe BTC isn't for you yet. It's coming though, and it might be worth looking into while you can take advantage of its rapid growth. ",

I can see the technology, itself, having all kinds of real world applications. What I don't see is value in Bitcoin. When I look at it, I see energy costs to farm and maintain the network. I see hardware costs. I see coins that can't be used to buy things nearly as easily as dollars can, or at nearly as many places. I have to use dollars to pay my taxes. I don't have to use bitcoin for anything. So to me, it seems like in developed countries you have a currency that is difficult to spend, so all you can really do is sell it out for dollars. But then, where does the value come from? It feels highly speculative. To make matters worse, the number of new coins that will be generated will keep ge\n\nIt's understandable that it is difficult for you to see the value if you are used to Dollars, which is arguably the world's strongest currency.  But the vast majority of the planet uses a less strong currency.  \n\nBitcoin (or, more largely, cryptocurrency in general) brings all of the following attributes:\n\nNon-inflationary\n\nDecentralized\n\nInstant\n\nDigital\n\nCensorship Resistant\n\nPseudo-anonymous\n\n(and several others)\n\nThose qualities make BTC a better investment, and a better currency than many of the world's existing fiat alternatives.  Yes, adoption isn't at every merchant, but it is unrealistic to expect it would spring into mass adoption instantaneously.  It is, however becoming more understood and respected as time goes on as a result of those aforementioned qualities.\n\nBitcoin will start be eating the edges first... weak currencies like the Bolivar, or the remittances market....  and as those use cases become proven, it will gain strength and become adopted in maybe  middle of the road currencies and a merchant preferred currency.\n\nSupporters here think those trends are likely to continue, and they seek to profit by holding quantities now (and continuing to educate people about the benefits).\n\nBy the way, all the costs you mentioned are already paid by the users of BTC (maybe a few cents for a transaction)  Those costs are very much intentional, and work to secure the network against fraud.\n\nBTC is not yet ready to handle the worlds currency needs, but it is growing, and for some people, they see an opportunity to get in ahead of the masses.",

First you have to understand that Bitcoin's intrinsic value and its market value are two different things.\n\nBitcoin's intrinsic value cannot be accurately determined. The work the miners provide is absorbed in there somewhere, as is the ability to move money without answering to a bank or government. But do they add up to the market value? I suppose that is subjective.\n\nYou mentioned crime. I think it is important to mention that not all crime is bad, and not all government is benevolent. \n\nBlack market demand is still demand, and many of us see that as a good thing for Bitcoin. You may think Bitcoin removing the power of governments to seize money is a bad thing. It certainly sounds scary from the statist perspective. But please look around and through history and see all the horrible things governments can do. Virtually all serious atrocities have been committed by a violent state with unchecked centralised military power. The Armenian genocide. The Holocaust. Tiananmen Square. All the shit Israel and Palestine have done to each other.\n\nThe environmental concerns aren't really useful to talk about when determining value. So while the concerns may be legitimate, just like in the \"real world,\" if there is money to be made, someone will be there to make it.\n\nHope that answers some things.\n",

Besides being the most widely adapted and popular digital currency, what can it really do that's so much better than every other cryptocurrency? Whats the secret sauce that some other currency can't just come along and do better or more efficiently? As for the decentralized stuff-- I again see this being a huge strength (and probably a backbone) for why these currencies might be very useful in a global scale. But for larger nations, couldn't a government simply ban business from accepting the currency and/or shutter local exchanges? I can understand the huge strengths of using block chain and the ledger scheme of bitcoin, but couldn't local governments make using the coin such a pain in the ass that they could effectively kill its value within that region? What about its wild value swings? I'd think that would make doing business with the coin a huge nightmare when currency needs to flow and can't just be stored hoping that the value with increase, or at least stay the same. I am sorry, because asking all of these questions I'm sure that I can coming off as a detractor...  That isn't my intentions. I'm just not comfortable putting my money into something that I don't understand, but I also feel like its foolish not to ask questions and gather information on investment options before deciding on a potential investments risks and rewards really are. I appreciate every single reply I've gotten, and I wanted to thank everyone for taking the time out of their days to help me understand all of this. So-- Thanks!",

(The system works so the cheapest offer is the next one that gets sold) So this \"whale\" is basically controlling the market and putting prices by just blocking everyone else.\n\nI'm actually really new to this, so don't mind me at all, I'm just excited about learning about how the market works!",

But it's also one of those things that really makes me sit back and question the entire thing. Gold has value because it can be used in jewelry and in electrical components. Most other metals have value for their ability to be used in tools and components. Oil, Gas-- energy. The Dollar has nothing to back it up-- but almost all oil is traded in US Dollars- which gives them their value. Most fiat currencies have value because you have to pay your taxes using that nations currency. If you want to do business in that nation, you're going to need that nations currency. Bitcoin doesn't have any of these traits. It's value is only driven by the fact that it is limited-- and by supply and demand. But, I am still learning about Bitcoin, so maybe I'm missing something completely.. I don't know. So is my understanding a fair statement?",

It's the shift in that allocation that people refer to when they say that adoption will increase the value. Bitcoin is pretty much as volatile as it should be during this extremely early stage. Its value is being determined as its uses are being experimented with in a small niche environment. It's growing, evolving and thriving. All you need to do is look at how the entity itself has already changed in this past 10 years. Now continue the story for another 10 years. It's continued growth is near inevitable as a global entity of currency and value store that simply can not be stopped any more than torrent file sharing can be stopped.
