            "Text": "Many were sceptical at 6k because a capitulation event had not yet taken place. Now perhaps the sharp decline and rise in high volumes may be just that. But you may well ask: Why did so many think that only after a very sharp decline and rise could a full recovery happen? I mean why couldn't recovery just have happened after 8k or 6k without needing one event of a very sharp decline? Here is my take on it:\n\nTwo things happen on a very sharp decline like last week:\n\n1. Many who bought at high prices and were increasingly frustrated by the declines reach their threshold of frustration and sell off. They get replaced by new buyers who have bought at a low price. The new buyers are much less likely to want to sell off on further rises during recovery than the earlier ones who would be eager to recover some of their lost money. \n\n2. Long time hodlers who have a very sizeable stack bought years ago at low prices may have been sitting on a fortune at the peak and as the price declines, some may have the fear of losing all their gains which changed their life. Although they are seasoned hodlers, at some level, it becomes a very difficult choice to come back to a day job or retain what is still a decent amount of money. Infact we all saw one example of such a person last week on this forum who saw his wealth reduced from 2 million to 400k and thus ended up selling his stash on Sunday.  So the net effect is that a sizeable number of bitcoin that were held by few individuals suddenly gets distributed amongst many small buyers who were nibbling away at the order book at lower levels. This helps bitcoin become more distributed.\n\nA more distributed bitcoin is a state that can sustain much higher prices because individual buyers are less susceptible to then be able to dump large amounts. \n\nBut there is no way for Bitcoin to reach a more distributed state without a shakeout of a capitulation event that forces, via fear,some large hodlers to dump their coins. \n\nA few people's loss thus becomes the gain of the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole and therefore after the shakeout of last few days, any price we now see is a much more healthier and more sustainable price than when we saw the same price prior to this dip event.",

If all the people moving around the bitcoin market  were just as optimistic, all the bitcoin problem  would cease to exist.Unfortunately as I have already said in my previous comments  the market moves with the goal of profits  and profits derive from the losses of other people. When we were at 4400 (-2000 form the stable value of 6400)  I warned that stop losses were not triggered and a new minimum would arrive and I was right we touched 3500.  Today I have a more optimistic view of price trends and hopefully the price of bitcoin will go up probabily around 4200 / 4400. Anyway 3500 is not the price that TA indicates as the bottom. The whales will push even further down the price in the future  for this we must be ready to suffer before seeing our jewel come back to life!",

            "Text": "Ive come to the conclusion that HODL is total bullshit especially after watching this video.  I'll always have a long term stash of BTC with a time horizon of at least 3-5years from now, but once we get back over 10k, Ill be taking profits here and there and buying only if theres major corrections.  \n\nBig money controls this market just like stocks.  They long/short it with leverage up to the wazoo.  There are ppl absolutely \"Controlling\" this market.  Long term i sincerely believe bitcoin will hit at least 50k+ but its no fun having to hold through a potential 1-3 year bear market when you had awesome profits.  \n\nSo I guess my point is I'm no longer a Newbie.  I have idealist views on the future of crypto, but the Money Gods like to kill ppl - sometimes literally by financially ruining ppl (not talking about myself , but i did over invest Lol).  Its a game of stealing money.  Pump it up, get new money in, and then steal it, rinse and repeat but TIME is the problem for normal investors.  Their decisions and games have a huge impact on the daily lives of ordinary ppl and its not ok.  \n\nThe SEC and CFTC are total bullshit.  Everybody is out to eat you.  It doesn't matter if you Believe in Bitcoin or Ethereum, they don't give two shits.  The Big Money players have ALL THE MONEY.  Mike Torntare(CBOE) admitted this yesterday too at consensus.  He said YOU need institutions cause WE have ALL THE MONEY.  \n\nAnyway, if you are new to Bitcoin , this is for you.  Even though you are a long term believer and think Bitcoin is going to the Moon (I agree), there can be short term set backs that take years to recover from.  So once your money doubles or triples, make sure to take some off the table or you'll have to learn the hard way like me!  Good luck everybody and it looks like next year will be strong...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI",

            "Text": "Price likely lost steam because of the news that is spreading about the US Treasury sanctioning addresses.  There is a lot of time spent around here trying to push FUD and stifle adoption but this is the real deal.  We have been talking about what would happen if the government did this since Bitcoin started and now we are here.\n  \nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556\n  \n>646. How do I block digital currency? \n  \n>Once it has been determined that your institution is holding digital currency that is required to be blocked pursuant to OFAC\u2019s regulations, you must ensure that access to that digital currency is denied to the blocked person and that your institution complies with OFAC regulations related to blocked assets.  Institutions may choose, for example, to block each digital currency wallet associated with the digital currency addresses that OFAC has identified as being associated with blocked persons, or opt to use its own wallet to consolidate wallets that contain the blocked digital currency (similar to an omnibus account) titled, for example, \u201cBlocked SDN Digital Currency.\u201d  Each of these methods is satisfactory, so long as there is an audit trail that will allow the digital currency to be unblocked only when the legal prohibition requiring the blocking of the digital currency ceases to apply.  The institution is not obligated to convert the blocked digital currency into traditional fiat currency (e.g., U.S. dollars).  Blocked digital currency must be reported to OFAC within 10 business days.  Questions about whether a transaction should be blocked should be directed to OFAC at 202-622-2490 or ofac_feedback@treasury.gov. [11-28-2018]\n  \n",

Bitcoin (15%)\n\nWhat this signifies is the little demand for this coin. So Cardano has the shortest buy walls because nobody in their right mind wants that shitcoin which is why it\u2019s the number 1 gainer. Nothing changes about Cardano, it\u2019s still followed by the no. 2 shitcoin lately which is Litecoin. Bitcoin is no. 5 but considering its reputation, being no. 5 gainer of the day is commensurate among the 10 list. Basically my synopsis is the biggest gainers aren\u2019t the most in demand, they\u2019re the least in demand. They have the biggest gains because their sell walls are non-existent. The biggest gainers are a reflection of the biggest shitcoins. Though, Bitcoin is certainly not a shitcoin. Just food for thought. ",

Bitcon network is a  P2P (peer-to-peer) network, where every peer is equal, and is kinda basically both server and client at the same time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you run bitcoind daemon, or btcd daemon, or whatever other implementation, you are running fully-verifiable Bitcoin node, that checks (and collects) every transaction and block, and forwards valid ones to other nodes you have connection with.\n\n  \nYes, in addition to peer services (providing blocks and transactions to others), it also has RPC interface designed to be accessed by yourself (don't allow others to connect to it!), to inspect blockchain and manage your wallet, if you have one  created on the same node.  \n",

So as more people continue to treat it as a store of value, the price will rise over time (demand > supply).  Millions of bitcoins have been lost forever by irresponsible owners. So the max available supply is really a lot less than 21 million.   Thus, it is no wonder pundits like Tim Draper are making predictions that bitcoin is likely to be $250,000 per coin by 2022. ",

Transfer your funds there then it's just hiding your seed words. If you know someone stable you can write them down. Put some plastic tape over the ink to seal it and stash them in a wall or something. If you don't you can engrave the words into a piece of aluminum or something. Wrap that in plastic and then bury it somewhere. If you can make multiple copies of the seed and hide them very well. If you're facing less than 5 years you probably want to just turn yourself in at some point. It's either that or you're going to have to get a new identity and meet the right people on the dark web. If you do that you have to be even more careful because if you open a bank account under a fake name while you have a warrant out you can be in even more trouble.

He takes payment in other coins which I personally was amazed at. \n\nWe had to the chance to talk to Him after a talk, and discuss why he stays silent and he said he\u2019s a Pacifist. We respect that!! \nBut he is the best advocate for bitcoin, for decentralized bitcoin 1mb blocks. \n\nThe other spokespersons are screaming louder and getting attention and we are worried they\u2019ll come out ahead after the dust settles in 10 years and we just get another internet with government surveillance. It\u2019s already happened with \u201cchainalysis\u201d which exposes every user more than ever now which is not useful in fully banked country. \n\nI heard Greg Maxwell\u2019s speeches in 2013-14 where he said Privacy was the most important over scale and we all agreed. Other technology has surpassed us with privacy. The darknet, where bitcoin was actually used for something rather speculators/HODLers, at least stopped using bitcoin cause it so easily traced. He may have avoided adding CT and Schnorr that have been discussed for 2 years but not implemented due to government pressure but we\u2019ll never know. We just see other technology being used while bitcoin is still under 50% Segwit adoption which was the cause of the 8/1/17 hardfork. With out Segwit, Lightning can\u2019t work. \n\nI have personally given these best devs the benefit of the doubt and know they must be under pressure from all directions that I\u2019m patient to the point I don\u2019t expect to use the full potential but my kids will cause the no matter how slow and pressure these devs are under, the technology is out there and the future devs will speed up the technology and / or the pressure that holds back certain features will be lifted in a friendlier Government. States in the USA are already starting to accept bitcoin for taxes. Maybe all it takes is 1 or 2 states in the richest country to allow all these features be brought out and used. I hope. Canada is on board but USA runs it all. \n\nImplement Segwit 100%, Schnorr etc.... just have \u201cpublic relations\u201d for lack of better word, explaining what\u2019s ahead and why delays and who is who, and stop making the users confused. They know you are the smartest and best devs in the entire crypto industry, they deserve some respect that they want to use your technology and trust you. Devs in bitcoin could destroy every shitcoin if they just spoke (however uncomfortable they are) to the users of their technology. It\u2019d be great. Greg isn\u2019t a public speaker (we know painfully well) but he could communicate via others methods he likes rather disregard his users who respect him immensely. ",

But if you look at progress in itself, there does not seem to be a limiting factor.\n\nComputers/CPUs may reach silicone limitations at some 7nm or less even, but *\"computing capacity\"* can still increase exponentially, even if some part of it reached it's limitations (example, HDDs/SSDs).\n\nI would also like to argue that today is very different from the past and the difference is internet. There are some properties or effects of this level of communication that allows exponential (looking) growth to spark from anything and much faster than ever.",

That bitcoin can perform those same functions more efficiently and securely without the same weaknesses.  It gives them a real-world example of how tokenized assets could be incorporated into their daily lives.",
