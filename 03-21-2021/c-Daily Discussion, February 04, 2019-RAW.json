A break above $3,450 would confirm a wedge breakout and expose key resistance lined up at $3,658 (the high of the gravestone doji candle created on Jan. 26). A violation there would expose the psychological resistance of $4,000.\n* The prospects of a falling wedge breakout would weaken if the cryptocurrency suffers a channel breakdown on the 4-hour chart.\n\nThe slow drip bitcoin (BTC) price sell-off seen over the last six weeks has produced a bullish pattern on the daily chart.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently down more than 20 percent from highs above $4,200 seen on Dec. 24. The pullback may have reinforced the primary bearish trend, as represented by the long-term moving average studies.\n\nStill, all is not lost for the bulls, as the lower highs and lower lows created over the last six weeks have converged, creating a downward sloping cone or a falling wedge on the daily chart.\n\nThe falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern, that is, the price will often break above the upper edge of the pattern and rally. A breakout, if confirmed, could open the doors for a strong corrective move.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.66 percent drop on the day. The falling wedge resistance is seen at $3,450.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on link above.** ",

That makes the average fee is only 25 cents per transaction. \n\nThere's also the overhead for much further improvement on top of this again. Honestly, I'd say this will continue to improve along with all the other bitcoin developments for years to come. Remember we are in extremely early days. The lightning network is a second layer over the bitcoin network, and lets people transfer Bitcoin instantly and without any fees. It creates payment channels between the users.  Imagine the endless possibilities of a payment system that can reach anyone instantly with no overhead. What has happened over recent years with audio and video streaming will likely happen to money. Streaming money! \n\nRemember, one of the main advantages that bitcoin brings us is to use money as routable digital content. The future of money is being built, and one only needs to look around at the past and the present to realistically envision the future of bitcoin.",
