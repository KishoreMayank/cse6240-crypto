When it didn't get confirmed I figured it would just timeout after two weeks, but it and 0.02341384 is still stuck in limbo. I sent it from a Ledger Nano (with Segwit), and now the entire 0.02341384 is missing from my Ledger. The Ledger itself doesn't show the sent transaction, but the total amount in it is missing the total amount in the transaction [here](https://blockchain.info/tx/490d7622c748433eeda1adf4a1d71d59acb881e3a8f4c7c215a54a48054b7e60?show_adv=true).\n\nCan anyone explain how I might do a parent pays for child or something similar using a Ledger?",

            "Text": "I find it interesting how everyone thinks Bitcoin's price is so unpredictable, lets look at the last few corrections.\n\nWe just went from 19,800 to 14,800, 25% correction.\n\nBefore that we went from 17,000 to 13,000, 24% correction.\n\nThen before that, it was 11,300 to 8,000, 23%.\n\nLook, the bus sometimes needs to turn around to pick up more hodlers, but the destination hasn't changed. Yes BC H can convince the weak hands that this is the flippening, like they did during 7,700 to 5,400, but at least we got some entertaining youtube videos out of it of people saying how badly they were duped from that BC H pump and dump.\n\nDon't fall for the lies and the fud, this is normal, the weak hands will always go to another coin, it just so happens it was bch this time, but they'll be back after they are full of regret.\n",

            "Text": "I've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop. The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT). If you spend $1000 on NXT today, during the airdrop at the end of the week you will receive $1000 in IGNIS.\n\nThe math on that: 2 NXT costs $2.20. The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.\n\nI do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.",

Nothing big, just $100 AUD with the intention of giving $20 each to my neices and nephews for Christmas (printed each a fancy colour A4 paper wallet in a plastic sleve with a flap protecting the pk from obligatory social media present haul photos).\n\nIs transfering $20 to each wallet even worth it given the fees and the amount of time it could take to process? I was thinking of giving them the empty paper wallets (letting them know they're emply of course!) and if they really wanted to use the 0.001 BTC then I would just give them the greater of $20 or equivalent value. (They're only 10, 5, 4, 3 and 9 months so I doubt they're in a hurry to spend).\n\nTyping this is giving me The Human Fund/Festivus flashbacks.\n\nI gave them silver bullion coins a couple of years back thinking that would greatly appreciate.

What would happen if a (or all) government(s) decided to make the trading and usage of Bitcoin illegal? I know they cannot physically touch the Bitcoin network (as in freeze accounts and what not), but would that cause a crash that we won't be able to recover from or what? How would we go about this? Thank you :)",

Thanks to everyone who replied!\n\nThere's a catch and I need advice. I'd like to buy at a dip (doesn't particularly matter if at the current one or later) and take back out the 150 bucks when it hits a high. Mainly because we need at least a tiny emergency fund for the upcoming 2 months (im in europe btw). Depending on how we solve our current situation im either going to keep and hodl what was made from the 150 bucks, or also keep and hodl and put some disposable cash into btc. \n\nHow fast can I get the money out? In terms how fast can the transaction go? I do have a credit card.\n\nAlso, if anyone would recommend a particular service that is worldwide/open to eu/etc, would be great. I've been looking at the list generated by the website from sidebar or faq and so far i havent really picked anything. Been favoring Kraken, kinda.",

They released not only the coins but started trading on their exchange yesterday with no notice, until the exchange couldn't handle it and everything crashed.\n\nI personally was annoyed because they allowed limit sell orders to show up for hours that were well above market value, giving incentive for people to buy on other exchanges thinking they could arbitrage.  I also expect a lot of this to sort itself out once trading actually begins and people are allowed to sell on GDAX.  I am expecting a ton of Bitcoin users to dump their BCH as soon as trading starts.",

I think LN is much needed, and if implemented well will create huge gains around BTC.\n\nEveryone is so worries about BCH right now, and while I applaud their community for trying to male Bitcoin better, i can agree to disagree about their methods.  It was barely ober a month ago I watches BTC go from 8k to 5k and back in a matter of days.  \n\nEdit; my typos make me lool drunk but I'll leave tjem for your entertainment.

Happy to have gotten out at 3650. Today is a very exciting day to be watching charts \n\nIf and when Coinbase opens up purchasing, I wonder how they plan to avoid the massive ramp up in price due to an influx of market orders (and by massive ramp up I mean a user hitting purchase when it's at 3800 only to have their order filled at 5k+). I imagine that's what happened last night..",

It would be extraordinarily irresponsible of a charity to hold onto something like Bitcoin instead of immediately selling it (remember, they get to avoid any capital gains as a charity) and spending it on their charitable mission as soon as possible. A charity is not supposed to be a cryptocurrency hedge fund.",

I also bought a home around the July 2012 bottom for 75K and now I could easily sell it for 130-135... but my gf doesn't want to move in with my mom and does not want to do an apartment again.  Meanwhile it's been perfectly ok for her single mom sister to shack up with us for the past 6 months while she doesn't work and earns a little babysitting money here and there.  I had to install a solid core door just to watch tv with subtitles on after 11.  Sit on the sidelines and homes will drop back down in 2-3 years after this next fed bubble bursts... save enough for a nice down payment; 20-25K.  Pay off debts next.  Then gamble with the rest.  Good luck.",

            "Text": "> This order may fill at a price less favorable than the stop price. Are you sure you would like to continue\n\nA stop order becomes a \"market\" order once the stop price is hit.  In other words, it sells the asset immediately at whatever price you can get.  If the price is cratering, that means the sale could happen at a lower price than the stop order if the price continues to fall in the seconds or milliseconds it take for your order to match a buyer and execute.   (it could also sell for more if the price instantaneously rebounds, although that's pretty rare).  So, if your stop is at 3000, but there is a flash crash immediately down to 1000, your sale will execute at 1000.  \n\nIn contrast, a \"limit\" order is triggered as soon as your price is hit but will *ONLY* execute if a buyer is found at your limit price.  Thus, if your limit is at 3000 and there's a buyer for 3000 then it will trigger.  The risk is, also with a quick sudden drop, that there are not buyers at 3000 when your limit is triggered (because they're all at 1000).  That means your limit won't trigger and you'll continue to hold the asset.  It also means it might not trigger if you go from 3005 to 2995.  ",

            "Text": "1) Not really. You can buy ASIC miners or GPU clusters, but good luck competing with the big guys\n\n2) You need ASICS or GPUs, and an absolute massive amount of hashpower. It goes ASIC > GPU > CPU.\n\n3) In your own wallet (memorizing or storing your own private keys). However right now, with BTC specifically, fees are so high that ironically the smart people are storing their coins in exchanges like GDAX. It's a sad situation.\n\n4) When you convert BTC to cash, you must pay capital gains in the US. I have no idea about the UK, but assume it's similar.\n\n5) Fairly easy to buy/cash out, exchanges can go down during high volume however. You have to pay a fee whenever you move bitcoins (transact). Right now the fees are insanely high ($30 on average).\n\n>As a programmer, can i use my skills to make money off crypto somehow? or finance in general (I realise this is a bit wider in scope)?\n\nThe best way would be to own a smaller coin lacking in software, then write software to improve it. You could try arbitrage but with the sketchiness of exchanges you'll likely get slaughtered.\n\n>what is the short-term future of bitcoin? how high could/will it go in 1/3/7 years?\n\nHa. That question will be controversial. This subreddit's opinion tends to be that bitcoin will keep growing exponentially in price. I used to believe that, but with the current state of the network, my money is on BTC losing to its rival fork BCH. However I own some of both.\n\n>If there was a global conflict, would bitcoin still have its \"power\"? would the bubble burst? (you'll probably say we'll have bigger concerns but if civilisation ever recovers, then would we still be using bitcoin?) what if there were EMPs involved? would we all be fucked because optical media?\n\nBitcoin will be useless in this scenario. So will USD. Think about it: would you trade someone food during an apocalypse for a number that, if you take the sha256 hash of the number, has a certain number of leading zeroes (that's what bitcoin is)? The only useful thing will be expertise, medicine, guns, ammo, food, water, etc. EMP-wise it depends. If you do the smart thing and **memorize** your private keys (memorize your seed), you will be safe against an EMP.\n\n>What is all the Bitcoin Futures/Bitcoin Cash split about, i.e. what was the intention behind it? What happens to the Bitcoins that existed pre-split? Do they all stay as \"non-aligned\" Bitcoin or do they all become Bitcoin cash?\n\nBitcoin futures and bitcoin cash are two totally different topics.\n\nI'll discuss Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe fork arose because of two competing visions for Bitcoin - one where Bitcoin is a settlement layer for (largely first-world) individuals, but almost all transactions are handled on another layer (lightning network), etc. This first vision, vision A, involves keeping the block size fixed, which keeps the # of transactions per second around 6-7. Proponents of vision A feel that increasing block size has the risk of leading to centralization of the bitcoin network.\n\nVision B involves making on-chain transactions affordable and fast by increasing the block size limit. Layer 2 solutions are still possible but are to be developed after blocksize increase, rather than forcing the second-layer solutions to be complete before letting blocksize grow. Vision B claims to be more aligned with the original vision of Bitcoin as described by Satoshi. That's my belief as well, but most here would either disagree with that assertion, or would maintain that Satoshi's thoughts are outdated.\n\nI would explain the whole big blocks => centralization argument, but I've never heard a convincing one. Suffice to say that Vision A proponents view non-mining nodes as key to the decentralization of the network. Non-mining nodes exist to relay transactions and to hold unconfirmed transactions in memory (the mempool). Vision B proponents view the miners as key to the decentralization. Miners are the sole deciders of which transactions get taken into blocks (which transactions get confirmed), so miners wield the vast majority of the power. This is why the bitcoin principle is \"one hash one vote\". If you have the majority hashpower, you can compromise the network in certain ways (double-spending, etc).\n\nThere's so much more to go into, but there's a start for you. By the way, Vision A is Bitcoin Core (/r/bitcoin), Vision B is Bitcoin Cash (/r/btc).\n\nAlso there's a chance my comment will get ******** by the **** so I'll PM this comment to you if that ends up happening.",

Futures is just wall street trading on future value of bitcoin, but not actually transferring any bitcoin in the process. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork which is now trying to take over Bitcoin by using the Bitcoin brand awareness, redirection from bitcoin.com, and people with lots of money (Roger, Jihan) who want Bitcoin Cash to take over for personal vested interests. Insider trading and market manipulation is rampant.\nThe community here acknowledges scaling is a problem, but we will resolve it ourselves, not Bitcoin Cash. If it was as simple as increasing the block size, we would have done it already. It's not a long term solution. I do not agree with the censorship on /r/bitcoin but I believe in Bitcoin. \n\nBuy the dips, enjoy the ride, don't buy into the FUD.",

THis is the same thing as using a mobile banking app where it just grants you access to the funds in your account with them.\n\nThis is VERY different from a real mobile Bitcoin wallet where the private keys for your coins are actually stored in the app.",

If the process continues the price will keep dropping until the sellers are satisfied.\n\nI did this yesterday, as I had money and wanted to buy, instead of buying at market value I set \"buy 1/5 of my money when btc is this cheap\", and when it was bought I set another 1/5 to a lower amount, and when it was bought I set 1/5 to a lower amount...\n\nSo I got more bitcoin and was responsible to stopping it from getting much more cheaper faster by taking some out of circulation.\n\nOf course, had it started going up, the \"buy 1/5 of my money when btc is this cheap\" would have never happened and I would have never managed to buy, and would have lost that value because my money would have been stuck, so doing it is risky, but buyers and sellers have direct influence on the price of bitcoin.\n\nIf your interface allows trading it should be very easy to see how this happens.",

You probably have to report any new Bitcoin you get as having a zero cost basis, but the IRS has no rules in place for Bitcoin forks.  I would certainly recommend paying something when you swap it to cash though, I plan to just treat it as having an initial cost of zero.",

However remember that the validation process can take a long time so better hurry up and make a account now, otherwise you will not have enough days to transfer funds from your bank account to your bitstamp account before the holiday (I think it will be too late now). You can deposit from credit card also, but it has a VERY high fee, so I do not recommend that.\n\nThey use SEPA bank transfer, so it takes 1-3 days to get money in and 1-3 days to get money out again.

The difference is the lightning network is coming to bitcoin. BCH just has the road map of graphene, 1GB blocks, and spreading FUD and misinformation about BTC... They seem to think the way towards a transactional currency is creating something that takes several minutes to process whilst being only a bit less centralised than visa and with fees only several times higher than zcash.",

They have attacked bitcoin before in a pump and dump scheme (pump to try and get bcash to become the main fork of bitcoin, dump when they realize they couldn\u2019t) and that was when the prices of the two were much closer than they are now. So it would seem like the founders of bcash have partnered w coinbase to capitalize on the small dip, having all the panic sellers put their money into bcash.",

On top of that said it will be open in about 30 days. \n\nSome people got excited, some people stuck with Grandpaps secret recipe and some weird kids with tinfoil hats where just holding onto the sold lemonade and not drinking it.\n\nBut Timmy opens up his stand the next day!  The line is in hysteria  (crazy) and people sell your lemonade for his knock off, store bought Strawberry lemonade! The tin foil hat kids are sitting on the ground rocking back and forth muttering HODL, HODL it seems that's all they can say now. \n\nTo make it worse Timmy told weird kid Jimmy that he was going to open early, Weird kid jimmy drives the price up for personal weird kid gain. So Timmy and Jimmy are the new kids in town but because jimmy is driving a lambo all of a sudden they suspect the inside deal.\n\nGood news though, your stand keeps getting more popular and in the panic some of the lemonade buyers gave some homeless guys a chance and turns out they might have a future in food stands.\n\nMy first Eli5, hope you could read it, all done in one pass on my phone ",

The value of that money massively decreases and the values of the goods surrounding that money increases. Today, Bitcoin is one of the goods surrounding the money being printed.\n\nEconomics 101 proves that Bcash is going to crash and remain depressed for maybe a couple days, while other things you can buy with Bcash (Bitcoin, for example) are going to become more expensive.",

Market-impacted, liquidity, and frictional costs may also contribute.\n\nAlgorithmic trading is often used to reduce slippage, and algorithms can be backtested on past data to see the effects of slippage, but it\u2019s impossible to eliminate entirely.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Think of bananas, if banana producers have a good production year, the market gets flooded with bananas and farmers can compete on price driving the price down. Bananas get cheaper for everybody.  Price goes too low, farmers start grinding their crop into the ground with dozers to reduce the supply.\n\nThis is newly printed money in the form of bcash entering the market for the first time ever. Today, supply of circulating bitcoin remains the same, but the supply of circulating bcash increases by many thousands of coins.\n\nOn the markets today, you are going to see the digital version of the money printing and inflationary disaster that happened in Venezuala.\n\n(keep in mind this price depression won't last and bcash will correct upward in the next week - at a price closer to where its fundamentals put it.)",

There is no other cyrpto pair besides BTC.  I'm guessing this is going to cause a fair big surge in BTC, which will likely be followed by a sell off of BTC into other alts.  Some will stay in BTC so it should maintain some of those gains, but if you want to max profit probably best to jump on board with LTC, ETH, or XMR.",

The lowest colored stripe is for transactions that pay the lowest fee. Higher fee transactions are stacked on top of it. Since miners prefer high fee transactions, a new block usually only removes the top 1000 kB from the queue. If a colored stripe persists over several hours without getting smaller, this means that transactions paying this amount of fee are not confirmed during this time, because there are higher paying transactions that take precedence. If a stripe on the bottom chart is much bigger than on the top chart, the transactions are larger than the average.\n",

            "Text": "> That's the fiduciary responsibility of philanthropy - to maximize the fund raising.\n\nGood luck arguing that investing in cryptocurrency passes the fiduciary standard for a non-crypto-related charity... Most investors or financial experts would advise against even touch crypto, much less it being such a non-controversial good idea that it can hope to meet the fiduciary standard, the highest possible standard.\n\n*Accepting* cryptocurrency if the expected gain exceeds the distraction and transaction costs, absolutely. If a big donor wants to donate via crypto, certainly one often wants to work with them especially given the tax implications, no different than if they were donating stock shares or something. *Holding* enormously volatile assets which could easily go to zero is totally different! A charity is not supposed to be a cryptocurrency hedge fund speculating on future bubbles, and holding fiat (or more realistically, money market or bonds) is not remotely comparable.",

            "Text": "Coinbase is insured from hacks, plus they keep majority of coins offline in cold storage. The only way you lose your coins is if YOUR account gets hacked, which is possible.\n\nIf you put your coins in their vault there's a 2 day wait to transfer/send them out and you set up 2 e-mail addresses to confirm the transfer and Google Authenticator before the transfer even starts. And you're given numerous opportunities to cancel the transfer during the 2 days. So someone would have to hack your Coinbase account, hack both gmail accounts, and have physical access to your phone.\n\nAll that aside, after recent events with Coinbase I have lost a lot of my faith in them so I'll probably be moving to a hardware wallet soon.",

They also view discussion of BCH as \"against consensus\" since they define the idea of consensus in a way that excludes anyone else. In short they like to talk about decentralization and freedom but they can't walk the walk.\n\nHere's a comment of mine that was ******** earlier today:\n\n>Dump at your own risk. Holding on to your forked coins is a great way to insulate against risk between BTC/BCH.\n>full disclosure: BCH supporter, began converting BTC to BCH a week or so after segwit 2x got buried. Still have some BTC which I kind of regret because I can't even move it around right now.\n\nIt was silently removed so I didn't get a justification, but presumably they consider it altcoin discussion or some other bullshit.\n\nIf you thought it was weird that /r/btc is basically the BCH subreddit, that's because /r/btc was created in response to ********** before the great forkening ever happened. Now we're happily enmeshed in a destructive civil war that will probably lead to massive loss of value on both sides as smart money flees into alternatives that aren't embroiled in kindergarten conflicts.\n\n(As an aside, I was called a foreign shill by a user here because one of my past submissions on an unrelated subreddit was written in spanish...)\n\nA full coverage of the history of all the drama would take forever, and I'm not even fully up to date on it myself. I try to stick to technological discussion, which gets hard on this subreddit when noone has even read Satoshi's whitepaper (it's like 4 pages and super understandable, take a look if you haven't). Here's one example of the lead *** here discussing their ********** policy: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/\n\n^ actually pretty crazy to read cause they*** correctly forecasted what his actions would end up causing",

It tends not to drop as hard/much as other coins, either. Relatively stable\n\nLTC is another good one but they just saw a *huge* pump so they may not see any decent returns for a while",

Off the top of my head, an example would be Bitfinex announcing NEO-USD trading on the same day they allowed the trading of NEO on their platform in Q3 this year.\n\nBased on that analysis, there is nothing exceptional or unorthodox about Coinbase's release of BCH trading yesterday. In fact, the way that they announced BCH trading was entirely consistent with how they have announced the trading of Litecoin previously: only announcing on the same day/time that the coin was made available for trading. \n\nI can only imagine there are a lot of angry people here singling out Coinbase to take the rap for BTC's unfortunate price correction yesterday. But then again, that price correction happened as a result of market forces: Coinbase had nothing to do with it. ",

What I don't understand, is this insistance on finding a scaling solution that can do Visa level tx/sec and only accepting it if it could do that or rejecting and objecting it entirely.  Bitcoin or any other crypto doesn't need to replace Visa and it doesn't need to have Visa-like transaction capacity. There is some middle ground. But 4 per second doesn't cut it.",

All of this is new money to the economy and it is going to drop very, very fast. I'm thinking below $1,000 before the buyers make it in to supports. Savvy buyers who value BCH will wait as long as they can before buying, they will be perfectly fine with it dropping to $500 before triggering support.\n\nHow much and how fast it recovers from the release of this money remains to be seen, but because of the large amount of money being *created* into the economy today, you will need a pump to get back to the current price.",

Sure, a commodity with a fixed supply will always go up in value as long as there sufficient/constant demand. However, if the demand drops to 0, the price will fall to 0 and it will be worthless. If the only source for demand of Bitcoin is the fact that it goes up in price, what happens when it doesn't go up in price? What happens if it goes down? It won't have any more use and will become worthless. The only reason Bitcoin was even worth anything in the first place because it was a medium of exchange and a global decentralized digital cash. That is actually super cool and useful! I love that. However, Bitcoin Core and co don't love that. Now Bitcoin Cash is attempting to actually fulfill that use case as a global P2P currency. I wonder if Bitcoin Core fumbled the ball so bad that it will prevent BCH from taking over even though y'all started with 100% market share and 1st mover advantage. It's pretty amazing that the core developers screwed up so badly. Now, it will probably be ETH or some other coin that has better fundamentals that allow real use cases that will drive real demand in the real world. Store of Value? Ha!",

For the most part I can agree there could be a balance (probably most likely when there is no change in price) but the people \"cashing out\" most likely there bitcoin goes to an exchange wallet. And then when someone buys, then the exchange take bitcoin out  of their wallet & sell you you... is it seriously not like that? Because if not, for some reason if i Wanted to buy a weird number of bitcoin , lets say $12,345.78 & someone right then and there wasn't trying to sell that amount then i wouldn't be able to buy it?",

The interesting part is that this is a better example of how new money effects things than a hard fork because now we have two existing currencies with viable markets (at least in this example) and one of them is getting a massive increase in its circulating supply while the other is not. I think this makes it more interesting to watch than a hard fork as a hard fork you get two currencies but only 1 has a viable market at the time.",

I prefer litecoin to Bcash because it's average confirmation time is actually much lower for the same number of transactions (faster block times.)  So if litecoin is already successfully filing the gap of a coin that can do around 50 tx/sec, I think it is fair for Bitcoin to aim bigger as the coin that will do thousands of transactions per second with low fees. \n\nI think most Bitcoin supporters are looking beyond 6 months.  If bitcoin can do thousands of transactions per second in a few years, why will we need a coin that can do 40 or 50?  If Lightning Network does work be prepared for Litecoin and Bcash both to be worth near zero (which is a bit scary for me because I have lots of Litecoin!)",

            "Text": "Yes you do have to give the exchange your bitcoin/money before doing trades, but the exchange never actually buys bitcoin itself. You can either place a buy or sell order at a certain amount and certain price. The order won't actually go through until there is someone else who agrees to that price. If you put up a whole bitcoin you might only sell a portion of it if there's no one that wants to buy the entire bitcoin. Or it could go the other way if you want to buy a whole bitcoin but there's only 1/4 of one up for sale at your set price, so you would only get that.\n\nIf you take a look at an exchange like [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD) you can see a list of all the buy and sell orders currently set. And you can see how they come and go.",

As you buy BTC, USD is taken from your account and given to those you buy from.  \n  \nIf you buy 1 BTC, it might be from one seller or 100 sellers selling 0.01 BTC each.  \nSame with selling BTC, if you put 1 BTC on the market, parts of it might go to different buyers.  \nEither way, it's just a number in the exchanges system that represent their customers actual holdings.",

It's faster than a wire typically (especially international and people joke that hopping on a plane with a check is faster than those wires) and I think it has other tech values that make it an important future for currency. I'm a believer in crypto and Bitcoin, that's why I use it for more than just a store of value. As second and third layer scaling solutions become implemented, Bitcoin will be a very strong contender for currency though right now Bitcoin *is* experiencing growing pains but I can imagine by the end of 2018 we will not be talking about high transaction times.

There is also a [bech32 pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11167) that has already been merged into master.",
