They need to tell everyone what they are working on and why it\u2019s important. Bitcoin stayed at 1mb block. They are in the know and need to speak. \n\nOther cryptocurrencies have people explaining everything and why certain tech has to be implemented sooner rather than later. Why can\u2019t these core developers be more outspoken?! They have to be frustrated that Segwit is under 45% after a year.\n\nPublic speaking may not be their area of expertise but they if they want the technical advancements they developed to be used, Tell people how important it is or it\u2019s going to sit on the shelf for 2 more years. How frustrating must it be for them to work on projects and have them not be used. ",

            "Text": "I think a lot of people's disappointment in Bitcoin stems from the assumption that it was guaranteed it would go up. If it was always generally going up, then surely it will always go up. If it hit $20K then surely it will hit $20K again. It's not necessarily gonna work like that. Even if it succeeds in its adoption.\n\nIn the world of investment, nothing is guaranteed. The second you think you have something figured out, is the second it will do the exact opposite of what you were expecting.\n\nBitcoin itself is not a guaranteed thing yet. There's no mass adoption yet, and the general public is still very cautious and a bit fearful of it, and they've now had a decade to jump on board. Plus if they eventually embrace cryptocurrency, who's to say they won't embrace another crypto? They might seek something faster and cheaper, or a better alternative might pop up along the way in the next year. Nobody knows for sure. I personally love Bitcoin and the tech, but who's to say everyone else will see things the same way I do.\n\nEven if Bitcoin gets adopted, it's not guaranteed the price is gonna \"moon\". It's a possibility, but there's a lot of other possible scenarios. Remember how the introduction of futures contracts created this counter-force to the price of Bitcoin. With mass adoption, you may also see an increase of counter forces, maybe some put in place on purpose to keep Bitcoin more stable and more useful so the price doesn't fluctuate. Since mass adoption is more likely to work with a more stable price, in order for Bitcoin to succeed, it may have to stop shooting up and fluctuate wildly, and not \"moon\". \n\nJust keep your mind open to other possible scenarios, so you don't get surprised, and most of all don't get burned when it doesn't go your way. This is by no means meant to be bearish talk. I'm still a believer in Bitcoin. You can be hopeful and bullish, and still keep an open mind about bearish possibilities. ",

Revolut was such a hassle free app for exchanging currencies. But I just recently find out that my bank has also introduced competitive exchange rate without commissions, don't know when they did it but they definitely aim these changes at Revolut. So Revolut immediately lost its charm when banks start maneuver and being competitive again. Maybe the same thing will happen to Bitcoin, it is still difficult to use and too complex to store for average consumers. Browsing post here feels like reading news a propagenda machine. I guess we will have a long long time before anything get interesting again. ",

Although technically true it's not just like another company's stock or something, it's closer to people coming to terms with the importance of the invention of cars, computers, assembly lines, or the printing press.\n\n Plus, \"normal\" government finance has dug itself so deep from its perceived monopoly that the majority of potential is not from a \"spaceship\" but from \"a boat that is just not leaking at an ever increasing rate.\" Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the balance but I just wanted to add some re-balancing remarks.",

Same thing on the Telegram. 8 months ago ons person got pissed cause i said 2018 will be a bearmarket and he asked for a ban. These people aren't investors, they are crazy. As an investor, the words negative and positive or the word fud does not exist. 90 percent of crypto investors are completely insane/obsessive. It's like a cult, they are no real investors but more fanatic than Isis in their own religion.",

Once you get a relatively stable period, people will begin to believe that it's a good time to buy again (we're probably in this period right now).

Despite the recent gigantic FUD by mainstream medias about BTC using too much energy etc.  \nI'm probably biased but I think it would need a catastrophic news/event to pull it way under the current price.

Do you have an appreciation of how much energy it takes to move a dollar on BTC vs VISA or SWIFT? Bitcoin is NOT an efficient payment network. It has other cool properties, but efficiency is not one of them.\n\n>it can cut off labour costs for companies by putting parts of their process on blockchain\n\nUm what, that sounds like adding labour costs to me? Again, blockchain has some cool properties like trustlessness, but efficiency is not one of them.\n\n>it can cut off additional banking costs for companies\n\nWhat are you talking about? Companies need to do three things, buy stuff, sell stuff, and pay their employees. This all happens in fiat. What savings are you talking about?\n\n>it can cut off labour costs for banks,\n\nMaybe. Interbank settlement (eg ripple) is actually a really cool application of DLT. Keep in mind SWIFT v3 achieves the same thing with a fraction of the energy usage.\n\n>it can stimulate entrepreneurship everywhere, especially in third world countries\n\nSure.\n\n>it can bank the unbanked\n\nIt's about a decade too late. M-Pesa's pretty darn efficient and has a massive market share. Hard to see how Blockchain is going to make it more efficient.\n\n>it can lead to flow of money directly to the one who needs it, surpassing corrupt governments\n\nSubverting government is not really an efficiency thing.\n\n>it can cut off government costs\n\nExample please?\n\nThere's a single example in there that really makes sense (interbank transfers). Everything else is just propaganda.",

            "Text": "I don't think you've read enough whitepapers of cryptocurrencies to understand how precisely blockchain is going to revolutionize things, with all due respect. \n\n \n\n*Well not yet. If you want to do anything with your BTC you probably need to convert it to fiat via an exchange. That's less efficient. Do you have an appreciation of how much energy it takes to move a dollar on BTC vs VISA or SWIFT? Bitcoin is NOT an efficient payment network. It has other cool properties, but efficiency is not one of them.*\n\n \n\nI'm not only talking about btc. I'm talking about blockchain. Imagine being able to sell and buy your energy as a household yourself like with power ledger, instead of passing through big energy companies. And there are many more examples like these in different domains. it will cut off many middle men and could even cause redistribution of wealth towards the middle class in the long term, something the current economic system clearly cannot achieve (the current system is extremely unequal, with wealth accumulated at the top and everyone else staying poor or stagnate). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Um what, that sounds like adding labour costs to me? Again, blockchain has some cool properties like trustlessness, but efficiency is not one of them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuite the contrary. When companies work together when it comes to production lines for example, instead of each having their own centralized system, it will cut off costs and labour costs. Other examples are financial decentralization (instead of different centralized isolated systems within each different company) and IT decentralization et cetera. It will reduce costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n*What are you talking about? Companies need to do three things, buy stuff, sell stuff, and pay their employees. This all happens in fiat. What savings are you talking about?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a company. I pay fees to use payment systems. Banking fees. Some crypto have zero or almost zero fees. If you're a big company, just making your clients pay in for your service in crypto will cut off paying these fees. And when you sell alot, you cut off alot of fees.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n*It's about a decade too late. M-Pesa's pretty darn efficient and has a massive market share. Hard to see how Blockchain is going to make it more efficient.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDidn't know Mpesa. Haven't done enough research about it to be honest. maybe you're right, don't know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n *Example please?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost all government systems are centralized systems and because of this centralized system they constantly need to be monitored and controlled et cetera. Decentralizing systems on blockchain based on the blockchain trustless system will reduce their costs. Centralized systems are also prone to mistakes and corruption, adding indirect costs. One example is being able to vote through a blockchain system, from your own house, watching tv. There are current systems and countries where you can vote digitally, but these systems are prone to hackers and corruption, etc. A blockchain voting system is more reliable. The vote is registred on the blockchain and nobody can change it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*There's a single example in there that really makes sense (interbank transfers). Everything else is just propaganda.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, if you read my post you'll see i'm extremely critical. I don't like to make propaganda for btc nor crypto. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just don't think you understand the full possibilities of blockchain. You're only looking at the disadvantages instead of the possibilities. There is alot of progress still to be maid, and new problems will arise, but in the end, I think it's revolutionary. I can go into more detail with alot of whitepaper plans from cryptocompanies, but i advise you to read them yourself if you didn't do it. Some ideas are really well thought and satisfy needs. Meanwhile, stay critical of course, that's a good thing. ",

If you're a big company, just making your clients pay in for your service in crypto will cut off paying these fees. And when you sell alot, you cut off alot of fees.\n\nLet me get this straight. You, as a business owner, would go to your clients and tell them that you're no longer taking their legal tender. Instead you will tell them that they must convert their money to crypto (incurring \\*massive\\* risk of price swings, on unregulated exchanges, submitting a tonne of personal information for KYC compliance) so that you, as the SUPPLIER, can save less than 1% on transaction fees?\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\nThe other examples you've given are just spraying blockchain around like it's some magical sauce. You're not actually identifying any problems and explaining how DLT solves that problem.\n\nGovernment inefficiency? Blockchain.\n\nSupply chain centralisation? Blockchain.\n\nPaying utilities? Blockchain.\n\nThere's actually a simple test to validate whether your examples are substantive or meaningless hyperbole. Replace \"bitcoin\" with any other tech buzzword over the last 20 years, eg \"artificial intelligence\" and see if the sentence still makes sense.\n\n**Artificial intelligence**: It can cut off middle men, it can cut off labour costs for companies, it can cut off additional banking costs for companies, it can cut off labour costs for banks, it can stimulate entrepreneurship everywhere, especially in third world countries, it can bank the unbanked, it can lead to flow of money directly to the one who needs it, surpassing corrupt governments, it can cut off government costs, et cetera et cetera. The advantages are numerous and extreme.\n\nYep ... checks out.\n\nBlockchain solves a very specific problem. It's not magic. There will be some really cool things that get built on Blockchain, but most of the problems you've listed could also be solved (and more efficiently) with a good old fashioned centralised database.",

Period.  \n\nAnd that has been the massive strategic mistake made by Ver and his cadre.\n\nI could create a coin today with a limit of 21 million.\n\nAll of these digital assets are just numbers.  Intangible electrons bumping around the world's networks!\n\nSo why - just why - would you put your valuable assets into an imitator?  And a discredited one at that.\n\nBcash is surrounded by controversy and characters like Faketoshi, convicted criminal Ver, dodgy character Ayres.\n\nIt would be stupid.\n\nTheir floor certainly is zero.\n\n\n\n",
