He wanted me to join ,using his affiliate off course. I did my own research and realized it was probably a pyramid scheme and turned him down. While researching it I also learned more about Bitcoin. I calculated that he would have earned more if he had just kept his Bitcoin instead of \"investing\". I bought a bunch of Bitcoin instead.\n\nI felt pretty smart about my decision a few days ago.\n\n",

The money that poured into it did so, not because of the technology, but because the price was going up, up, up. That's it. That kind of growth is sustainable for so long. There's only so much extra money people can part with. The viral buzz is gone and soon bitcoin will be forgotten about by all those people. We've already seen the correction, but now, no one knows what will happen next. Exponential growth is no longer a possibility. Not in the near term. So HODL or whatever, or move on to something growing faster if your goal is to make money. If you're in it for the tech, then you needn't be discussing price. ",

(by the way, the mining difficulty adjustments happen about once every two weeks.)\n\non top of that, every four years, that mining reward gets cut in half.\n\nonce all the bitcoins have been mined, miners will still mine for blocks. but at that point, they will make all of their money off of transaction fees, instead of block rewards.",

It's awesome. Surveys show that millenials are eager to adopt Bitcoin as a value store like gold. When those Robinhood clients invest thousand, after thousand, after thousand into BTC and ETH, then we'll see a nice climb.",

If it takes 10 minutes of block and is that the only amount that gives out 12.5?\n\nEach newly created blocks award the lucky miner 12.5 btc + fees.\n\n> So basically some guy in Japan created an ingenious, very sophisticated system that makes people solve complicated math problems in order to be rewarded a code that represents an abstract thing called a Bitcoin and we decided and agreed to give it worth/value based on its Rarity and use as money?\n\nPretty much. Except the creator probably isn't Japanese, nobody knows really. Also proof-of-work isn't very complicated (depending), its essentially solving the problem of sha256\\^2(block-header) < target, see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work\n\n> So the system starts documenting the code from inception everywhere it goes so it's always accountable for and the blockchain system makes this visible to everyone at all times only showing the amount to everyone else not the code which only you know? And every time you spend or send that Bitcoin to somebody else you give them your code which represents it in the system and the system either creates a new code to represent that amount of Bitcoin or adds on to the code once the other person receives it. So you no longer know it and can't access the Bitcoin anymore.\n\nYes so the blockchain contains all transactions that ever happened. Transactions work with digital signatures, so every coin can only be spent if a valid digital signature is produced which only someone who knows the private key of that coin can create. Every fully-verifying wallet checks that every digital signature and other rules are valid, otherwise it won't accept the bitcoin transaction as genuine. So in other words every fully-verifying wallet checks all the rules, and one of those rules is that only miners can create coins out of nothing and only following a [strict schedule.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply)\n",

            "Text": ">So you're saying minors make 12.5 BTC in 10 minutes? Isn't just one BTC like $12000 right now?\n\nRight.\n\nThe miners take a bunch of Bitcoin transactions, bundle them up into a list, attach one to the front of the list that says \"pay 12.5 BTC to my mining address, which didn't exist before this block\", and then toss in a random number (the \"nonce\") and hash the entire thing with the SHA-256 algorithm, twice. If the end result starts with enough 0s (which you can't tell whether it will or it won't without actually trying it) then the block is \"valid\" and they show it to all other miners, who accept it and start trying to build on top of it. If it doesn't start with enough 0s, they add one to the nonce value, and try again. They do this trillions of times per second, basically just guess-and-checking over and over and over. If they get lucky, they get to keep that 12.5 BTC from that one transaction that pays themselves (out of thin air), which is called \"the coinbase transaction\" and it's the only type of transaction that allows bitcoins to be created from nothing. If they tried to make more than 12.5 BTC (or whatever the current \"coinbase\" value happens to be, since it divides in half every four years) then the whole block is invalid and the rest of the network ignores it completely.\n\n>is a bitcoin it self a code or file that actually gets sent between computers and wallets \n\nNo, not really. A bitcoin is an abstract concept. There's no \"file\" that gets sent like what you're imagining. Instead, every single bitcoin comes from a coinbase transaction (meaning that at some point, a miner created it out of thin air via the process described above), and whoever has control of the *private key* which can issue a valid *signature* for the *address* that the coinbase transaction went to, is allowed to \"send\" those coins to any other address with such a signature. There is no \"file\" that moves, but the *available balance* from the first (sending) address gets subtracted from, while the balance of the second (receiving) address gets added to. From then on, the receiver can \"send\" the coins using the same technique (authorizing the send to a new address with a valid signature from their own).\n\nIt's a big ledger (database) of balances, which everyone running a \"Bitcoin node\" is keeping track of. Whenever a new block is added to the chain (by a lucky miner producing it), every node updates its ledger/database to make sure the balances are changed accordingly.\n\nSo the \"coins\" don't actually get \"sent\" like files do when you attach them to an email. Instead, addresses have their balances subtracted from or added to, and we conceptualize or visualize it as \"coins being sent\" because that is easier to understand and imagine.",
