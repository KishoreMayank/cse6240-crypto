Perhaps, you could explain the concept of Layer 2 scaling because I honestly have no idea what it is. I could probably research it and bore myself with incredibly technical description of something I know nothing about. How does more exchanges translate to greater adoption? That\u2019s a terrible argument. That\u2019s like suggesting that a music artist who releases the most album is the best.  You could also say there are over 2000 crypto currencies today so surely mass adoption is increasing. No, that has nothing to do with mass adoption and frankly, I don\u2019t think any of the technical aspects you stated have anything to do with mass adoption.",

With L2 scaling I mean layer 2 scaling and without knowing you are using it right now on the TCPIP protocol when being on the internet: When you browse to a website, you don't tell the entire world wide web you want to retrieve the contents of [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) but you are exactly asking reddit's servers for the content.\n\nBitcoin is the first coin out there with this amazing piece of technology. It offloads massive load on the blockchain (L1) and keeps tx's on a layer above until one end of the channel settles. It not only makes tx's cheaper but also instant (as you don't need to wait for a new block to be found).\n\nSee it as a 'hot' wallet, a wallet that acts lightning fast. Keep a small amount of BTC in there, everything else in cold storage (which I personally don't call a wallet, but a VAULT).\n\nThe amount of development on the protocol and the infrastructure is amazing, no other coin is being backed by this amount of brainpower.\n\nDisruptive technology moves slowly, we don't see disruptive tech often, just every once a generation.\n\n&#x200B;",
