Because last time I checked a bull market was any move over 20% and 3150x1.2=3780, are we above that number-yes. Are we in a bull market? YES\ud83d\ude80\u201d\n\nAnyone want to disagree with that statement? You can say Bitcoin is not like other assets in that respect but my book of technical analysis that I\u2019ve used to risk management says otherwise. We are in a bull market until proven otherwise, the trend is your friend.",

Can you imagine buying groceries and it costs .0031345 for an apple and you have to think about and pay that amount? That's not taking into account the fluctuation of pricing so what is .0031345 BTC today could be .0043567 BTC tomorrow or vice versa. How will you be able to visualize or understand pricing with a currency that is in decimals and constantly fluctuating? The U.S. dollar fluctuates but it is behind the scenes. The unit of account is still $1 dollar. Your diminishing dollar isn't noticed as much because it is less transparent and subtle as compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be used and leveraged in unique cases such as cross border payments where there is already an exchange of currencies and mechanism in place such as currency conversion or foreign exchange so it is business as usual. I don't think it will ever be used for widespread adoption.",

            "Text": "I like the prospect of a decentralized currency that is immune to manipulation and the decisions of major economies. I'm just curious as to how it will play out. I'm specifically focusing on the aspect of goods being valued in Bitcoin as a standalone currency and not in conjunction with the U.S. dollar or whatever fiat currency. \n\nI suppose eventually you will know that a cheeseburger is worth .xx bitcoin much like you know it's worth $2. I guess people are smart enough to gauge the price of goods in other currencies. I'm from the U.S. so all we use is the US dollar. Perhaps elsewhere people are familiar with the general price of goods in their area with their fiat dollar and if need be they can convert to the U.S. dollar interchangeably. I guess I'm just curious as to when or if things being priced in Bitcoin becomes the main unit of monetary value in people's minds. ",

Some idiots attempt to implement \"return to sender\" by sending to a randomly-selected address in an input of the Bitcoin transaction they are returning.  This does not work because exchanges assign addresses to specific people, but when you withdraw from an exchange it just sends from whatever address it happens to have readily available on hand (which more likely than not is an address it assigned to somebody else).  So when the idiot you sent to tried to \"return to sender\" then what really happened is they sent it to a random Bittrex customer, who is very unlikely to be you.  Bittrex cannot return it to you because the lucky customer may very well have withdrawn that amount.\n\nNext time, don't use the idiot you were trying to send money to.  *THERE IS NO RETURN ADDRESS IN BITCOIN*.",

IF youre running a full node, it has all the UTXOs in a database, with a record of which ones changed each block and references that to see if your keys are unspent.\n\nIF youre using a mobile/desktop wallet that doesnt hold the ledger, the wallet is referencing some other copy of the blockchain.\n\nDont think of it as data written to a HDD as we are used to. It doesnt need to be sequential. It seems youre really interested in the detailed \"how\" BTC works. I suggest you subscribe to the dev mailing list and start reading further.

Multiple UTXOs that total 1.0 BTC will require more fees to spend than a single UTXO of value 1.0 BTC.  This is because the transaction needs to list down all the UTXOs you are spending, and having to list down more UTXOs means having a larger transaction means more fees, because fees are about trnsaction size in bytes (really vsize in transaction weight but the details are more complex so ---), not about value.",

It would be much easier if they were priced in BTC. BTC is the currency of the internet. When the rest of the world catches on its going to make online international commerce easier and cheaper.\n\nI fully expect things purchased online within the next decade to be priced in BTC with the USD/JPY/Euro prices fluctuating against it.",
