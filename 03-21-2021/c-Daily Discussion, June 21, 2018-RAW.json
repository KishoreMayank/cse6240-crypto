See thing I don\u2019t get it if the price goes up and the manipulators or whales sell and price goes back down then how is it ever going to increase when no matter what happens they sell and the price gets suppressed right back down. I have no idea how it can ever double in price again if that happens every single time. They just won\u2019t let bit coin get back to that 10 $15,000 range somebody please explain to me how that will even be possible with how they treat the market now any little bit of steam they sell and bring everything right back down",

            "Text": "The problem either applying Zeno's paradox is that it doesn't apply to supply and demand.  If you have a pie worth exactly 1 cut into 8 pieces, each piece is assigned a value of 1/8.  If there are 9 people who want  a slice of pie and each has a finite amount of resources to pay, let's say 1/4 pie, and the pie is being auctioned off to make it as fair as possible, inevitably at least one person will pay more than 1/8 pie for their 1/8 pie while on person gets no pie.  This represents the supply/demand curve.\n\nEssentially the value of 1/8 pie goes up when person loses out on pie because of finite supply. One participant will decide the pie does not hold a specific value that the other 8 would pay.  That is the new price equilibrium.\n\nIf you cut each 1/8 into two slices, you have 16 slices worth 1/16 of a pie until there is more demand than supply, shifting the price equilibrium.  As long as demand and supply don't meet, prices fluctuate.",

Putting aside those that accumulated early and are cashing out whenever they can there are also those that bought late and are eagerly waiting for the price to bump higher to break even and escape the loss. If you need swathes of people to buy  the bags of early whales, miners and retail investors...maybe the bubble has popped and nobody will buy at such high price anymore? Ask yourself, would you buy now for 15k? No? Well, if everyone else is also afraid to buy overpriced asset and there are tons of people who camp on every price point up to 20 thousand waiting for any action to escape this is quite a problem.",
