            "Text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI trade Bitcoin at a professional trading house and these are my thoughts on the future direction of the Value of Bitcoin.\n\nThis is my second ever post so I'm a bit unsure if this is the correct area to post, please advise if I should be posting elsewhere!\n\nI've been live trading this bad boy for a job since the price reached 3k way back when, and these are some of my observations. \n\n1. Although the volume is decreasing by the looks of it on coinmarketcap.com if you look at the biggest exchange that does over 4 Billion a day in size (Bitmex) there has been an increasing amount of volume done over time. (much more volume than the December highs).\n\n2. There was a lot of momentum going from 6k to 20k with all the average people wanting to get on the train and now are left selling off what is left. Conversely there was a lot of Momentum going on the downside of the market when it went from 20k to 5.9k last month. Ever since then there has been more volume (On exchanges, where all the professional traders trade bitcoin) but less momentum as Bitcoin is still deciding which way it wants to go (to $0 or to the moon).\n\nFrom my points noted above and other information I have learned about the Bitcoin market over the year I have 2 scenarios that are likely to happen. \n\n1. over the coming week it will slowly trickle down (consolidate for a few hours then spike down 200 points etc) until it hits $5900 USD where the support was set on February the 2nd (This most certainly will happen as we broke the supports set at $7300 recently.). My thought is that after it trickles down to that support level it will test the level, and if it holds and is able to climb above $7500 that is a significant enough double bottom to be relatively stable. We would most likely then see a consolidation period between $5900 and the double top at $11700. \n\n2. If bitcoin were to break below the $5900 support we are looking at another bloodbath for cryptos. The price would then be in free fall and within 2 weeks I could see it drop to below 3k and then we are set for a wild ride.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, however, I'm not sure of how useful Bitcoin as a currency will be to the world but I have heavy beliefe in the Blockchain technology. \n\nGiven the Volume that is now being traded on exchanges and people the regular folks that have been burnt are starting to leave, I think it is very possible that major investors/players in the market are using this as an opportunity to increase their position in Bitcoin (Especially if it breaks below 5.9k). There will most certainly be another massive bull run, and the regular people will get excited and buy-in on Bitcoin again, will run the price above 20k and we will see another massive sell off. The big investors being the biggest winners as we see the regular folks be burnt once again.\n\nIn no means will I be correct with my predictions but I've been as infront of a screen watching every single move this beast has made over a 6 month period and have profited over 20 Bitcoin over my time. These are just my predictions going into the future. I will most certainly continue to trade this beatiful thing!!\n\nPeace out!\nOla",

But everyone seems to be doing this so the \"bottom\" can be very very low imo. It's a vicious circle. And when it's that low point people will be like \"wtf? I'm not buying this anymore. It's worth nothing now and won't recover\".... Same story goes for all TA \"specialists\". They keep telling everyone \"$XXXX is the bottom, ladder your buys there!\" .. And when $XXXX is near they say \"nah, ladder your buys at $YYYY\"..

You will lose your money if you sell.  It will go back up (someday).\n\nOrdinarily, I would sell when I saw the inevitable down trend.  I would take a 5-10% hit in the estimation I would save purchasing power for still lower prices.\n\nThis last time around I made a cardinal error.  And now, I am paying dearly with massive losses in opportunity and time.\n\nI am down almost 30% on one major crypto-currency.  Now my inaction leaves me with a much more difficult decision.  Cut losses now - at prices not seen since last November and eat a couple grand in losses - or risk seeing even lower prices, prices not seen since last August.\n\nPlease learn from my errors.  If you are going to do this game of rampant speculation and insider information - you have to follow your gut, you have to ignore most of reddit, and you have act decisively.  Fail to do any of these three, and you really risk being in my position.\n\nSo.  Do I \"lock in\" my losses?  Do I wait out the next drop?  Do I hope for a really substantial market drop and then double down to dollar cost average my way out of this?  Honestly, I am really thinking of doing the latter... assuming this place really plummets.\n\nIn any event, I do appreciate those of you who post... and even though I have not posted for a while... I am heartened to see many of the same familiar faces...",

            "Text": "History has shown that once an asset class bubble bursts, it never recovers to become a bubble again \u2014there are rarely any \"second chances\", if any at all.\n\nParadoxically, a volatile and rapid appreciation of a currency, is a failed currency. By definition, currencies are supposed to be recognized, accepted and stable mediums of exchange for goods and services \u2014not just another speculative boom-bust asset class driven by speculative mania like art.\n\nCryptocurrencies can only be considered for adoption once corporations, governments and charities deem the asset class as stable. However, speculators and traders desire anything but stability and thrive on the volatility of 10% intraday price swings \u2014the demographic here are experienced pre-millennial traders from other asset classes, whom quite frankly are careless in regards to the future of cryptocurrencies. So, the demographic 'invested' in cryptocurrencies are the millennials whom have a pseudo-understanding of cryptography and blockchain given their affinity to technology; but with a lack of trading experience and anti-establishment views, they simply adopt a unidirectional mentality, i.e. 'hodl', in the vein that prices will perpetually rocket to the moon.\n\nIts a classic case of where the millennials know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. Real-world intrinsic value will be set by the 'whale' pre-millennials.\n\nSo who actually has any altruistic concern about the future of cryptocurrencies? Nobody. Hence, the bubble bursts. The ALT/BTC tokens are the epitome of manipulation and fraud.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a speculative side implementation of legitimate blockchain technology. Use of blockchain such as distributed ledgers for say the Asset Servicing areas of investment banking are genuine solutions. Once legitimate uses of blockchain are adopted as real-world applications, its then likely a second generation of cryptocurrencies may emerge as stable alternatives to fiat with greater adoption.\n\nQuite possible that the likes of Google, Microsoft and Amazon lead the way with the next generation cryptocurrencies by acquiring the current players. In comparison to a mobile farm in rural China, cloud mining with say Microsoft's Azure decentralised platform with their vast, secure and robust datacentres is most technically feasible and trustworthy.\n\n\u2014If the costs of mining begin to outweigh, then Bitcoin could cease to exist along with the current generation of other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u2014Not all speculative asset classes have survived their respective bubble bursts, especially non-tangible ones.\n\n\u2014Technology, algorithms, software & hardware are short-cycle lifespan industries, subjected to rapid price depreciation and obsolescence. \n\n\u2014If Bitcoin does survive, price volatility would have to subside for adoption, and it must begin to behave like a stable currency as opposed to boom-bust cycles akin to a speculative asset class. Therefore, its success as a currency and survival would be paradoxically tied to no further parabolic price appreciation curves. \n\n\u2014Cicso, the darling of dotcom stocks, the backbone of the Internet, has yet to recover from its parabolic price collapse 20 years on; chart: https://i.imgur.com/zA1L0pz.png\n\nSince inception, the price of Bitcoin and mining complexity have been been parabolically twined. \nHowever, since late Dec 2017, price has more than halved whilst the difficulty of mining remains increasingly complex.\nIs this divergence between price/complexity sustainable economics, whether altruistic in pursuit or incentivised?\nIn other words, would you work harder and for longer whilst your salary decreased? Ask the Virginia coal miners.\n\nPrice: https://i.imgur.com/dkb0Reh.png\n \nDifficulty: https://i.imgur.com/52I6yOz.png\n\nHistorically, when any asset bubble bursts, the unravelling bear market typically lasts 2 years on average (from peak price to ultimate low); and usually erases approx 90% in value (thebubblebubble.com/historic-crashes).\n\nApplying the metrics to the cryptocurrency bubble, it would suggest Bitcoin between $850 and $2500 around 2Q2019.\n\n____\n**^Roadmap: ^https://i.imgur.com/Fzz5Coy.png**\n\n**^Bear ^Market ^Resumes: ^https://redd.it/7z8u6n**\n\n**^#10kNeverAgain: ^https://redd.it/842ssd**\n\n",

            "Text": "Blame the futures markets.  We all thought the start of futures trading would be good for bitcoin bringing in institutional and retail investors.  But we were wrong, and almost immediately negative futures began to bring down actual bitcoin prices.  It doesn't matter that bitcoin futures are settled in dollars and not bitcoin.  Futures move markets.  And big institutional money, like banks, hate bitcoin, think its overvalued, and throw futures money at it to intentionally bring it down.  We also know they hoard enough actual bitcoin to sell and push the exchange bitcoin markets lower timed with the closing dates of futures contracts.  Its been working.  And its kind of an attack.  Who are these futures investors?  Not our usual family of crypto hodlers and traders.  Its not bitcoin whales or Core or the millions of little guys out there buying fractional amounts of bitcoin.  Its not Africans trying to gain stable currency or Venezuelans trying to carry money to food and medicine markets across borders.  Its not college kids.  Its big, bank and institutional players, hedge funds and guys looking to make money bursting the \"bubble\".  They're driving the price down intentionally.  Not to buy huge positions.  They only buy what they need to crash the exchange markets strategically.  Their long term plan is to bust the crypto market. ",

But I blame a lot of these problems on Ver's lying Bcash project and the doubt and confusion it has caused.\n\nBCash is now perilously close to the psychological barrier of being worth less than 0.10000000 BTC.\n\nWhen that happens, the ASIC miners will panic and sell their Bcash holdings, Bcash's price will collapse and trust me - we will again see erect green dildo's all over the charts - led by BTC.",

Lie to merchants and mislead them into believing that unconfirmed transactions are actually confirmed. https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/87ym3g/the_case_for_renaming_zeroconf_to_simply_verified/\n\nHere is a quote from the article\n>Even if we fixed the non-existent double spending on zero-conf, it still looks untrustworthy to a merchant currently unless they know a lot about Bitcoin. (It's a presentation problem)\n\n>This is just being in the shoes of the merchant. Zero-conf sounds like NOTHING has been verified.\n\n>I know it's cheating a little bit, but I think naming 0-confirmation to simply \"verified\" will go a long way to changing this perception.\n\n>To me as a merchant, if you say \"verified\" but 0/3 confirmations that's good enough for me. I get that it's not 100%, but it's good enough. When you say it's just 0/3 confirmations or zero-conf, it just says to me the transaction is not done at all.",

            "Text": "Any opinions? 'They' are shorting, squeezing out all the profit w/ lower highs, lower lows, to as low as possible to buy the floor, then will let it run up to 100K plus. I see a lot of smarter traders and long time BTC'ers now speculating that HOLDing is a mistake....cause it basically allows 'Them' to fleece what little new money is coming in, and leave the rest of us as bag holders, while accumulating w/ sophisticated PA and bots. I hear the 1-3K number tossed around a lot as a real possible floor. Anyone think this is overstating? I know it makes mining unprofitable, but it doesn't ruin BTC, just seriously consolidates and flushes out more little guys. Can anyone give me a good reason to sell at a loss, transfer everything over to alts, or just long term HOLD for the next year, despite a possible 95% retracement? How much leverage does WS and CBOE shorting have against the Libertarian, Cypherpunks, and general public? Certainly not as much as they would have everyone believe, but dips are definitely coordinated with bad news, and Unnatural huge drops, that look like obvious market manipulation, and trigger all the traders to sell down.",

I predict Bitcoin will of course recover but it will be a very long time, like 2021 for it to get back to 20K. It doesn\u2019t seem like whales are manipulating the price. With whales, the price of Bitcoin takes a nosedive and Bitcoin has been in steady decline all week. This is not whale-like behavior. All the reason I see to sell and not HODL. And who really knows what the F John McAfee is doing with his Bitcoin? He might be selling more than anybody; we live in a twisted world. I think Bitcoin will fall to $6000 and then stay in the $6-10K range until June where it takes a further nose dive down to $4K. Of course, I\u2019ve been wrong many times before and not the best trader. But, I\u2019m making my basis off 2013 trends which would lead you to believe...lots of decline and stagnancy are ahead.",

Makes no sense at all.\n\n2. The bottom of BTC was at USD 6000. Now it is rebounding from 6600. This could well be a higher bottom. Certainly looking at the candle stick that is forming today, the chance you sell at the lowest point is much greater than the chance that BTC drops through the 6000 USD support level.\n\n3. Trying to time the bottom is expensive. The only way to do it is to be on top of your computer all day. Likelyhood is you get out now, you look again a day later, or the next morning, and BTC is back at 9000. This is how fast recoveries tend to go. I do not have the time and energy to be on top of the price 24/7 to avoid buying back more expensive.\n\n4. With regulation on the way, more and more institutional investors are looking at cryptos. For instance the 500M crypto hedgefund of Mark Yusko. But many others big players, including Blackrock are preparing to invest in bitcoin and possibly other cryptos. Once they get in it is going to go crazy. This could start tomorrow, next week, next month or in June or so. I am not risking missing the boom or having to buy back higher.\n\nIn short, if you believe BTC has no future. Sell now. If you think it has, this is a time to buy, not to sell.\nIn January it was a good time to sell. The basics of investing continue to be the same: buy low, sell high. Not the opposite.",

If the answer is yes, keep it invested. If it\u2019s not, disinvest.\n\nA big factor is whether you\u2019re willing to lose it. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset. In a years time it could be worth nothing, it could be worth 10x what it is now. No one knows. If your life would be a lot worse if you lost the $500 disinvest now. If not and you believe in the product, keep it.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: assuming crypto currency catches on to the mainstream, if the mainstream chooses a different currency, Bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin was first, and has the highest market share at the moment, but imagine the impact if amazon, google or Facebook created a crypto currency. Investment in bitcoin is not the same as investment in block chain or investment in the concept of crypto currency.",

It will get to the point where the average person has forgotten about it but no person or thing on this planet can ever kill nerd money. Now that it's out there, it's out. People are hating on it because they invested in it improperly and are getting burned. It will go down much further than this, I agree but remember this. Bitcoin was the first. It has been through much worse than this. The only thing bitcoin did wrong was become too expensive. It is incredibly useful and resilient. I firmly believe as globalization and global trade integrate with IoT and future technology, a cryptocurrency will become essential. Bitcoin is like band-aid. We don't say adhesive strip. We say band-aid. ",

There are many groups who have a lot to lose if bitcoin succeeds.  \n\nThe answer is we fish (and benevolent whales \ud83d\udc33) need to unite and buy and hodl. There are only 21 million coins. The more fish that hodl the more power we have.  The bad guys will lose eventually.   Bitcoin is unstoppable in the long run.  The sooner we get on board the faster this will happen.

Dips don't usually go straight down, there are usually \"bounces\" some larger than others the final \"bounce\" is usually indication of short/long term bottom and/or trend reversal bear to bull.  Incidentally the last time daily RSI was below 30?  Feb 5-6.  Highest daily buy volume in the past year or so?  Feb. 6.\n\nJust my feeble thoughts...\n\n",

            "Text": "I'd say that compared with yesterday, there is an increased volume and resistance. Appear to be a stalemate for now. Yesterday I bet on the price going down due to low volumes and behavior of traders so I sold at 7.8k and bought back at 6.9k, with a couple of stops and bounces in between.\n\nToday the market seem to be in different shape and more hard to read. Directional bets appear to be more risky at the moment, at least that's my impression. Not sure if bears or bulls might see losses today, could go both ways. For mid-April I am bullish based on the charts from 2017 and 2016, so there might be increasing buying pressure in the air.",

If it is clear that more downside is likely then when not simply convert to your local currency and buy back in at a lower price? Currently there has been a slight bounce. I am going to see how far this goes. However, if we see the price touch the point it bounced at again and then breakdown below it, I will sell. There is just no logic in holding in asset that you are well aware is devaluing. By buying back in at a lower price you make a profit. ",

What has been difficult to learn, is that traditional methods for evaluating an investment do not really apply to cryptocurrency.  Gold, real estate, stocks, bonds, all have pretty easily understandable rules.  So my investment/gamble was just that.  My buying or selling or holding will have zero to do with the adoption of ledger technology or the adoption of non-sovereign or corporate based stores of wealth.  So my original reason WAS a speculative play.  And today, it remains a speculative play.  But it is your thought about bubbles which also has my attention.  Bubbles ordinarily don't re-inflate once they burst... at least not for a very long time.",

            "Text": "Big boys like the ones you see in the news taking an optimistic tone now. No way they will buy bitcoins at your sale price, they want you to panic and donate them to their hedge funds. \n\nCheck out the trends where investment banks like Goldman rate stocks as sells and claim they are hot garbage, then pick up all the shares the scared people are dumping. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc are all now in the Bitcoin game. Famous manipulators, they don't even care to hide it. I think it was Jamie dimon of JP who once said something along the lines of go ahead and fine me for market manipulation, I already profited more than the fine will be \n\nSo what they do is load up bitcoins nice and steady, then dump them all in a market sell. When small guys like us see multi millions in bitcoins being sold, taking out all the bids like lightning, we get scared and sell. They liquidate your futures contracts, then close theirs out profit on the downside and use those profits to accumulate more BTC. \n\nThere's going to be an ongoing effort to rebalance the bitcoins into their accounts. You don't get to invest in something before wall st cuts off their own chunk, but you did with Bitcoin. That's pissed them off, they want your coins. ",

            "Text": "My view.. TA works because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If every trader and every bot were to follow the same TA rules you could potentially identify supports and resistances almost always because it's where everyone would place buy and sell orders, respectively. It can't always work because obviously not everyone follows TA and whoever does, does not follow the same rules. But when it works, it's not by sheer chance. And when it does not, you either got it wrong or it's not valid anymore and you have to start from scratch. Plus, whales. When they get in action you might as well throw TA out of the window.",

            "Text": "> You might as well say, \"I have no clue what I am doing.\"\n\nI'm 44 years old and I retired, partially thanks to crypto (generally about 6% of my net worth).  I've made money in real estate and stock markets for 26 years.  Today, I spend 60% of the year on my boat in the Caribbean and by age 45 I hope to spend 80% of the year there.\n\nDollar cost averaging works magic -- in stock markets, in real estate, in crypto, in bonds, in bullion.  The reason for this is every dollar you invest in SOMETHING is a $1 you aren't throwing away on video games or alcohol or some useless chinese toy.  So even if that $1 is worth $0.50 in a year, it's not worth $0 like it would be if you bought another star wars lego toy.\n\nDollar cost averaging smooths the volatility out like crazy.  I don't catch falling knives, I buy assets at the current value and if and when they go up, I'll have more than the guy trying to time the market with daytrading.  Usually a lot more.\n\nFWIW in the past 26 years of investing, none of my day trading friends are retired or close to it.  Not a single one.  But ALL of my friends who dollar cost averaged are either retired or could if they hated their careers.",

Drops are generally more cost-efficient unless there is decent resistance. It's just hard to extract a particular price range from a complex set of factors.\n\nFor the price to drop to a particular point the sellers need to be more eager to sell than the buyers to buy. At lower prices this equation changes, making it hard to predict a potential price range several thousand dollars downwards or upwards.\n\nOn the other hand, the benefit of drops and crashes is that newcomers can enter at a better price point, which increase the market. Newcomers coming in at an ATH will generally have a less positive experience.",

            "Text": "True dip* this isn't it. Why? We were here nearly last week. Btc couldn't fall past 7.3k. So this has been more of a stable $1k up and down in \"dips\" with 8.2/3k as the base. The stable days changed by 300 to $500. The previous dip lows have been in 3k drops. This makes sense as the months high 11.6k. Making 8.2/3k nearly a 3k dip (but far exceeding that at 7.3k: so 1k more in behavior change). With that said. We could guess that this \"true dip\". If it happens will be around 4-5k. As the market on went up by 2k after hitting 7k then back down. Baselining 8k. That's my anticipation. People were saying 3k at a point. But that may never happen.",

            "Text": "I think more downside is likely because we are in a bear market. In a bear market downside is the trend. People have been saying it is quite likely we\u2019ve seen the bottom for months now. \n\nThere is no reason to think the bottom has occurred until there is some kind of real turn around. I agree with you that it\u2019s always a risk. Yes, you could sell now and then the turn around occurs causing you to buy at a higher price. But that\u2019s why I said to wait until something confirms the price is going lower first. \n\nIf the price breaks down below 6k you can be assured that panic selling will occur and it will start dropping like a stone. We\u2019ll just need to wait and see I guess.",

            "Text": "Sorry to say buddy, but you are in fact brainwashed. You've been fed lies since 2004, a chain succession stemming from George Bush to Obama and Hillary Clinton. Its not so ridiculous when the truth is starting to emerge, is it? There is a slow bleed of data that has been coming out since the start of the election. A lot of the ties to Russian intervention are largely overexxagerated propoganda that was put into place by a joint effort of Obama, the Clintons, and the Democratic party. This was all in the beginning stages of trying to solidify a victory for HRC and to remove Bernie Sanders from the picture.\n\nJulian Assange and Snowden have been jointly leaking the information for years now, and as more critical information linked to corruptions within the coverup have become available in Q4 2017 -Q1 2018, things are starting to really make sense now. Its only a matter of time before the domino effect of HRC and her disgusting network are continually exposed. The cover ups have lasted for too long and Julian Assange has been forcibly cut from access in Ecuador with recent leaks. They can't hide forever and they won't. Everyone involved in that disgusting network of attempting to rig the democratic election, cover up pedophilia on a national level, and misuse global rights charity funds are the lowest scum of the Earth imaginable. They've only survived for so long because of their status within the government and protections by parties that are starting to lose traction with the details that continue to emerge.\n\nI bet you will adamantly defend Mark Zuckerberg for his involvement in the election too. Even if you dislike Donald Trump, the fact that he violated privacy laws and used a social media platform for political influence says a lot. \"Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as \"surveillance companies.\" Their rebranding as \"social media\" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.\"",

I don't need to sell per se, and if things do crash down to sub 4K levels, I can still buy up a deal. I do see the market downtrend continuing for the short/mid term. However, things can flip so fast in crypto, and with a day job and no time/care to do all the TA and chart watching, I don't want to miss the bottom and fuk myself. Would you recommend selling now, and sitting $ on the sidelines until a more serious bottom occurs, or try to trade the obvious up/downs on the way the there?",

I took them all off line when I retired in 2015 though, but if someone wants to compare investments, I'm always happy to discuss in private.\n\nhttps://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2010/11/21/saupload_dollar_cost_averaging.png\n\nThe funny thing is with all of the market volatility in many markets in 2018, my portfolio is actually up for the year versus a lot of folks who are down 3-4%.  DCA has done justice for me yet again.",

It's the same thing as tuning a coin into fiat, paying your tax bill, then taking out a loan and buying that much in coins again (ignoring exchange fees). You're still banking on the fact that the coins you have will go up to cover the loan you just took out.",

No you dumbass, when these banks trade something like this they milk it for all they can, and yeah they could easily be making billions off these swings with their type of money. \n\nIn a mostly unregulated market too?

Why would other pairs hit zero, when there is so much private VC $ tied up in ALT's? There are tons of companies all - in. Those guys will keep pushing and NO way they just sell for such a loss.  They will keep pushing their business models, and there will be loads of bag holders that would never sell at a 90% loss. Distribution isn't as skewed as BTC. I hear you on BTC prices though...I feel somewhat naive at this point with my initial enthusiasm, but in honestly looks like there is more resilience to crypto than you predict.

Never give anyone who knows about these things enough ammo to blast your bullshit outta the sky. \n\nSo you followed that rule invested for 26 years and have now retired at 44. Sounds good. So I will assume you have the bare minimum necessary to retire lets say 2 million (Not enough to spend all your time on boat in a caribbean but your living a fantasy so I will too, this would give you 50k a year from now til death to spend) . That means for those 26 years you have to have average annual returns of up to 7% from 1991-2017. \n\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/stock-market-returns-by-year-2388543 The unusal thing is that the biggest gains would have occured when you were just starting 1995,96,97 and the biggest losses when you were near the end 08. Everyone knows how compounding works and that situation above is what we call \"OMG you got fucked in the ass\". But let's assume you somehow managed to time two of the biggest market busts in 2000 and 2008 so you could average 7%, you still would need to invest 2,000 per month during those years. So where did you work at that at 18 that left you with 2000 in disposable income? \n\nDon't tell me real estate rents because even back in before 2005 banks were not stupid enough to give multiple mortgages to people without steady income? and real estate only starts paying off once the note is paid for.

            "Text": "Ah yes, thats why all those mega financial institutions got wiped out. tv brainwashed dimwits they were. \n\nYou know how investing works right? You are aware how compounding works right? \n\nSo a 38% return in 1996 means OP would have had ~106,000 in the account and the return of 38% that year means op ended the year at 146,280. However in 2008 OP would have had 1,396,240 in that account and that year when the market dipped 38% OP would have lost ~530,571. Big gains at the start, with big losses at the end is a recipe for disaster in an investment. \n\nLiving in the Carribbean maybe cheap, but fucking boats capable of being lived on are not. Boats are motherfucking expensive!!! Don't believe me, than just literally ask anyone who has ever owned a boat.  Plus his expenses here would not stop. I'm assuming OP will still have a boat note and a mortgage or property taxes. So that 1500 is in addition to his regular living expenses. \n\nI see you didn't touch the main point of the arguement. That OP need to squirrel away in excess of 2,000 per MONTH to achieve those results for 26 years. Considering OP started investing at 18 I would like to know where he worked that he had 2,000 per month to hide away in investments!      \n\nThat only gets him 2 million. This is barely enough to retire on at 44, not enough to buy a boat and live a millionaire's lifestyle as claimed.  \n\nIts a bullshit story, dont defend it. ",

Maybe they should have known to buy the dip!!! \n\nThis is shitty bitcoin talk, buying the dip works when you dont have skin in the game. Buying the dip doesn't necessarily work once you have skin in the game. \n\nAmazon is a growth stock. You do not invest in growth stocks for long term gains. That is a fools errand, and causes people to lose a ton of money. In fact if you reinvested dividends from a company like Exxon the compounding would put you far in front of Amazon even if you bought it for pennies. This is how most investors get tripped up. They are swinging for fences when the bases are loaded, and all they need to do is hit a safe ground ball to win. \n\n2 million is probably not enough to retire at 44. That only leaves you 50k a year (Hopefully his money is still not 'at risk'). That does not include the cost of cars, boats, trips to the caribbean (he is not retiring there he said he spends his time there). If I was his advisor I would be extremely worried. He risks running out of money during retirement, and medical bills are going to start creeping in. By the time he figures out he doesnt have enough to make it, he will be way to old to fix it.  ",
