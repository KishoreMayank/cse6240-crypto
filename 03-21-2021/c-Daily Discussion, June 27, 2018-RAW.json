When we crashed from $1000 in 2014 it took 3 years to recover (2017 RUN), even in stocks, when amazon crashed 90&#37; it took 3 years, when apple crashed 70&#37; it took 3 years. It takes a long time for investors to gain back confidence. Currently most of the investors can't wait for it to go back to 7k so they can short the price and get some of their loses back then we're back down again. This cycle will repeat until a less anxious, less paranoid group of investors are willing to hold and increase the support lines. I GUARANTEE YOU 3 YEARS BEFORE WE SEE ANYTHING OVER 12K FOR BTC. It doesn't matter if the US Gov announces that they're going to make BTC the official currency of America. Investors have proven to be irrational and almost totally immune to good news. ",

If not, watch this short video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=waTFF_HSZI8&t=24s   \n But what are people on the street doing?  Here's a high level look at that:     \"Despite bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently hovering near their lows for the year, interest in the nascent technology is expected to more than double in the future in the United States and Europe. This is according to a study conducted by ING Bank N.V. in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and Australia.\n\n\"Per the survey, which was carried by market research firm Ipsos between March 26 and April 6, 2018, only 9% of Europeans owned a cryptocurrency at the time of polling. However, in the future 25% of those surveyed indicated that they expect to own a cryptocurrency. In the United States, 8% at the time owned cryptocurrencies while 21% said they expected to own some in the future.\"\n    https://www.2100news.com/2018/06/27/cryptocurrency-ownership-in-europe-and-the-us-expected-to-double-ing-study/\n   All indicators point to a still growing cryptocurrency market.

Since there is utterly no reason for that trend to break, at least in the near future, it means that you're looking at 5000s by August, 4000s by October, 3000s by December, etc. Then, at some point under 3000 the price will likely bottom and then go nowhere fast until there is some material change (what that might be is anybody's guess). It's also possible that at some point folks could start to equate BTC with Iraqi dinars, etc., in which case the bottom could fall out entirely.",

The bitcoin price you will see at the end of 2018 should be settling around at or below mining price which is anywhere from couple 1000s up to 8000 (prices vary among different countries) but more realistically, it should drop towards the 2000s to 3000s range (USD).\n\nI don't see much recovery for the crypto market anytime soon. It will take maybe a decade or longer to reach ATH ($19750+) again.  In the meantime, cryptos have been really shitty lately and I STRONGLY believe that this trend will only continue for months or (more precisely) years to come. BTW...Before I joined Reddit, I've made this same exact prediction as early as February when the whole market started going into flames and every naysayer and their dog was flaming and berating me for stating \"blatant nonsense\". Now look who's got the last laugh! I sure showed them. \n\nIf you are making the decision to sell, then all I can say is that you're not making a bad decision in any sense. You will be very happy you did but also consider what other vehicles of investment are available. (Bonds, stocks, CDs, TIPS....)\n",

            "Text": "> All indicators point to a still growing cryptocurrency market.\n\nExcept actual adoption. Still practically no one actually uses bitcoin for purchasing stuff, everyone is only using it to get rich quick. There are more major companies that are stopping their bitcoin acceptance than ones that start, citing complete lack of use. I had hoped that this would gradually improve over the years but it looks like adoption has hit a complete standstill for years now. And without this, all price movement is just foundationless speculation and has the potential to collapse far harder than it already has.",

It takes a long time for investors to gain back confidence. Currently most of the investors can't wait for it to go back to 7k so they can short the price and get some of their loses back then we're back down again. This cycle will repeat until a less anxious, less paranoid group of investors are willing to hold and increase the support lines. I GUARANTEE YOU 3 YEARS BEFORE WE SEE ANYTHING OVER 12K FOR BTC. ",

            "Text": "Michael, what you feel is never important.  You also \"felt\" you had to HODL back in January 2018.  Good traders never believe that they are right.  They look for signs of what the market is telling them.  There's enough chance for error in just attempting to do that.  It requires lots of experience.  The blow-out December top \n(I believe I counted 7 stacked flags on the graph) with its massive trading volume was a screaming top to anyone who has ever traded stocks.  Regardless of the later stellar growth potential for any such stock, you must step aside at such a moment.  If BTC ever sees the likes of that again, remember your experience and don't get greedy, take some of your winnings off the table, and wait to see what happens.  If you had done so back then (waiting to see a new break-out from the lofty price) you probably would have re-entered the gamble at a much lower buy point.  BTC trades just like a stock. It advances and declines on a mix of fear and greed, and the footprints of trading volume (demand).  So don't just dream on the future of a technology, or what might be in store for BTC's adaptation in the future.  Own and trade your coins for today.  Don't ever \"believe\" in any investment as religion.",

            "Text": "In this case, it just means three previous turn-up points in trading.  These are points where the price \"briefly\" found support before it rose higher. These points will probably be retested before there is enough buyer confidence for an upward price advance in volume.  Many times a short-term price-low will be tested several times to see if it will break through to a lower low.  If it holds support, the price eventually gathers enough buyer confidence to move higher (all other fundamentals remaining stable).  \n\nA \"floor\" is formed by a relatively tight trading-range, extending over some period of time, sometimes as a sideways price movement, sometimes as a consolidation bowl, etc.  This eventually builds buyer confidence until the price can break-out to a new post-consolidation high or an ATH.  After the price breaks out to new highs, it will often slowly settle back to test the top of the previous consolidation range (the price breakout point).  If the price holds, at or above this \"floor\", it can then continue the confirmed rise with increasingly confident traders.  But if the price breaks through the floor, as it settles back to the top of the previous consolidation, then selling will increase and plunge the price back into the previous consolidation range, or even lower.  When this happens the previous \"floor\" becomes \"a ceiling\", as the trading price must fight to get back up and through the resistance it now represents.  This pressure is often caused by the action of sellers trapped above the price offer, who sell into all attempt rallies as the price reaches their bail-out points. It takes time to eat through all this overhead supply of desperate sellers and restore price confidence.  The BTC price chart would indicate that a tremendous amount of overhead supply must exist, as not everyone caught above the current price is a HODLer.",
