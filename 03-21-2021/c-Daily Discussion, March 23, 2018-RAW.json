            "Text": "Most of the ALTs are tightly linked to the big daddy's movement (Bitcoin). \n\nWhat is the point to TA the smaller coins if they will more or less take the same swings as BTC?\n\nConclusions (happy to be corrected)\n\n1) Market of ALTS is highly dependent on computer trading while the volumes are low like nowadays. It is difficult to fight with bots on ALGOs.\n\n2) BTC chart is the key and that is mostly run by the bots as well. The only ray of hope is NEW PEOPLE, NEW MONEY and increase in interest in BTC which will supress the bot trading.\n\n3) You will mostly lose against the bots in bear markets.\n\nHappy bitcoining.... (good and constructive criticism welcome)",

If we believe in bitcoin and distributed ledger, just hold and don't panic with these rides. These only add to the fun.\n\nIf you are in a hurry to get some profits, I stress, LEARN trading. LEARN / Study and Master the trading. Only then get into it otherwise you are fighting against bots and your chances are slim.\n\nFor rest of us, happy HODLING...

            "Text": "bots can manipulate crypto markets by artificially inflating the price. Their automated trading behavior leads new traders in cryptomarkets to overpay for the coins they are buying. The classic \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d scheme that was popular in the early nineties and made famous by the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is still being run effectively \u2014 by bots \u2014 in today\u2019s crypto markets. This scheme involves coordinated purchases of low-priced coin to \u201cpump\u201d the price and attract new investors who are easily excited by the increase. As investors unknowingly buy \u201cthe pump\u201d, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads \u2014 and agonizing over their wallets.\n\nUnfortunately, this scenario plays out all too often in cryptocurrency markets. As Business Insider has reported, there is no shortage of coordinated schemes where a group of traders use bots to simultaneously purchase coins to drive up price. Investors hear about the coin, get caught up in the euphoria, and buy in, hoping to make a quick profit. What they are left with is anything but.\n\nWith more and more \u201cretail\u201d investors joining the crypto space in recent weeks, chasing the Bitcoin boom, it\u2019s likely even more people will be susceptible to pump-and-dump strategies.\n\n\nHow to spot a bot\nIt can be extremely hard to detect where bots are at work without advanced analysis tools. They\u2019re easier to spot in hindsight.\nCryptocurrency markets are here to stay, and it\u2019s likely the bots are as well \u2014 as long as the market remains unregulated. There is already a large volume of trading bots operating in the market that the vast majority of investors aren\u2019t aware of. As investors become more savvy, so too will the bots. And so we\u2019re likely headed down the path of an arms race. As detection tools get stronger, developers will look for ways around detection. As bots get more advanced, platforms will accelerate research and development to counterattack. With regulation seemingly right around the corner, only time will tell which side will win the fight until the government steps in to stabilize the market and put an end to predatory bots.",

I was doing some research on bots and someone with 15 years experience in trading said that in any market do expect up to 60% of bot trading as a given.\n\nthis means that trading is big in markets. Hodlers normally have a chance when they are patient. The moment they dip into swing and day trading with little knowledge, they are more likely to get burned.\n\nJust a tip for relatively new-comers. Hope it helps.",

We colorflipped on the daily now, bouncing of a perfected TD 9 on the 4hr which was on the 200h MA. I'd say we're going up in the next days. Resistance then can be at the cross level or the upper line of this channel. ",

I think there are enough trolls here with that job already.  If you hate bitcoin so much why do you spend so much of your life trashing it here?  Seems like a waste of time to me.    \n\nOn the other hand I openly admit that I\u2019m a huge bitcoin fan. I\u2019m here because it\u2019s usually fun and sometimes even exciting.  Most of my posts are geared to cheering bitcoin on, because I want to see the price rise.   If I see anything of serious concern about bitcoin (such as the illicit material found within the blockchain) I point it out and ask questions.   All the negativity (using hyperbolic words like \u201ccollapse \u201d) can scare away new investors.       \n\nIn sum, it\u2019s fine to point out the pros and cons about bitcoin, but when all you post are cons you start to look like a troll.  Might want to rethink that strategy if you want people to give serious consideration to your point of view. ",

Despite $1.8B of trades, market cap went up by only $150m.  \n\nThe pumped up STORM is then used to trade for $446m of BTC.  Most of these trades are also mostly wash trades since total STORM is only worth $250m.  Which means BTC price is also artificially pumped up (same technique as using Tethers).",
