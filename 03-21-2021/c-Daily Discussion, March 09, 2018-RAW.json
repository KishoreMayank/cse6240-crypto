Am I one of the few that wants bitcoin to crash? Look at our world today, If u work a low paying job after being highly Educated. U will understand. System is broken. House prices keep increasing and inflation is at a all time high. Don't u want equality? Do u not crave for freedom from a system that has marginalized those that struggle while rewarding the greedy. I invest in Bitcoin and Alts for my future, for the future of all of humanity. I want each one of u. Following the price to step back. Look at what u have really Invested in. Not about the $ but the significance. As a average man or woman with Debt and struggle. We need change, we need to find our place in world driven by profit. I will not sell and I will buy more. Even when it reach's 1$ a coin. I will support bitcoin and Cryto's i believe in. We need this, U need this. Poor or Rich. A Change is required. Believe in what u invest or leave. Don't care if u crash Bitcoin prices on your way out the door. We will be stronger after.  ",

Someone thought the party was over and decided to cash out and almost drove the prices to levels seen in 2010.\"\n\nThe Gox Dump has has the same effect, but again the community has stood strong and there seems to be pressure on Nobuaki Kobayashi to deal with creditors in a less damaging way. \nIf he distributes creditors funds in fiat, it could mean that no more large sell orders effect the market.\n\nThe upshot is that in October 14 the community defeated the Whale and that reversal fed back through the market in a positive way. \n\nWe're not out of the woods yet but now it's clear that among other less damaging market factors; the Gox incident has largely been responsible for this fall, the public may again begin to rally in support of Crypto and recognise that the Crypto community remains united and stronger than these massive forced market swings.\n\nThe full article is here:\nhttps://btcmanager.com/return-of-the-bearwhale-fifth-of-mt-goxs-missing-bitcoin-dumped/",

(That's called a downside trend, unless it's to a previous leve in which case it's retracement, to a support level ... or something.)\n\n- If it was going down (up) and is now going up (down), then it's changed direction.   That's called a reversal!\n\n- And if you look at the charts from a distance, you can see all sorts of things: a head and shoulders, sometimes inverted, a wave, an Italian guy called Giuseppe, etc.   Like those people who sometimes look at a sliced potato and see the face of Elvis or some saint.

If you're overly worried all the time, maybe even sell your bitcoin next time it nears 10.5k so you can break even.\nThen, Dollar Cost Average every week with small amounts.  What this means is, that every week, you buy a small amount of Bitcoin, which is safer than buying it all at once, because you aren't buying it all at one price, so if it goes down a bit, it's alright, because the AVERAGE price you paid is going to be lower, too.\nBest of luck, I'm fairly new to this myslef!",

Unlike fiat which just get printed, btc cost money to mine and will get realy expensive when rewards halve again in 2020.",

            "Text": "Unphased - This is my first post as well and I want to give you some advice.  Find something you like to do and instead of gambling with your hard earned money, invest it in your business.  I started a small business with just $256.  I found something I thought might be a good seller and then went on ebay, Amazon and other sites to see how these items sell.  I then used the $256 to buy a small amount of these items.  They sold out in a week and I knew I had something.  I did not quit my job but continued working as I built my business.  I hit $100k in sales after three years and now 7 years after I started, I average between $175k and $200k per year.  I am the only \"employee\" and the business has decent profit margins.  There are no guarantees in life but you can do research that will better your chances of success (in my case it was seeing what kind of volume others are achieving, what keywords they were using, which products sold best for them and what types of advertisements worked for them).  I do not rest on my laurels and am constantly working to grow my business.  I also pick up some rideshare gigs when not working the business.  I play with crypto for fun but will never \"invest\" in anything more than I would in a night at a casino.  There are too many unknowns for me.  I would rather trade within a range for a 10-25% profit.  You only need to be successful a few times to double your money.  But the money you put in should be play money.  One country puts restrictions on crypto and the whole market falls 20%.  Another exchange goes down and who knows where it goes.  You say you are highly educated - use that to your advantage.  And definitely do not discount the value of hard work, even if it means multiple jobs.  My grandfather came to this country WITHOUT an education.  He served in WWII and came back to New York and took a low level job in the transit system.  He then took on a second full time job as a porter in a NYC hotel.  While he was away from home alot, he was soon able to buy a house in NY and to eventually retire comfortably.  He is now gone but his old home recently sold for $750,000.  It can be done but you need to put in the time and make sacrifices.  Whether you take my advice or not, I hope you find the success you are seeking.     ",

            "Text": "Easy money... you just have to predict that it will go up at least $1000 within your lifetime... No problem!\n\nHere's the dilemma: Where do you buy in? Anywhere? What if you bought in at $19k waiting for it to hit $20k? Welp... guess you've been waiting for months now.\n\nSay you buy in at $8890 and it just never hits $9900 for the rest of the year... Then what? Lets say it hits $9900 and you cash out your easy money... When do you buy back in? You wait for it to drop back down to $8800? What if it doesn't do that for months? If you could know where the bottom/middle of a steady rise/fall was... then you could just nonstop make money investing in crypto.\n\nThis just isn't the case. Your entire strategy relies on the price going up by $1000 within a reasonably short amount of time, so that you can sell at a nice profit... but then your plan also has to rely on the price plummeting back down so you're not buying it at $9900 or more... as it just gets more expensive and eventually will stop climbing and you'll be stuck.\n\nAlso... what currency are you selling bitcoin for? If it's not cash, then there's no guarantee the other crypto you sell to won't go down with bitcoin... in fact it's highly likely. So you can't sell BTC for say... ETH... because it will probably drop just as much.\n\nIf you're selling BTC for cash... well have fun being taxed on every profit and also eating fees on every transaction.",

            "Text": "If the amount you\u2019re getting is within the weekly limit, the fastest method IME is Coinbase debit card purchase with a big honkin\u2019 fee. Be prepared for more fees from your bank, because many banks register Coinbase as a foreign ATM. The BTC shows up immediately. Transfer your BTC to GDAX (same account credentials as Coinbase, lower transfer fees) if you intend to do anything but keep it in your Coinbase wallet.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get an amount higher than the weekly limit, you can make a purchase in Coinbase from a linked bank account; the price is locked in when you hit BUY, but the actual purchase can take several days, so the BTC won\u2019t show up immediately (but will register as a pending transfer). This is helpful if you\u2019re just trying to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d or \u201ccatch the falling knife,\u201d but don\u2019t expect to be able to cancel the sale if the price continues dropping while your purchase is pending.",

You can daily see some in the promotion  \"average cost game\"***, which goes something like this: *if you bought 1 BTC at 16K, you can't afford to sell now; but if you buy another 1 BTC at 10K, then your average cost is 13K; and you can keep buying lower to reduce your average cost*.   The person is then supposedly better of with a decreasing lower average cost, even though that does nothing to reduce the money they have put in and must then recoup somehow!.   So, instead of bailing out, the suckers keep getting in deeper!\n\n\n***Just last week there was even a thread arguing that lower prices are a great opportunity for those who bought at 17K!   ",

            "Text": "Wrong.   First, you assume that people will always want it.   When the whole pyramid collapses, nobody will want it, so the value of a BTC will simply go down to close to $0.   Nobody will want to put effort, time, and money into mining something that nobody wants and is willing to pay for.\n\n\nSecond, the difficulty does not always go up.  The general trend is that overall it has been going up, but the system is built to make it adjustable.   In fact, if you look closely at the graph, even in just the last could of years, you can see it go up and down although mostly up.    ",

I believe that the Block chain is a technology that will forever change the world, given enough faith and support from a dedicated community. Bitcoin is just a gateway and thus will remain a staple, an innovator that introduced the world to new age of Fintech. I have no doubt bitcoin will become a storage of wealth eventually, even if the overall worth is less than what people predict. I want to support this movement. It is a change in the global landscape that i hope people can see. It is not a get rich quick scheme. Rather a change, in the way wealth is distributed and managed. A hope for people towards a better future. This is my small way of contributing. I admire each one of those that have invested in this movement not just for gains, however far something greater. ",

However, My crypto is a investment in the future. A hope and faith that my tiny bit of investment will feed innovation that will disrupt a industry that has bled countless innocent people with no alternative choice.

Anyone who puts money into BTC is a fool and fully deserves to lose that money.\n\n> The tech is really useful if (BIG IF) it becomes adopted by the mainstream. I think discounting that possibility is a real missed opportunity. \n\nIf the the technology, you mean blockchain, then, yes.   That is possibly quite useful.  But the adoption of blockchain does not require bitcoin of any of the funny monies floating around.    Anybody who is investing in BTC on the basis of the promise of the underlying technology is likewise a fool who should be parted with his money.   However, in this case perhaps less of a fool, because it takes some reflection to realize that a blockchain is just a data structure that could be put to all sorts of uses.    ",

It will have no relevance to other \"outside\" uses of blockchain, and that is already evident out there.  \n\nFurther, first-mover advantage only goes so far.   At some point, if others are able to do it better, cheaper, faster, etc., then it doesn't matter.   In fact, China has made a whole economy from just two of the three!",
