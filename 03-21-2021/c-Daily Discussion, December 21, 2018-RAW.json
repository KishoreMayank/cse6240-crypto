Powerful businesspeople say it. Elite athletes say it. Investors with a track record of smart decision-making say it; \u201cConsistency is the key to success.\u201d\n\nIn cryptocurrency, many investors say bitcoin is a store of value, a digital version of gold. But bitcoin doesn\u2019t behave like gold \u2013 offering a stable way to hold value long-term. Bitcoin often seems like a pretty inconsistent and manipulated market. For example, why does bitcoin trade at a penny tick size on most major cryptocurrency exchanges?\n\n\u2018Tick size\u2019 is a term meant to refer to the minimum quoting and trading amount available on an exchange. When bitcoin was worth a few dollars, a penny tick size made sense. When bitcoin was worth $100, penny ticks were reasonable.\n\nAt over $1,000, it creates problems. It disincentivizes standing orders while incentivizing volatility.\n\nImagine this scenario: Bitcoin is trading at $3,500.03. A human trader puts in a limit order to buy at $3,500.00. An automated trading system then \u201cpenny jumps\u201d the human trader by putting in a small buy order at $3,500.01.\n\nThe systemized trader\u2019s order will get filled first.\n\nAutomated cryptocurrency trading systems take comfort in these scenarios. This is because the orders of human traders need to get filled before they lose money. Therefore, systemized trades will always be one step ahead of any human with such small spreads. This happens constantly on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHigh-volume bitcoin traders are using systemization algorithms. The average trader is using manual or simple bot orders. These are not as easily adjustable on the fly to the whims of low tick sizes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nBitcoin behaves unlike any other financial asset many have ever traded.\n\nMost people buying financial assets try to get the highest quantity for the lowest price possible. Bitcoin is often the opposite, however. Traders try to buy the least amount possible at a higher price.\n\nThis is especially true with one penny ticks because of a combination of small order sizes and tiny spreads.\n\n## This Has Been Studied Before\n\nIn the foreign exchange market and equities markets, there is some precedent to changing tick sizes.\n\nForex markets, for example, decided to do an experiment: Lower overall tick size for currencies from what\u2019s called a pip (0.0001) to decimal pip (0.00001).\n\nThe result? More high frequency traders with computerized algorithms \u201cjumping\u201d regular traders. This created uneven pricing, as basic bots and human traders simply don\u2019t account for more decimals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe SEC also did a review of this. They [performed a tick size pilot](https://www.sec.gov/ticksizepilot) involving small cap stocks. Results show increased depth, but decreased price quality. In addition, the depth increase appears to be related to large market orders. Crypto doesn\u2019t entail millions of dollars in trades very often \u2013 that is executed in over-the-counter, not the spot market.\n\nImagine, for instance, that tick sizes for crypto were even lower than a penny. This would mean more opportunity for advanced HFT and less for retail traders. Conversely, having higher tick sizes would mean better trading advantages to average investors.\n\nThe larger the tick, the better for trading \u2013 which is obtaining highest quantity for the lowest price, as mentioned about. The smaller the tick, the worse pricing average traders/investors get.\n\n## A Call to Crypto Exchanges\n\nExchanges should take heed as changing tick sizes clearly isn\u2019t a crazy idea. In fact, it\u2019s something that should be experimented with given the nature of crypto as a new era in finance. Indeed, having a larger tick size in crypto isn\u2019t unprecedented. CME, for example, [lists bitcoin futures with a $5 tick size](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-futures-cme-terms-2017-11).\n\nAdding inefficiencies to the market, sounds like existing banking, doesn\u2019t it? Some may argue increased spreads are bad because it creates profit for middlemen who don\u2019t actually do anything.\n\nActually, spreads in markets do serve a purpose. There is no specific rule on this per se. (Only the wisdom that optimal spreads should be as tight as possible). This means bids and asks should be close together while still attracting enough liquidity on either side of it to transact.\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that right now, one penny spreads in bitcoin do not attract enough liquidity to transact at the best bid and offer. There\u2019s just a bunch of jumping going on, with orders placed and removed all the time. This is why small tick sizes are really hard to understand from a trading point of view.\n\nIncreasing bitcoin\u2019s tick size from one penny to $0.50 or $1 would go a long way in leveling the playing field for human traders. It would also increase the cost for traders currently penny jumping and manipulating the overall price.\n\nPactum Capital focuses on cryptocurrency trading and market making. Our firm is sometimes several percentage points of daily volume on regulated U.S. exchanges. But, bitcoin\u2019s tick sizes are continually perplexing to us.\n\nSo, why does bitcoin still trade with a penny tick size on most major exchanges?\n\nIt\u2019s a question we\u2019d like to see answered in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Just like how a pizza cost 10,000 btc a few years ago and today we spend less than 0.01 btc. If Bitcoin is desired its value will rise as the units become more scarce, and its increase in value incentives people not to lose it. In the past one might have wrote off a loss of 1 btc in a locked wallet, but today most will go to great lengths to recover a single bitcoin. ",
