            "Text": "2 word transposition can be brute forced in fractions of seconds, and I am pretty sure there are already programs out there simply trying every imaginable combination of transpositions, switches and flips which can possibly be learned by heart, and it won't take a second to list them all.\n\nSo your transposing is pretty much useless with a serious thief, might work for an evil relative though - unless they seek advice from a nerd.\n\nEdit: this is what I use for things I need to keep safe: there is that one odd and silly sentence from my very early childhood I know I will never forget because it's burnt into my brain forever. I use that as a passphrase for a modern encryption algorithm. Edit2: of course you need a computer for that, and if you don't trust your internet connected devices, you will need an airgapped device to do the encryption. And make sure your passphrase doesn't get written to the disk, or better, use a device with OS from a RO device and RAM disks. Security is hard. \n\nEdit3: \n\n> separate cryogenic storage of the seed and numbers transposed with three separate company's\n\nAs I wrote above, this is useless because the company holding your transposed phrase is the company holding the faith of your bitcoin. Seriously, encryption by transposing is cracked since the roman empire.\n\nSo if you go the route of three separate companies, then split your seed into three junks of equal size and store one junk with each company, if you want to take advantage of paying for 3 companies at all.

That's why the Chinese government stepped in and ordered them out of HK.  Don't shoot me for FUD ... as I said, it's just rumours here in Asia.",
