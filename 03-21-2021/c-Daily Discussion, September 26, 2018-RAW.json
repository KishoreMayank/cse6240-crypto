But, if he tweets, \u201cI bought some Bitcoin and will work with SEC to approve Bitcoin ETF.\u201d Bitcoin will skyrocket. If he tweets \u201cBitcoin is a threat to world order and democracy and it\u2019s very suspect.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s price will fall. Obviously, Trump has the ability to influence stock prices as we have witnessed directly from his Chinese tariffs/trade wars and indirectly via his day-to-day sentiment in the form of tweets. So, Trump has the ability to influence Bitcoin price based on the message from his tweet.",

But if Bakkt is successful, they will bring new buyers into the market, which means an increase in demand. Since the supply rate of Bitcoin is very inelastic, an increase in demand should lead to an increase in price.\n\nBut I'm worried about Wall Street shenanigans. We don't need them involved for Bitcoin to fulfill its promise of becoming a decentralized, border-less, censorship resistant, sound money. Wall Street may provide a short-cut to a sharp increase in price, but to me, it feels like it might be a deal with the devil, and we might give up a lot more than we realize. These Wall Street suits have been playing this game for a long time, and they have become exceedingly good at it.",

The fact that you\u2019re signifying elimination of ISIS is laughable and really shows your delusion so much that I won\u2019t even get into that with you. The record stock market and record low unemployment was all inherited from Obama\u2019s efforts. Basically, you could\u2019ve put a monkey in office in 2017 and would\u2019ve gotten the same results. And mentioning tax cuts makes you a serious dipshit...oh a teacher making $28,000/yr gets a $16/month tax cut thanks to Trump. Whoopey Doo. Meanwhile, corporations and billionaires get billions of $$ in tax cuts and a much larger break than poor people. How is it they don\u2019t pay their fair share in taxes and poor and middle school pay great percentages? I can you\u2019re completely a Trump-loving irrational person that really thinks Trump has made America great again making fun of women, handicap people, Mexicans, Muslims, war veterans like John McCain...but of course you support Trump because you\u2019re a spineless little weasel.",
