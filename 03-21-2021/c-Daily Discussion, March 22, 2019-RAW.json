All I see on Twitter is that we have to go to 3500-3700 because people think if they draw lines on a chart then somehow that will move the price to there, These TA people are idiots!

            "Text": "With what's happening in traditional markets, especially bond markets, you'd have to be completely stupid to not be buying -- or, worse, selling -- Bitcoin right now.\n\nEDIT -- let me explain further:\n\n[Yield curves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp) are officially inverted.  The **1 month** *Treasury pays a higher rate of interest than the 10-year Treasury*.  What this means is that the longer-term bonds are essentially worthless, or worth pennies on their nominal dollar value.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  The corporate paper market is even more distorted.\n\nWho holds long-term Treasuries?  Banks.  \n\nWhat happens when you use your credit card or go to the ATM:  The bank makes an entry on its ledger.  To keep these ledgers solvent (or to give them the appearance of solvency), banks basically float massive checks to each other in the form of [interbank loans](http://www.investorwords.com/15492/interbank_loan.html).  What is likely to happen in that market when trust erodes due to everyone knowing that everyone else's balance sheet is like a gigantic sheet of toilet paper?  Calls will be made.  \n\nI'm telling you, the day will come when you will try to use your card, and it won't work because your bank won't have the money to cover the ledger entry or give you cash.  That day is coming.  It may come next week or it may come three months from now, but -- make no mistake -- it's coming.  When that day comes, you'll be very glad you bought Bitcoin.  ",

            "Text": "It's not all shit, but 90 percent of it is, especially when applying traditional TA to this market.  This is a completely different market based almost solely on supply and demand.  In traditional markets, people look at news, rumors, announcements and balance sheets along with TA.  In this market, one whale deciding to drop a measly $20 million on BTC (or a bear dumping $100 million) can cause a sizeable spike upward (or downward) that will invalidate whatever your TA is saying.  Or an exchange could get nervous about its supply and start buying.  Or some weird derivative could expire.  Or a short needs to pay back the BTC they borrowed.  Etc.\n\nMy favorite formation is the one I named -- the First Rule of Holes.  This is when a big, dumb, obviously borrowed dump slowly becomes unprofitable based on low retail volume.  It shows that demand is high and tempts bears to dump again even though they're swimming upstream against the market -- which we want them to do so that more people can get more cheap coins before the wheels come off in the traditional financial system.",

            "Text": ">2. Sellers know they will make it dump at some point and buy back cheap\n\nThe thing about that is it is only worth doing if \"they\" think that the price will in the long term go up.\n\nSo for a while \"they\" dump and then buy back cheap, and that works. But then it reaches a state where \"they\" dump and buy back at essentially the same price. How do \"they\" know when that state is reached, well \"they\" don't until they try it.\n\nThe last dump which stayed down for any significant time was about a month ago (Feb24), since then the price has come back up quite quickly each time, so if \"they\" are doing 2, then it is getting less profitable.",
