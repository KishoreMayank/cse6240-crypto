At my office white elephant gift exchange, I gave someone a paper wallet containing .001 bitcoin. Nobody knew what it was, and only a handful of the 50 or so people there had even heard of bitcoin. It just reminds me that not everyone in glued to this subreddit, or the price charts on gdax like a lot of us. At this point, if you have any bitcoin, you are an early adopter. There is so much more room for growth.",

I would call that a hefty 25% correction and consolidation. If you can\u2019t tell the corrections are becoming tighter and quicker because of demand to buy and make money.\n\nI would say we are due for a week or a couple weeks of growth now. 25-30k by New Years with a correction to 20-23k after and consolidation around 24-26 for a week.\n\nJust look at the chart. Goes up for a while, consolidates/corrects, then goes up for a while, consolidates/corrects. It\u2019s a pattern and an upward trend. ",

Eg. Rather than sell BTC for USD to invest in a CD, stocks, or a mutual fund, can you just move BTC to another investment?",

The fees would be heavy as my bank would also charge me to convert into euros.

            "Text": "Hey guys and gals,\n\nIn this wee little post ill explain why im scaling back my btc standings either by taking some profits or hedging against it.\n\nNow, I love btc. Its great, it\u2019s the OG and face of the whole crypto market but it has some serious problems. Its slow, expensive, inflated af and bad for the environment.\n\nLong term: scalability and mining. I\u2019m one of those people that thinks that the block size should have been doubled. We\u2019re not yet at a stage where block size is an issue (I could be wrong) and lightning network wont be out for a while so why not have a small, short term improvement? Mining uses a crazy amount of power, tons of co2. Not great at all. This along with scalability will have to be fixed before mainstream adoption.\n\nShort term: tether. Put your tin foil hats on cos im a firm believer in tether blowing up major time real soon. Around $1bn has been printed so far and with each tether being usable multiple times, im betting tethers existance has blown bitcoins price way up. When the tether cancer is dealt with, the lack of tether will cause a crash, the scandal will fuel the crash. With a lot of talk of bitcoin in mainstram media, tether blowing up will be amplified massively. People will start screaming how they knew all along that it was a scam and blah blah blah. That\u2019s probably when ill buy back in.\n\nFor now however, im probably gonna take some profits and treat myself for crimbo or find a hedge against bitcoin for the short term.\n\nNow guys, rip me to shreds. Tell me why im an idiot or support my views but I need some outside opinion so lay into me.\n",

It looked like it was just a straight up pump and dump rally from my perspective.  The timing was perfect for it, BTC getting gains and mass media exposure, at the same time people complaining about high fees and slow transaction times and lastly Litecoin being viewed by new entrants as more affordable due to lower cost/coin because they don't always understand you don't have to own a full coin.  Perfect setup for somebody to start a pump/dump rally.",

            "Text": "> To understand 'walls' you have to understand the concept of an order book.\n> \n> When you put in an order to buy or sell bitcoin, you can put in a market order (buy/sell at the current price) or you can specify the price you're willing to pay/take.\n> \n> So if I want to buy 1 BTC but I don't want to pay more than $250 for it, I can put that order in. As soon as someone else puts in a matching order (someone is willing to sell any amount of BTC for <$250/coin), the two orders match and complete. My money is exchanged for the other guy's bitcoin.\n> \n> When dealing with a actual exchange, you can put these orders in and leave them in for a long time. They will sit on the order book until they fill. This allows trading to occur when not all traders are in front of their terminals. For example, I could put in a sell order that will execute if the price spikes above a certain point. This order stays on the books and if a spike happens while I'm not looking, it'll get me out and I make profit. Or for example I might want to capitalize on a 'flash crash' by putting in a buy order for significantly lower than market value. As I'm sure you can see, there are risks and advantages to all of this.\n> \n> Now let's say I'm a whale (someone who makes a big splash when they trade). I want in on cheap coins, so I say that I want to buy 15,000 BTC at $250/coin and I put in an order accordingly. That means that for the price of BTC on that exchange to drop below $250, a whole bunch of sellers will have to unload up to 15k BTC first. Until that happens, anyone that tries to sell will keep matching with my buy order and the market price will stay at $250. Or I could see the price moving and decide to cancel my order, at which point the wall disappears.\n> \n> The order book is usually presented visually, somewhat like this. The current market price is in the middle, and the sloping walls represent the orders at various prices. The angle of the slope represents how many orders must be filled / how many coins change hands for the market price to move to a particular point.\n> \n> And that's where the 'wall' comes in. My whale 15,000 BTC order will show up as an almost vertical segment on the order book chart. Notice the orange line is vertical at about $3.90 on that chart, going from 10k to 20k? That means someone put in an order to buy 10,000 bitcoins at $3.90. Before the price can go lower than 3.90, people selling have to first sell 10,000 bitcoins to get the price down to $3.90, then another 10,000 bitcoins to that one guy to get the price down below 3.90.\n> \n> Does that make sense?\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ief3s/can_somebody_please_explain_sell_walls_and_all/",

            "Text": "In the simplest and quickest of terms, Bitcoin Cash solution to scaling (ensuring everyone's transactions are very cheap and quick) is to increase the block size. In my opinion this is a shortsighted and short-term fix and it also leads to centralization (which is very bad because you hand over control to a few central corporations/banks that run nodes and confirm transactions). If you keep increasing the block size, regular people will not be able to afford to run nodes due to the sheer size of the block and the amount of bandwidth required. Segwit is a fundamental layer solution where not all transactions (tiny ones, like buying coffee, etc) end up on the main block chain. Segwit opens doors to future scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network which makes small transfers even more viable in terms of price per transaction and time to confirm the transaction. Segwit and future scaling solutions are long term solutions and keep Bitcoin decentralized and open to everyone.  This is just my quick laymen explanation glossing over the hurdles of implementation and other details..",

People who hodled large quantities of coins are realizing their moons before the holiday while demand is down because the average man with spare money to invest in crypto is giving it to retail stores at the minute. Combine that with the fact that we're at hyper FUD levels in the media, it's really a miracle that the price is holding let alone slowly rising. Expect LARGE gains after the holidays. HODLERs will be rewarded again as it's been shown countless times throughout the history of this currency. ",

Obviously to buy more and instantly make money when the correction is over. It\u2019s a game. Do NOT fall for the game. \n\nIn September China was potentially going to ban exchanges. But on reddit you would have seen people saying \u201cit\u2019s bull shit don\u2019t fall for it\u201d yet people fell for it and the price went from 5k to 3k.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take notes about events and price fluctuations so next time you\u2019re prepared. Since 2017 began  bitcoin has had a number of  periods of doubling, 50-80% increases over a week, etc. but every time it skyrockets, it corrects/consolidates/breathes for a bit. Every single time.

As someone that\u2019s not invested either community very heavily, I just don\u2019t seem to get it. As I understand it BCH or whatever you wish to call it is a \u201cfork\u201c (not sure if I\u2019m using that term correctly) of bitcoin and copied the block chain. So as a derivative it would seem the derivative name is appropriate if used consistently. There are those that seem to want to rebrand it as \u201cThe\u201d Bitcoin and refer to BTC as something else. \n\nFor someone just learning about coin, it would be akin to how there\u2019s multiple currencies called dollar. There is the US Dollar and the Canadian Dollar among others for example, and which one a person means when they say Dollar can vary, hence the need for consistency and being on the same page. This looks like a similar thing to me. The important thing is that you and the person you\u2019re talking to both know exactly which coin or currency you\u2019re talking about. \n\n\n",

It is an app that will take your info from exchanges and wallets and keep track of your trades and profit/loss in your phone. The data is not stored anywhere but your phone. Now since it needs access to your exchange and wallet info to do this, it is asking for the api key and that it be set to read only. Would it be safe to do this or could this compromise my wallets and exchange info?",

Essentialy the price on a certain exchange cannot go up until the sell order is filled. Meaning if someone wants to sell 1000 bitcoins at 17k, the price will stay at 17k until all of the 1000 are sold. And while those are selling, others may add more sell orders as well.",

I thought deutsche bank would fail, all these derivatives would crash the financial system, and what happened? DB doubled, QE continued and the stock market goes to all time highs, due to the 24/7 money printing.  I know its hard, but gold/silver are rigged daily on the LBMA and we don't even know how much silver/gold is out there. And we can just mine billions of more ounces on asteroids, moon, which would increase the supply 100000x ( or whatever that % is).  But with bitcoin, we know only 21 million will ever be mined, but already 4 million have been lost and daily, only about 5 million change hands. So its price, in usd, will keep going up. CME futures on sunday night, will push it ever further. Most futures accounts need margin of 5x the amount of btc to go short, while you need to only put up 1/2 btc to go long. Everyone wants a piece of this new asset. And also, when was the last time a commodity was listed on the futures exchange? 40 years ago, so this is a totally new asset, a new play toy for Wall Street, they will pump the shit out of it, they blow up every bubble, larger and larger...",
