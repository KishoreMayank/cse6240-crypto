High volatility appeals to traders but not to serious investors such as 401ks, indexes and ETFs. They want steady, sustainable growth without many surprises.\n\nThus, most corporations and platforms have had a hands-off attitude toward BTC. If there was a consistently steady track record, then they wouldn't care that they don't understand it -- much like how people are unbothered by not being well-versed in the intricacies of the Internet's infrastructure and protocols. But to be both volatile (wildly so, it's penny-stock volatile) and completely mysterious? Too much for them to handle.\n\nThe thing is, *we need their money* to help BTC get to 100K per coin. Wall Street's involvement should bring legitimacy and self-assurance to the mainstream in due time. In other words, HODL",

            "Text": "I have what might be considered a noobish question, but I'm finding it difficult to find the answer to this in an FAQ.\n\nAs I understand it, the blockchain is basically a ledger of all transactions ever made with Bitcoin - sending address, receiving address, and Bitcoin amount. Full nodes validate the entire blockchain; lightweight SPV clients do not, and have to ask a third-party server.\n\nI also note that it's recommended to generate a new address for each transaction, for privacy purposes, so people can't learn which addresses belong to you.\n\nMy question is, how can a full node validate the blockchain if new addresses are routinely generated? In other words, if there's a transaction from address A to address B, and then a brand new address C appears sending bitcoin to address D, how can it be validated that address C actually got that bitcoin from address B as opposed to making it up?\n\nDo bitcoins themselves have an ID of sorts? And if so, wouldn't this give away the fact that addresses B and C belong to the same person?\n\nI'm so sorry for this question but it seems surprisingly difficult to find an answer in an FAQ.",

I\u2019m very confused about how these will actually impact Bitcoin itself, these seem like an unrelated entity that is based on Bitcoin, but I don\u2019t understand how Futures will impact Bitcoin itself. \n\n2. What exactly is Lightning and what will it do for Bitcoin? I have read a little bit, but I am unsure what Lightning will do. I know it will make transactions faster, but I neither know how it will accomplish this nor how this will impact the value of Bitcoin itself. \n\n3. Why Bitcoin and not any other cryptocurrency? Everyone is saying that Bitcoin is the future, but why won\u2019t any other cryptocurrency surpass it? Will Bitcoin emerge victorious and, if so, why?\n\nThis seems like an awesome idea. I wanted to invest two weeks ago, but I always like to do my research before I invest. Sadly that research costed me a lot, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry. ",

I thought then the consumption is 98 W/Th and therefore 1323W/13.5TH. Watt is J/s and therefore it should consume 1323 W/s. So 1.323 kW/s, which would mean 114307KW/day. Assuming price of eletricity= 0.05cent/khw i would pay 5715 euros/day???? I know i miscalculated something, but i don't know what. If someone could please clear thing up. Thanks\n",

According to http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/2017/12/05/upcoming-bitcoin-forks-2017-2018/ there are several happening in the next few days.  I have a small amount in Coinbase already cleared, and some more purchases that I made on Dec 7 that supposedly are stuck in ACH clearing hell until the 14th.  Should I move what I have out now before the fork?  Will I miss out on the Bitcoin Platinum fork on the 12th since Coinbase is holding that purchase?  I have a Ledger Nano S coming but I don\u2019t know if will arrive before the 12, worried that I should transfer what I have to a Paper wallet now?",

            "Text": "Hi,\n\nSo as I understand it miners get rewarded occasionally with Bitcoin.  The mining activity is also what powers the block chain to enable the recording of transactions.  There are a finite number of Bitcoins that will be issued and the difficulty level is adjusted to maintain a desired rate of issuance.\n\nSo my question, once all 21M Bitcoins have been mined.  The miners will scale back operations / switch to other coins.  The transaction commit time on the block chain will balloon, potentially to a point where there is not capacity to keep up with new transactions - the whole ability to keep commiting transactions to the chain / keeping up with new transactions could go to zero.  Bitcoin would effectively cease to have any utility as a medium of change of value because the block chain infrastructure to move the bitcoins around had imploded.\n\nUnless I am missing something, the 21M limit which many see as a source of scarcity that underpins the lofty current market price is actually ultimately incompatible with the goal of becoming a mainstream stable currency is in fact the hard limit in the number of the coins.\n\nWhat am I missing, I assume Bitcoin aims to be a currency and in that end the 21M and deflationary nature of that which is also causing increase in the market price of Bitcoin is the very thing that is causing this to become a Tulip bubble and will ultimately destroy / prevent Bitcoin replacing FIATs.\n\nWould it not be better to have a coin with unlimited coins that can be minted but where a block chain of \"trusted mints\" have to hold $ reserves in a pooled account that enables them to act as a central bank and purchase back the currency in exchange for the original $ deposited (less transaction fees).  While this would clearly not be as much fun  / sky rocketting value as it would effectively be pegged to a number of large currencies.  It would however surely provide a much better foundation for a currency to facilitate the exchange of goods and service with a convenient electronic currency of stable value / very low volatility.\n\nSo what is it that I have got backwards?",

Coinbase and gdax are not an option for me (cointry restrictions, Russian).\n\nMy aim is to move half my BTC to some exchange to trade using some part of it (margin trading most likely) according to market momentum after futures being offered. \n\nIn general, does that seem like a good strategy? I converted like 10% of my savings to BTC recently and it seems that if there's a negative momentum I won't be able to respond to it in time. But I will be when using an exchange (since trades there are quicker and have less fees than if I tried to convert to fiat elsewhere). Thanks!",

I must say it is a dump FUD, dump idea. Everybody need to know that BTC future:\n\n- Settle at specific date, usually weeks or months after the contract is open, so no dump whales will try to crash the BTC at the start of the BTC future and face the risk of price jummping back on the Expired Date. That is just not logic at all.                                                            \n\nThe price correction from 2 days ago is very good for BTC in the long term. First of all now we are building some supports on the way down. Secondly, we corrected to Fibo 78.6% and bound back with good volume too, it means somehow we reached the Bottom for this correction. What is greater when BTC Future open, and BTC price is at the bottom of a correction? People will FOMO in soon and push the price to ATH again. I even short BTC ratio vs another Alts at the moment since when we going up again, it will be a nightmare for all Alts.",

FIAT certainly has some credibility issues in this regard as well as it is based on escalating debt, interest payments and issuing of government bonds to keep the wheels spinning.  While constantly printing money and devaluing \"proper\" currency...\n\nWhile this system appears on the face of it to work since Nikon decoupled the US$ from exchange for gold.  I do somewhat take exception to the assertion that FIAT is somehow magically underpinned by something greater.\n\nBut I guess in addition to manipulating gold prices through money printing, the system does want anyone to start thinking too much about what is actually behind the magic green curtain propping up normal currencies....",

Let me first say that I do believe in the block chain and bitcoin's overall purpose; I think it's moving a bit too fast to sustain itself though. My belief is that while bitcoin does have a future the recent surge is most likely a bubble. It will take time to integrate bitcoin into everyday life for most people. Bitcoin can't keep up this kind of exponential growth without it reliably storing value or being accepted in most places as currency. Right now it seems (to most people) to be totally speculative.

And honestly it would be crazy to bet agains bitcoin unless there is some heavy manipulation. But keep in mind bitcoin was unregulated till tomorrow. Now it is entering regulated mainstream waters. Which means if somebody manipulates the market on purpose can actually go to jail.  Also people were not investing into btc because they were not sure if it is gonn be legal or banned. In the begging people in usa were also getting arrested in some cases for getting involved with bitcoins. Now going on wall street it means bitcoin became officially  legal in USA. For example coin base could not sell btc in states of NY , Hawaii and a few others. So in tha long run bitcoin will go up like crazy now when official , big money, legal investors get into the game. So lets wait for tomorrow. But this might be just a game to scare people to sell their bitcoins for the last time before the rocket ship takes off to the sky. Any opinions on this? Do u expect big players will short or buy bitcoins tomorrow? ",

I knew it was all over when people started saying we couldn't use the old metrics (PE ratios etc.) to value the \"new economy\" players. When I started hearing nutters suggesting that we needed to value businesses based on multiples of cash (reserves) they held, I knew it was time to get in the bunker. \n\nWe seem to be here now with Bitcoin. It is slow, expensive, insecure and incredibly inefficient. It is 9 years old and cannot handle, what could only be described as, miniscule transaction volumes. It is impractical for transactional use. The divergent interests of miners, investors, speculators and developers mean that evolution is going to be difficult if not impossible. \n\nThere might be plenty of bubble left. But talk about Bitcoin reaching 100k, 500k or 1m, based on any share of global economic activity is just insanity. It's the 'multiples of cash' lunacy of 2000. \n\nIt's time to deploy the lifeboats.",

You hold your private keys; completely mitigating the possibility of losing them to something that is out of your control.\n\nIf you are planning on trading with your small amount of BTC I would recommend keeping it on the market.

Bitcoin and crypto-currencies are a new standard that don't yet have any regulated rules.... so futures tomorrow could crash bitcoin to a few thousand dollars or it could skyrocket prices. Lightning from what I've read is more or less going to make the process of receiving and distributing bitcoin much safer and more efficient while making it a faster process too. Of course that's an ELI5 but that's the gist. In terms of the third question, Bitcoin is the one that exploded and has the most momentum right now. Not many people even know what Bitcoin is though, so how would the other, smaller currencies take off if the most popular crypto has a hard time getting its name out there? It was the first and normally that plays a huge factor in terms of being successful.\n",

So you would owe taxes on that $2500 of income.  You would not owe taxes on the remaining 0.5 BTC that you have, until you sell it.",

A \"currency\" that naturally gains value due to artificial scarcity is absolutely not sustainable for any commercial transactions. That's why it's basically only used to buy drugs online, which is its only advantage over fiat right now. Once people realize that the FBI uses this nifty tech (cough Palantir cough) to rapidly match bank transactions to monitored wallets involved in darknet deals, they'll start realizing that it's not even good for that anymore.\n\nJust fair warning.",

I'll try to use an analogy to make it more clear.\n\nImagine you have a shovel and you're standing on a lake which is iced over. If you chip at the ice once or twice (sell small amounts of BTC), then a new layer of ice will regrow overnight (new BTC buyers arrive) and the lake stays frozen.\n\nNow, if you take that shovel and bash the ice layer (sell a huge amount of BTC), one of two things might happen. If the ice is thick enough, it will remain solid and unbreaking.\n\nIf the ice is fairly thin, it will crack, and you'll be shoveling mud before long! This is essentially what you see happening in the market.\n\nSome large seller came in and tried to sell a whole lot of BTC at the market. There weren't enough buyers at that exact price to absorb the selling, so the price dropped until the market found enough buyers to fill the seller's order. ",

In fact, (and correct me if I'm wrong here) with the current amount of mining going on, the network would stay secure even if a global adoption of Bitcoin was to occur. That is, we do not need more miners even as Bitcoin grows.\n\nThe other thing to understand, and which might be more important, is the fact that although mining requires quite a lot of energy, one needs to recognize that it secures the network. It will replace what is probably a MUCH larger use of energy that's being used today to secure money and transactions, which for example constitutes of guns, vaults, manpower, electricity etc etc. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCAJusk3dz4\n\nFor anyone interested in Bitcoin/cryptocurrency/technologies related to it, who has questions like the one OP asked, I would recommend listening to a few of Andreas's talks. He will answer those questions, and many more, in a very clear and precise manner, helping you better understand the actual amazing potential that this technology has.",

It's basically a fiat currency.\n\nThink of the shift when the US switched from the Gold standard to fiat. Some might call that a scam too.\n\nSo the fact that Tether can keep this up indefinitely and that it makes up a small % of the BTC market cap I would say it's something to keep an eye out for, but not a show stopper. Could definitely cause a large short term crash though if they go insolvent (read: buying opportunity).",

            "Text": "They are similar. BCH was born as a new fork of the original BTC chain. The BCH camp wanted to keep bitcoin from upgrading. This ensured all transactions remain on chain and that the only way to scale is to increase block sizes. As miners get money from transaction fees you can imagine why all the big miner groups liked bitcoin the way it was. The legacy BTC chain upgraded a few features to start to pave the way for off chain scaling solutions. This will allow users to spend bitcoin instantly with lower fees but ultimately pegged to the main chain. As miners get less transactions on the main chain to process, they get less fees, so they didn\u2019t like bitcoin. They forked, and set up BCash which is about 10-20% of BTC value. \nYou can tell what the market wanted. ",

Bitcoin only has value as long as people believe it is valuable -and I mean bitcoin not the technology in general...\n\nThere are limited quantities availible . Its an option for wealthy people to store value while avoiding tax, all while being able to claim noble motives that may or may not apply. While there are multiple good block chain currencys only a few can reach the moon ( just like there are lots of artists but only one picasso ) . What does this mean ? Well in my eyes if hopes are high and talk is positive there will be n ,ew buyers and value will increase . So everyone lighten the heck up and enjoy the ride",

Uber shouldn\u2019t have any value because there are tons of other ride sharing companies. Facebook shouldn\u2019t have any value because any developer can launch another social network. \n\nI understand what you are saying about the scarcity. Technically you could fork bitcoin and have another coin that also allows 21 million (like Bcash), but that does not mean it is going to have the same brand recognition, network effect, number of users, number of miners, etc.\n\nThere are already thousands of crypto currencies, and none of them are even close to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap.",

([here's one](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UBUfx.jpg))\n\nThink of the green part as the demand for BTC in USD.  On the left side of the graph, the price is low, so people want to buy lots of BTC.  As the price goes up (toward the right) there are fewer people wanting to buy it at that price.   Eventually the price gets too high, so the number of people wanting to buy is zero.\n\nThe red is the supply.  Along the right side of the graph, the price is high so tons of people want to sell.  As you move toward the left, the price lowers, so fewer people are interested in selling.  Eventually the price gets too low for sellers, so nobody wants to sell any, making the supply zero.\n\nWhere the two lines intersect is the point of equilibrium, where there is a buyer happy with the price paid and a seller happy with the price received.  Here is where a trade happens.  This intersection is the current market price.",

            "Text": "38. [4:19 PM] ANON##: so thus, i have to buy bitcoin or keep a reserve for it to buy any coin or ico\n39. [4:19 PM] ANON##: this is the last surviving use case of bitcoin\n40. [4:19 PM] ANON##: otherwise it isn't even a store of value at this point\n41. [4:19 PM] ANON##: it is a store of speculation\n42. [4:20 PM] ANON##: it is also too unstable and slow for banks to use it, although they are very interested in the blockchain since it is much faster than bank transfers, more reliable, and whatever fee even $1000 beats 30% of all your capital transferred\n43. [4:20 PM] ME##:: why do you buy Storj coin?\n44. [4:20 PM] ANON##: thus banks use Ripple, which is centrally controlled\n45. [4:20 PM] ANON##: this is just an example of me having to use a reserve currency to buy another altcoin\n46. [4:20 PM] ANON##: the majority of altcoins of course do not have USD fiat transfer\n47. [4:20 PM] ANON##: so when altcoins grow, bitcoin grows too. since people need to use it to buy the altcoin\n48. [4:21 PM] ANON##: just like you must have us dollar for oil, even iran and china do so\n49. [4:21 PM] ANON##: however, one altcoin is very different. Ethereum, it allows other cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to be built on it\n50. [4:21 PM] ANON##: if you look at coin market cap, the majority of the lesser coins are actually ethereum cryptotokens\n51. [4:22 PM] ANON##: from ICOs and stuff. these cryptotokesn can emulate any financial instrument, stocks, bonds, voting\n52. [4:22 PM] ANON##: thus, they are automatically denominated in ethereum\n53. [4:22 PM] ANON##: it's what you need to participate in icos. for the same reason, most exchanges also provide fiat exchange to ethereum\n54. [4:23 PM] ANON##: so since bitcoin (and it's token substrate USDT) has been too slow to use as the reserve currency outside of an exchange, i use ethereum to transfer my value instead\n55. [4:23 PM] ANON##: most people have the same idea too\n56. [4:23 PM] ANON##: so if bitcoin were to fail it would not be litecoin or bitcoin cash that would take its place, but ethereum\n57. [4:24 PM] ANON##: since bitcoin is only has that pracitcal use case of a reserve currency left, but it's not even doing a good job of that\n58. [4:24 PM] ME##:: thank god Bcash wouldnt take over, the guy who started the fork is an absolute cock\n59. [4:25 PM] ANON##: man what has blockstream and their venture capitalists done for bitcoin either though\n60. [4:25 PM] ANON##: lightning network as you saw is the AOL model of federation\n61. [4:25 PM] ANON##: everyone in off chain exchanges. well not much different than things are now, but it entrenches it\n62. [4:26 PM] ANON##: so its more likely that we will live in walled gardens where in theory you can send bitcoin and sync to the blockchain, but in practice it is just another central payment system\n63. [4:27 PM] ANON##: in the end centralized development of decentralized networks is ineffective\n64. [4:28 PM] ANON##: it worked for linux with the dictator for life Linus\n65. [4:28 PM] ANON##: but here we got the bitcoin civil war with miners vs developers, and thus miners have to launch essentially coups to support the developers they choose\n66. [4:28 PM] ANON##: and all the while people are too busy trying to pump up coins and speculate up, building advanced trading bots instead of being incentivized to help build the blockchain better\n67. [4:29 PM] ANON##: we are in that stage where we got the internet but at 56k dial up speeds\n68. [4:30 PM] ANON##: finally almost all exchanges are dependent on Tether.to's USDT, which  they claim to exchange 1:1 for us dollars\n69. [4:30 PM] ANON##: this was a godsend when the Bitlicense was introduced requirng full identification for fiat exchanges, and when China banned fiat exchanging\n70. [4:31 PM] ANON##: this way exchanges like Binance don't have to ask you for any identification info, which is a boon to chinese investors essentially laundering their money to US dollars using USDT\n71. [4:31 PM] ANON##: obviously though the first problem is that, well who guarantees the value of USDT\n72. [4:31 PM] ANON##: if you sign up for tether.to you will realize it\n73. [4:31 PM] ANON##: you can't create an account\n74. [4:32 PM] ANON##: i have an account and I can't exchange unless i have a minimum of $50000 of capital\n75. [4:32 PM] ANON##: so where do they even get their us dollars\n76. [4:32 PM] ANON##: all the more problematic that we see in their account they are printing $20 million every day\n77. [4:33 PM] ANON##: they are essentially the central bank of cryptocurrency, since almost all the exchanges have given them the responsibilty of exchanging their fiat\n78. [4:34 PM] ANON##: https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL\n",

When you are sending a payment to someone you use the address that receiver tells you to use. You don't control if he is reusing them or not. \n\nNow, imagine you receive 10 payments in 10 different addresses you created. When you want to send some coin your wallet will create a transaction using one or more of your 10 addresses  (as input) and deposit the value on the receivers address (as output). \n\nAs you can see the output of one more transactions serves as input for a new transaction. \n\n",

As I said before, listening to Andreas Antonopoulos explaining Bitcoins potential is a good place to start.\n\nHe does address these things in the 3 minute long video I linked, and he also talks about the fact that algorithms can be simplified as to reduce the energy consumption needed to validate the transactions on the Blockchain. I have no source to backup my statement of the current banking system using much more energy than Bitcoin. However, in my opinion, we should we seriously considering this technology, which is still in it's very early stages, because of the many potentials it has to improve the global monetary system. ",

People are not willing to accept that ANYTHING that uses amount of energy just to exist is unlikely to survive.  The fact that some people care more about personal gain than the environment is disgusting, but it's the reason why we are in this mess to begin with. A very American mindset\n\nFor this reason I personally believe that any crypto based on proof of work will probably not be widely adopted long run. Proof of stake and other methods such as the tangle are my bet for the future.",

            "Text": "People went head first into the mania phase last week and spent $1,000s of dollars on bitcoin near the ATH and are now deep in the red down anywhere 20%-30% from their investment ($19k-$14.5k). Losing $1,000 overnight is not an easy feeling for most. And in an asset this volatile, there no telling how much more they might lose or if they\u2019ll ever get it back. So to say bitcoin will be $50,000 next year is pure speculation. Nobody knows. It could easily be back under $5,000 for all of next year and 2017 could be the \u201cyear of the bubble\u201d just like 2013 was. It\u2019s all up in the air. ",

I have a family member who works at NFA which is also based out of Chicago and they're very interested to see what happens with CBOE and CMA.
