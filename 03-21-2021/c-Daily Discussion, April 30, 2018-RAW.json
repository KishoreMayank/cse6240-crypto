I think we need to crack $12k before it will get really busy.\n\nI know from fx days there's only really 2 busy days a week. Let me lay it out for you.\n\nMonday : Everyone is pissed from Sunday BBQ, need coffee...\n\nTuesday: Everyone still got the Monday blues, trying but not too hard . Looking at the charts\n\nWednesday: Feeling better, put in some orders. See how it goes.\n\nThursday: Holy crap, haven't made any money this week. Buy some shit.\n\nFriday : Half day. Take the profit by lunch, hit the bar.\n\nSaturday: Ugh, Fridays sucks. Hair of the dog, 10 am beer.  BBQ !\n\nSunday: Hair of the dog, 10 am beer.

            "Text": "Dude, I'm sorry, but if you don't think a 16,000 coin dump will \"make much of a difference\" you don't understand the workings of this market. \nThose MTGox coins DO have the potential to move the market in a big way. Hopefully they get traded OTC or are drip-fed into the market, but regardless, small investors are still at the mercy of other large holders who are capable of crashing the market pretty hard. \nThose large balances are the elephant in the room. They are there for all to see but nobody really wants to acknowledge them. \nPosts that do acknowledge that we investors are at the mercy of some random BTC millionaire get downvoted because, well, let's just try and push that idea out of sight and out of mind (a human trait that seems magnified in this crypto world, along with a couple other characteristics we have).\nIn my opinion there are still a few shakeouts to come before this market settles to the point where we can use crypto as actual currency (no shit Sherlock) and I think a lot of investors will unfortunately get hurt in the process. The reason I think this is because I believe in the general idea that there is no free lunch. \nThis space seems overpopulated with people that haven't learnt that basic premise, but that's ok. I think that's mainly because crypto is populated by a relatively youthful majority and the youth can bounce back if they lose a chunk of dough. \nAnyway, I believe Bitcoin is here for the long term. I think it has a solid foundation and a resilience that other coins do not have. Be careful not to invest more than you can afford to lose and you can ride the market without worry as it plays out. There will be swings larger than today's 5% to come and it's not worth the stress to have too much invested on them. \nI think there's still time to gradually get into the market. \nDisclaimer: I suck at predicting which way this thing goes. \n",

            "Text": "Not the point. The total volume of coins traded in a day is meaningless when the average trade is as small as it is. \nA daily volume of 1 million coins is made up of 1,000,000's of trades each hour, half on the green side/half on the red side, with the average trade < 0.01 BTC. You better believe that selling chunks of volume into that market will move it pretty hard.\nI know someone who is scalping 1.80% per trade using \"just\" 30 Bitcoins. He's making multiple trades on each side per day. This on a small exchange with a daily volume of 400 or so BTC. He's taken his initial investment off the table and is making a tidy income for himself with a simple scalping bot. He would screw that market for himself and lose all profit in commission if he put in a market price sell of 30 BTC though. Instead he's able to bounce off the walls he sets up on each side. \n\n",
