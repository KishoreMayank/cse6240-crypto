At some point the 6 billion will move on with other types of currency because they can't buy one from the 20 million who will not sell them. Everyone is hodling so no one is using them to buy anything or pay anyone at their business.  Then, when people have moved on and no one will buy anything the 20 million have, they will start to panic and sell off but no one is buying because they've all moved on to the next thing. This will never happen with BTC, of course, but is a hypothetical based on the above scenario. If you can't have it, you move on. People still hold old stocks that have gone out of business because they can't sell them and they are worthless because we've \"moved on\" with other companies who are in business and turning profit but they still claim their stock is valuable ",
