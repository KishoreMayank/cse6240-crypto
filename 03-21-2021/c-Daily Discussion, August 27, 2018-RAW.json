This is really important because whenever the whales want to reck a shorter, they do so by first buying that shorter\u2019s massive BTCs and then pumping up the price at X price first to hold that shorter in regret for a few days. They love creating a mental test in hope that shorter will rebuy those same BTCs at a more expensive price encouraging them to believe that Bitcoin will go up in price. As soon as they save this mini-whale rebuying a similar order at higher price, they dump Bitcoin in classic bull trap fashion.  Likewise the adage \u201cdon\u2019t buy the dip\u201d...you shouldn\u2019t buy the rise either. But, in this instant if this rekt news is true, it\u2019s a very good time to buy the rise because the whales will want to reck this shorter. If anyone knows for a fact this tweet is true, please confirm. Thanks.",

I set up an LND node on a raspberry pi (c-lightning and eclair are a couple of the other popular full-node software).  It can handle sending, receiving, or routing other payments through it (you can collect a small fee for doing this).  If you just want to be able to purchase something from your smartphone, there are implementations which transmit only and are not so resource intensive.\n\n",
