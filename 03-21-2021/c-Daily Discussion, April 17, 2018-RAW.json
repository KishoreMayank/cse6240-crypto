As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400-$8,500.\n",

I had the idea of investing a really low amount (>30\u20ac) in a crypto currency and withdraw something like 5\u20ac/week, is this feasible? I have no interest in risking a lot of money for a chance at winning a lot or becoming rich, just a ~~low and steady~~ extra source of ~~capital~~ money.\n\nEdit: a friend of mine is really interested in the topic and thus I understand the basics of it, but he's obsessed with becoming rich (he also doesn't have financial problems like me) and I cba to ask him for advice lol.

Only downside he says is that can only trade when market is open but not a big deal if you in it for the long haul.\n\nIs he right? Is there something else he's missing?",

At some point the final capitulation occurs and after that the slow multi-year crawl.   \n\nYea,  history does repeat itself\n",

            "Text": "FWIW, the wealthiest investors will usually go on extension and will not pay their taxes until their last extension runs out, i.e., September 15 for business entities, and October 15 for individuals. There are many reasons for this: (1) Their returns are usually much more complicated and can't be worked out quickly; (2) They usually invest in LLCs and limited partnerships, which often have their own complex returns, and thus don't crank out their Form K-1s until late August or September, (3) They like to hold on to their unpaid tax moneys for liquidity, and (4) There is a theory that goes around to the effect that the IRS in any given tax year only has the manpower to audit so many returns (which is true) and thus (this is the theory part) by the time the IRS gets to the returns late in the year their allotment of audits for that tax year have already been used up or substantially diminished, lowering the audit rate further if not eliminating it outright. BTW, this is one of the reasons that U.S. investments markets get weak in September and October (when most of the largest drops historically occur) because entities and wealthy investors are having to liquidate some positions to generate the cash to pay any tax liability they didn't estimate and pre-pay. The upshot is that the April 15 (or 17) tax day is mostly for wage-earners who are not big investors, if at all.",

I worked (and so did my wife) hard as hell to get where I/we are today. My mom didn't help me, I signed up for the military to pay for my schooling. I literally signed my life away for a chance to go to college that wouldn't financially cripple my mother. Any person over 18 (and under in some cases) can do exactly what I did. No luck, just hard work. Some people aren't willing to do that. That guy, is one of those people. ",

If you want a pretty good paying job, get an LPN license, it's cake work (pass meds, run to a random code), but the hours can be long. But you can make 60k per year easy. Want to make more? Get your RN. Work in a hospital, get specialized. Want even more? Get your BSN, work in a hospital, and manage nurses or get into teaching (with your MSN). Want to double that? Get your nurse practitioners licence. Then you can do simple surgeries, open a practice, get into family medicine, be a PCP. The sky is the limit with that bad boy.",
