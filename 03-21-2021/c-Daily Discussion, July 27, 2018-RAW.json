There is no \"manipulation\" if you don't allow yourself to get manipulated.\n\nWhen you buy (or sell) you should have a decision matrix created in advance. A matrix that tells you \"If this happens, then I do that\" ; and then stick to your matrix. This prevents you from FOMOing or dumping simply due to emotion. \n\nThose trying to manipulate the market will end up losing enormously when the market moves against the direction they are trying to prod people in. If you have a decision matrix in advance, its much more difficult to manipulate you.\n\nIf you thought Bitcoin was a good buy at $20k then it should be an amazing buy at $7k ; otherwise you were either being manipulated then; or you're being manipulated now. The short term price should not change your long-term opinions on a revolutionary technology; if you are prone to such flippancy you should probably avoid trading or investing.\n",

In my opinion, the ETF decision released yesterday feels like a \"good cop\" / \"bad cop\" kind of situation. i.e. we're going to protect investors. But then, the commissioner disagrees with the decision. Effectively teeing up approval for the CBOE ETF.  You know, because it will only be allowed for \"accredited investors\".\n\nI mean, it was amazing how fast the response was posted after the news was dropped. I'm sure they knew of the decision for a while. But how long? And, doesn't that seem like a conflict to sit on a decision for a while? \n\nPersonally, I don't care about the ETF decision. However, part of me wants to see the Winklevii get rewarded for championing some of the space.\n\n*NOTE: Added second paragraph on edit.\n\n\n\n",

They are having trouble differentiating between Shit-coin ICOs and a legitimate Crypto company/product like a Wallet or price tracking app. This hurts products that actually provide utility and would make cryptos more attractive to use and invest in. So until they figure this out we wont be seeing any crypto related ads from them. This, along with Facebook slowly ( and I mean very slowly) increasing the number of new crypto related ads means that the general population has very limited exposure to things related to crypto. I think once these major ad providers start regularly displaying crypto ads we will see a major jump in the popularity of crypto again! ",

Notably, the short-duration price chart had warned of a dip below $8,000 yesterday.\n\nAt press time, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $7,965 on Bitfinex, having clocked a three-day low of $7,848 earlier today.\n\nIt is worth noting that BTC is still up 40 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755, despite the pullback from the two-month highs above $8,500. Thus, it is safe to say the bull market is intact.\n\nView\n\nThe short-term outlook remains bullish, despite the overnight correction in BTC prices.\n\nThe 200-day moving average hurdle of $8,557 could be put to test over the weekend if prices find acceptance above $8,000 in the next 24 hours.\n\nOn the downside, only a daily close below the rising 10-day MA of $7,718 would abort the short-term bullish view.",

I've almost lost hope a couple times. I've sold some over time and I've made plenty of money but I've also regretted not holding more.\n\nI've been down in the dumps about Bitcoin before, but let me tell you, if it didn't fail in 2016 it's certainly not failing now. There were much worse days than these. We're up a LOT in the last 24 months.\n\nTrust me, don't go 100% fiat, just keep a little skin in the game, because you never know.

Other than that, the rest of what you said sounds completely irrational and lacks all reflection of any understanding of how technology actually evolves. \n\nThe first ten years? That was establishing a basic level of stability in the sense that the network is not going down and has not been hacked. That period is CRUCIAL for any additional thought to be given to it regarding upgrades and improvements. It basically provides the confidence needed to make the additional effort worthwhile. NO other crypto can even come close to having this period of stressed testing. Plus a currency blockchain does NOT need the fancy bells and whistles many of the others are outlining in whitepapers, for projects not even started yet!\n\nThe internet started in the 60's with a small niche group of government based users, and over the next several decades improvement were added as it became evident that it was a useful tech. They added layers, packet switching, etc etc. Then in the 90's it started in homes, and much later could accommodate high bandwidth video and audio transfers....and we're still adding and improving.\n\nSo before you say Bitcoin had 9 years to attract retailers, try and understand that Bitcoin has not even begun to attract retailers...but it will. It almost definitely will. It needs to become much more user friendly, it needs to be gradually adopted, and it needs to come out of the shadows as improvements, layers and investment on-boarding invites more and more to the space. It won't need the timeline the internet needed, because well ...the internet is the foundation of Bitcoin's network, so the global connection is there. But it does need more time than this. Bitcoin is about as progressed as it should be at this point in time. When it actually hits though, I mean really sticks? You won't need anyone to tell you about it, put it that way.  \n ",

            "Text": "Last upward resistance was from the 17th to 22nd at 7300. Seeing as RSI14 struck 77 as of the 24th we are going to see downward trends until RSI14 goes to 30 (which is basically what this market likes to do since people love huge overbuying and overselling swings on this market). As a result of this downward trend we will see downward resistance at 7300 again. If that resistance breaks we will shoot to the last highest  horizontal movement which is roughly 6500-6700 which occurred during the 2nd to the 10th. If that resistance breaks before RSI14 hits 30 then we will most likely see a drop to the next line of resistance which is 6200-6300 which occurred between the 10th and 16th. But by that point we will most likely be in a heavily oversold market and people will begin selling at higher prices again. Also this won't be overnight but will most likely take a week or two to test 7300.",

They're doing this so that when the contract ends and they have to \"sell\" bitcoin at the price they agreed to, say $6000, they won't lose nearly as much money as they would if it had breached 9k, 10k etc. Sooo when the contracts end there will be less pressure on said whales to keep the price down and thus less resistance to the upward momentum.

That took a long time regardless, because no mainstream public adoption is possible without ease of use. Perhaps you think Bitcoin is easy to use, but for the general public  it is not. For example, Wallet address translation will enable a transparent solution to start. I worked on early networks and many of my peers, including a few that have been mining and trading Bitcoin for years, see unbelieveable similarities here. But hey, it's ok to disagree. You'll hopefully retain your health and easily live long enough to see it yourself. My only input is if you want to own Bitcoin, it will cost you a hell of a lot more then. Let's watch it unfold and discuss it in 5 years.\nBy the way, if you really believe Bitcoin has been around since the 90's, somebody lied to you.",
