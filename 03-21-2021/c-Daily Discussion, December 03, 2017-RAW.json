Been watching and watching and I felt like this might be the lowest we see it again, (as a possibility) and just bought 2,000 more in USD when it went down at like 11,035. We'll see what happens now. If it took a huge plummet I might have a bad taste in my mouth but it wouldn't really bother me. I'll probably just buy more at that point anyways. BTC is going to end up at the very least 40-60k per BTC but probably much higher. I'll be better off in the end either way.",

            "Text": "I want to share my story over how I became a Master crypto trader I first heard about Bitcoin a couple years ago from a twitter account called Trutherbot. This twitter account played a big role in waking me to the truths of the federal reserve and the worldwide central banking scam. Nevertheless everytime he would post something about bitcoin I was to lazy to actually watch a 10 minute video on what it was. Fast forward to summer 2017 Im working and going to school at the same time hating both at the same time. While I learned some valuable lessons and hd great teachers in college I saw Most universities as outdated institutions more focused on making money and having a succesful football team that actually keeping up to date with the age of information where most careers will have to be relearned by the time you get that paper. To top it all off I would have to go into debt to pay a 4 year university tuition.  My job on the other hand was HUGE on \"SELL THIS SELL THAT SELL EVERYTHING\" It always made me feel like a total cuck seeing poor ladies with their fast food uniform on count out cash to try and pay their bills and it be my job to try to sell them on something I knew they couldn't afford. Point being I felt like a total shill working there and I wanted out. By habit I fall sleep watching a documentary about anything I find on youtube.  I watched a youtuber who  mentioned Bitcoin which was what eventually made me say \" What the hell is this bitcoin thing\" and decided to do some research. It was love at first sight. I saw Bitcoin as a sword forged from liberty itself to cut off the tentacles of historical bank oppression and create a financial revolution #DecentralizeEverything. I was so ecstatic; I felt like I had discovered a digital California gold rush besides the technological and financial revolution I was witnessing. I became huge on Bitcoin, almost all my twitter and facebook posts were about cryptocurrency and I kept telling everyone how this was the future. In those summer months I would get out what I could of my paycheck and put it into bitcoin. As the boom continued I continued to HODL and make more money. Then it hit me. \"people who dedicate their life to trading stocks or forex it isnt luck its a strategy, and any strategy can be learned and applied. As I hodled I called my family back in Mexico and told them all about it and my mom sent me 1k to invest it for her. The more I grew in knowledge the more comfortable I felt trading. Over time due to my posts on social media more and more people kept messaging me asking me about bitcoin and how they could invest. This made me decide to start a hedge fund and run it month by month. This was it. My exit from being a tax slave to the dollar fictional system. I quit my job, dropped out of school sold my car and moved back to Mexico with my fam so I could focus full time to trading with maximum efficiency. Fast forward to November 2017. I have 12.5 k invested and my sister turns 15, Her Dad sends her 6k as a birthday present and my mom gives me 4k to invest it for her. Total 16.5 k for the month. One night, I see BCH is pumping like hell. Sticking to trader discipline I tell myself theres no way IM buying on such a high, It goes from 300 to 400 to 500 to 600 to 1lk bam bam bam. This at the same time BTC is going down. I scamble to social media and see everyone talking about \"The Cashening\". I told myself I wouldent switch unless it went over 2.5k. Within 15 minutes I saw my fund drop 50% in price and i dumped. Now sitting with 50% of what I had I knew I had to make a powerplay to end the month positive. I scoured altcoins for that answer and found XLM. I even posted an analyses on my tradingview. telling everyone to buy at 491 and predicted a 57-120% increase . 4 hours before The pump I set a stop loss on XLM and go to sleep just in case. I wake up to find myself stop lossed with no XLM and it being around 1k sats. again , devastation. I wasent about to end the month negative and dissapoint all my Friends and family. I learned how to margin trade. I made an account on Bitmex and transfered my remaining funds in there. Fast forward to today. I see BTC forming a pennant after breaking resistance and decide to all in 25x leverage. Gone, everything is gone. I apologize for the rushed ending but im still in shock. Im sorry for the clickbait title but I want this story to serve as an example to anyone who wants to become a \"trader\"  in crypto. My advice is never go all in and just hodl; dont trade. or you could end up like me. A fool who let greed blind him. I dont want anyone else to experience the stress and anguish I felt and still feel. This all happened not more than 2 hours ago. Please be careful.",

Thing is, it's only ~.4 mBTC in my electrum wallet that I want to send back to GDAX or coinbase right now, and the fees are huge relative to the amount I'm sending. Is there a way around this?",

I just put $10 USD into Coinbase, got my bitcoins and transferred them to my software wallet(Bitcoin Core). I did this as a proof of concept for myself and now I have about .0004 BTC in my wallet.  \n\nI have next step questions as follows:  \n  \n1) Since each address has it's own PK. I need to keep track of each PK for each address(each containing a chuck of BTC?)?  \n  \n2) If yes to 1: Should I move all received BTC to a new single(or maybe several) address(s) and keep track of the single PK? EX: A main storage address that is new every time I add a significant sum?  \n  \n3) When moving bitcoin to cold storage. How should I remove it from the computer that received it(simply delete \"wallet.dat\")?  \n    a. Is simply taking my encrypted wallet and moving it to several USBs is the act of \"cold storage\"?  \n    b. Is simply writing down my PK on paper is the act of \"Cold Storage\"?  \n\nSorry if these answers could have been found elsewhere. I would really just like to demystify some of the seemingly simple stuff for myself.  \n   \nThank you in advance, this sub has already been so helpful to me.",

Contracts with minors are not always enforcible, which is part of why you can't do many financial things like take a car loan by yourself. Even your bank account has to be consigned, I believe.  Get a parent/guardian to help.  The worst case is that you buy a coin, the price goes way up, and they decide not to honor your purchases.  You would have to fight if that happened and might lose.  This is similar to minors playing slot machines.  There are stories of 17 year olds hitting the jackpot, but the casino didn't have to pay them (in fact was legally required not to pay them) since it was not legal for them to gamble.",

I think GDAX can be trusted enough to carry out the trade, but there's no way I'm storing my BTC there.\n\nRegarding security measures I think properly setting up a cold storage wallet is the most important. I ordered a Trezor hardware wallet, it hasn't arrived yet so for now I'm using Electrum (software wallet). There's the option of using an air-gapped computer (never been connected to the internet), but that can be impractical for most people I think. The last option is a single-use paper wallet, but that takes a lot of precaution and ideally an air-gapped computer and printer to create in a safe manner.\n\nThe easiest and safest option is a Trezor hardware wallet. I haven't used any other exchanges yet, only GDAX so maybe others have some better insights. Just don't use Coinbase unless you like paying fees, you can get BTC on GDAX with zero fees to buy and zero fees to get it sent to your wallet.",

            "Text": "Regarding the transaction fees and processing time, these are challenges that are actively being worked on. The Lightning Network is a possible solution, and SegWit is one that has been developed, but not universally adopted.\n\nAs for power consumption, the idea is that technology will improve to keep up. We saw the absorption of the GTX 1070 and 1080 cards being used by miners, and shortly after the ASICs took over making the GPU mining obsolete for Bitcoin, but still doable for altcoins.\n\nWhat Bitcoin, and potentially any other successful crypto, demands is that industry keep up with it. It's a motivator and perhaps will have a side-effect of fueling the need for solar and wind power as well as advancing technology.\n\nIt's like Bitcoin is **the** proof-positive test run that never got shutdown. It also is the best testing ground for real-world high demand blockchain usage. Regardless of the debate whether it is or will be ever a currency, or whether it is a huge bubble, it is possibly the most important live experiment we have going in the financial world today.\n\nThat being said, many see the importance of what it is beyond the market value, many bank on it being a paradigm shift in global economy. It's still early adoption, and the growing pains are more than present, but everyday, more smartypants people are working on solving the problems.\n\nNow, the surface benefit is that we stand to make profit off this experiment in that the value has had a trend to increase overall in time. Economists are divided, but I can't help but to think that it truly will soar in 2018, so I'm going in heavy (I have little to lose if it bottoms out, I'm very resilient to loss).\n\nThere is so much positive about Bitcoin happening right now. I knew better to get in years ago, and have been kicking myself for a good solid month because it took me this long to get in. I tried before, but it was too confusing for me at the time I looked at it 7 years ago.",

The price of bitcoins is still rooted in the faith of a species known to change its minds.\n\nIf people collectively think that bitcoin is a great thing for the future then the price will continue surging, but if some flaw causes people to lose interest then the bubble will pop.\n\nI can't answer such a binary question, but I think bitcoin is a great idea and I hope others see what I see.",

That's more tthan okay, and I've got plenty of respect for anyone's decisions. If I lose it all, honestly not concerned. That's just over half a week's paycheck for me I've invested in total now.

            "Text": "> Coinbase owns GDAX.com. Deposit money into your Coinbase USD wallet and transfer that money over to GDAX and buy on there. Fees are a lot less or free (depending on how you buy). You can transfer coins, money, etc back to Coinbase. Your Coinbase username and password works on GDAX. \n\nIm trying to get access to GDAX but they tell me I need another form of identification besides the one I already done when signing up to coinbase, is this normal?",

I understand the fundamental difference that the dotcom bubble was about stocks, but I don't think bitcoin is immune to a similar effect.\n\nWhat's worth noting is that the internet is worth a lot more than it was at the peak of that bubble. The expectations for the internet was higher than what the people could make of the technology in a short enough time. I similarly think the bitcoin price and expectations is getting ahead of what will evolve out of the technology in the time people expect.\n\nThere's several things that needs to improved about bitcoin and in time that will happen. But if that's not delivered within the expected timeframe, if the development is not fast enough then the price will adjust to match what it currently delivers. Now the price is adjusting towards what people believe it will deliver in the future, people might lose faith of it doesn't come fast enough.\n\nI do fundamentally agree with your argument though, but it doesn't guarantee this isn't a bubble. A bubble doesn't have to mean the end of something, it may be something that happens along the way.",

            "Text": "GDAX has a 0.25% fee on takers and 0% on makers. What that means if that if you are putting a new order on the order book, you don't pay anything, but if you are matching with an existing order, you pay the fee. \n\nFor example, if you are buying at 5000 and nobody is selling at that price (your buy limit order has to be below the mid market price), your order will sit on the book until some \"taker\" wants to sell for your price. If nobody wants to sell for 5000, then somebody else might buy at 5000.01 (the current price) this will move the price up, and it might keep going up, so your limit order might never be filled.\n\nBasically market orders execute immediately at the current price (they will be matched with any seller or buyer), while limit orders are put on the order book until someone either does a market order, or \"gives in\" and puts a limit order in for your price. By default you can't put a limit order in as a maker (This is called \"post only\") anyways though.\n\nSo to buy or sell with no fee, the easiest way is to place a limit order for the best bid or ask price. (e.g. if the highest buy price is 5000, put a limit for 5000). Your order might take a minute or so for someone to sell for it (if the price is going down), or the price might move up, in which case you need to cancel your order and retry it (e.g. if the mid market price is 5002.495, try to buy at 5002.49), unless you think that it might come back down. Limit orders can be particularly hard to do when the price is moving quickly. If the price is moving up, by the time you put in an order it may have moved up more, so your buy won't be triggered, the only way to follow the price quickly is with automated trading bots.\n\n",

It is only important servicing your requirement.  If you have a node, you can use bitcoin, regardless of whether you are a listening node.\n\n\nIt really sounds like you want to do this the right way.  I would suggest running a pruned node without listening.  You can do almost anything if you do this.  After you sync, you might even want to run it over TOR.",

Rock solid security, and the port not being open shouldn't really matter if you're primarily concerned with your own coins/funds.\n\n>If I send Bitcoin to another address from MultiBit - which doesn't understand SegWit - will the funds be usable in a SegWit-capable wallet, or would I have to regain control of my wallet from a SegWit-capable wallet before sending the funds?\n\nI don't believe there are any wallets which are SegWit-capable that do *not* simultaneously support legacy transaction/address formats. That is to say, you don't have to worry about it before sending, the funds will be usable either way.",

            "Text": "> can i generate an arbitrary key with geli or something like that?\n\nI don't know about geli specifically, but I know that I've used Bit in Python to easily generate private keys and the public keys associated with them. Bit also lets you check balances, create and broadcast transactions, etc. A very simple open-source wallet could easily be created in it to only manage a single address.\n\n> Cant you just lose the seed as easily as you lose the private key? wtf it makes no sense lol. who remembers a sequence of 20 words? \n\nThe difference is that the seed generally allows you to store just that one string and it holds all of the info for the private keys for you. If you only want to keep track of a single address, you don't need the seed at all. You just need the private key to the address you want to hold onto.\n\n20 words are easier to remember than a random string of digits, and much harder for a brute-force system to break. That's why seeds exist.",

When you are investing in something, you are literally betting that the price will go up, as soon as you buy it. If it goes down instead, you were wrong. And you should leave the investment and walk away because your initial idea and the whole reason you entered your position is incorrect. Staying in an investment that goes against you is wishful thinking and holding on for dear life because you don't want to be wrong. Meanwhile, you could have taken a small loss and put that money into something that's actually working for you. \n\nTo clarify with your Amazon example, if I got in at 100, I would have sold no lower than 90 when it started to drop. Then while everyone was watching it crash to 10 and slowly rise back up to 100, I could be having that  $90 make some money in a better company. You can always get back in  ",

Do you think the 1%, the people who have power and billions in USD's, want that? I highly doubt it will be banned, but there is motive to do so!

That's just way too far for a majority of the population. It's far more likely that the US treasury tries to move some of their assets over to bitcoin early enough for it to be a strong move for them. \n\nActually that's being talked about and considered at this very moment.",
