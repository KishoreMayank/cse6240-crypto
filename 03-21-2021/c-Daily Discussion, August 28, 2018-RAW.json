            "Text": "To anyone out there that has still not caught on:\n\nXapo, in Hong Kong, is a Bitcoin vault company already storing over $10 billion in Bitcoin on behalf of institutions. The BoA have a crypto vault project underway to allow enterprises to safely store large amounts of digital assets providing a platform for large institutions to allocate large sums of money into the crypto sector.\n\nIn November, The Bakkt digital asset platform will provide a global network using Microsoft cloud-based services for physically-settled Bitcoin Futures contracts. This is a joint venture created by Microsoft, Starbucks, and the New York Stock Exchange... pretty serious players if you ask anyone with a clue.\n\nThe number of coders contributing to Bitcoin open source have more than tripled, apps and user friendly tech to onboard new users/investors are growing rapidly.\n\nMultiple ETFs are being proposed and revised on an ongoing basis, and regulations are forming. Mainstream media are all but promoting crypto because it brings strong viewership and public awareness which is increasing by the day.\n\nOn top of all that, physical over-the-counter infrastructure is growing out of control and this is just the start.\n\nNow if this happened in a small time frame, can you even begin to imagine where this will be in a few more years?   Average Joe's not involved in this space will clue in once Bitcoin is a mainstream investment and accepted as an alternative currency...just status quo, and they will think all this happened overnight, like the tap feature on a credit card. This is EXACTLY how things evolve. THINK PEOPLE. Don't just keep regurgitating the same ol shit because you see shifts in the coin price. Look at the big picture and smarten the f up.",

            "Text": "Hey guys! I plan on setting up a lightning node on an RPi 3 soon, like within the next week or two. Is there any one place that's a good resource for how to go about doing that/ FAQs about the lightning network in general? \n\nI have a good base understanding of it, but I want to dig into the nitty gritty. I took a look over at /r/lightningnetwork but their sidebar is pretty sparse.\n\nI'd appreciate any pointers, Thanks!\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\n I found [This](https://dev.lightning.community/resources/index.html) and it looks like a pretty decent jumping off point, at least for learning more about the LN itself.\n\n",

In fact the 2013 run-up was completely manipulated by a couple of bots.\n\nPersonally I think we're in a little bit of no-man's-land when trying to determine the bottom or how the next Bull Run will begin. We have had a fundamental level change with institutional money and with people believing in Bitcoin this time around. In 2014 and 2015 70% of the market was Mount gox. When that blows up and people lose everything. You're just never going to get that level of pessimism again today without a couple of things happening. One of them would be if the worst case scenario of tether comes to happen. The other one would be if a major exchange went down and was hacked or the owners ran off with all the money or something like that",

There was a much greater percentage increase in 2013 and not only that the market started at $20 in January.

He said Bitcoin is completely Anonymous and alluded to it being used by criminals and the government will never allow that. That's what people were saying 5 years ago but as we now know the government can very easily track Bitcoin and it's not anonymous. If it was actually a threat it would have been shut down way before it got to a 100 billion plus dollar market cap. If you watch a lot of TV interviews they always try and get somebody who has a negative view point and a positive view point to make a show. If they were able to get Obama and Trump in the same room believe you me they would love to make a TV show about that. Having these two conflicting points of view gets ratings and it's how they make TV",
