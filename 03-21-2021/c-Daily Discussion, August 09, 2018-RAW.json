She admits she is a fickle gal, but asks everyone to be patient with her and ... just ... believe!  \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis guy understood:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n\nIf you are worried or scared that bitcoin will fail you are wrong and in bitcoin for the wrong reason.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nu/apollojmr - 4 years ago\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is not a get rich quick scheme. It has indeed made many millionaires but mostly by accident. The people that have made a lot of money off of bitcoin have done so because they kept the faith and not invested in bitcoin to get rich but rather invested because they truly believe in the system and what it stands for. Bitcoin is not an investment, stock or a way to get rich. Bitcoin is a huge technological breakthrough that is a solution to a lot of problems in the tech world and it makes a lot of things easier. I am a firm believer that if you stop worrying about the price and start worrying about how to incorporate it within the already defunct system, that you will be lucky along the way and witness a spike that will allow you to cash in on your loyalty and patience. I can remember a day when I thought spending $20 a coin was a huge risk. I wish I would have known then what I know now. But then that is the way things work that we truly believe in. I am dealing with a friend that invested $20k back when they were at the $266 spike and then they dropped he was mad. However when they went up to $1200 he was happy. Now even though he bought in at $266 he feels like hes lost lately with the downslide. Just like before I told him to have patience and believe and it will be alright. Just as I am telling you all the same. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. Stay tuned.\n\n\u2014-\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22se86/if_you_are_worried_or_scared_that_bitcoin_will/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd then a Doubting Thomas:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n\nScared newby here. Doesn't know if I should sell or not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nu/marisam7 - 2 years ago\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know people are saying to not panic and that the price will come back but I don't have the patience to wait 4 years for it to come back to 750$\n\nI was reading a coinbase article from 2014 saying that all the experts say in two years bitcoin will be worth 10 k per coin. Now I see those people are wrong in the past and I just want to know if they are wrong now.\n\nIn short is bitcoin still going to reach a grand by the end of the year?\n\n\u2014-\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4p4igm/scared_newby_here_doesnt_know_if_i_should_sell_or/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy contrast, a brave soul:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2014-\n\nI'm still not scared\n\n&nbsp;\n\nu/scurvyscallywag - 2 years ago\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I was here to laugh after finding out why Bitcoin's price fell. Bratty developer can't handle reality. I found this old post I made.\n\n/r/Bitcoin/comments/2gwpxs/im_not_scared/\n\nI'm not going to go into my returns but I continued making larger purchases into the price decline as low as $220 per Bitcoin. These purchases were all unloaded during the recent spike to $500.\n\nBuy when others are fearful and sell when others are optimistic. Just like last time, I'm here to let you know these are good prices and I'm not scared.\n\nLast time I was here I was posting about buying 15 Bitcoin when most people here were panicing and saying \"are you buying the dip?!?\" trying to call everyone out as if no one is actually buying Bitcoin.\n\nIf you bought in when I made that post Bitcoin was at $400, Sept 18, 2014. A year and 1 month later Bitcoin hit $500, a return of 20% annualized, and that doesn't include buying all the way down as low as $167 where you could have gotten 300% returns.\n\nSo, I'll be buying again as soon as I can (no liquidity atm) and in another year or so I'll come back and make another post showing how $370 was a great time to buy in again.\n\nDon't say people don't tell you how to make money. ;) I understand this volatility scares the shit out of people though.\n\n\u2014-\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/416y3e/im_still_not_scared/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon\u2019t forget to read the replies to each of these. There is some gold in there. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, hang in there HODLers!  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n[- Hopium Time Archives - ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/)",

And that makes sense. The vast majority of the public still has no idea what \u2018digital assets\u2019 are or what it means. So when you do an approval like this, and the successive approvals that will follow in this asset class \u2013 think of the 3-5 year return number that will be associated with this market? And maybe that is the key to the Van Eck SolidX approval? It is set up as an accredited investor vehicle. That singular element is probably what gives so many of us a firm belief in its approval. And it is a stroke of genius by the Van Eck SolidX group.\u201d\n\n\n\nhttps://theicojournal.com/cboe-responds-after-delay-is-announced-sources-confirm-continued-bitcoin-etf-confidence/",

If anything, USA damaged it. We need a country to 100% take in crypto and start the revolution. Working in USA you can tell it\u2019s just a business with indoctrination for military. Most get in, make money and get out. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal with superpowers but Canadians dont do that. We\u2019ll find a friendly country soon but it\u2019s not the USA. I did multiple internships for USA Congress. They know Ver scammed thief older citizens and I believe now that they won\u2019t seek justice against him cause it\u2019s too difficult dealing with Japan and Japan is proud to have a USA citizen who renounced his citizenship and said he hates America and they deserve to be scammed. \nAmerica looked weak in this new battle and I read the letters to senators about losing money trying to buy a bitcoin for their grandchildren but Ver scammed them.  Bait and switched to Bcash. It was sad. I know my government would defend us but USA has so much going on they just wait for it to pass. Those old people lost thousands to Ver. ",

Having some Bitcoins grants you access to the blockchain, to transact with someone or to use the chain in any other way you want (digital contracts for example). The value of a Bitcoin more or less reflects the level of safety. The higher the safety and trustlessness of the chain, the higher the entry point for newcomers.  \nPersonally I like it because I'm tired of middlemen and their parasitic behavior when it comes to handle transactions.\nNo baseball card will ever do that.",

The price of BTC does not represent the value of the underlying technology.  \n\nWhen you buy a share of Apple, that's an investment that will appreciate in value when Apple is more successful.  When you buy an iPhone, you are just a customer.  \n\nBTC is the iPhone and the beauty of BTC is that the underlying tech is actually mostly open sourced.  I.e. you can't \"invest in the tech\".",

Also, if you can do that, please let me know in advance.  \n  \nGenerally in markets, the big dogs or those with insider knowledge stand to benefit the most from timing trades like this.  It only takes one whale who can afford a little better research/analysis, or who can move the whole market to wipe out a whole bunch of smaller traders trying to do the same.  Most who try to time the markets do worse than just dollar cost averaging or letting it ride.  \n  \nTo answer your last question, from my perspective the market looks about three times as good for a buyer now than it did in November/December.  Better news, better tech advancements, cheaper price.  Sure, it may drop lower yet, but the downside is a lot smaller now than it was at $19K.\n  \nGood luck to you.",

You can't, right?\n\nNo, but if its price is being artificially held low, then its actual value is certainly higher than it is now!\n\nIt is a new form of currency.  Nobody knows.  What I do know is that BTC is by far the leading and most trusted form of cryptocurrency; that it has a limited supply, and that is can't be uninvented.\n\nGold, BTW, is stuck at around 11-1200 USD and has been for ages - nobody understands why that is either!  All the economics suggest its price should be rising, but it isn't.  That is good for Bitcoin.  It could be the new gold - as well as a great form of instant and trusted payment with lightning network (RogerCoin's horrible 0-conf workaround is a non starter.  And that coin is likely to fork and split within the next few months because they know it.)\n\nSo it's reasonable to assume that BTC's price could go very high indeed - that's why I hold it.\n\n*Edit: added comments about gold's strange price stagnation.*",

Maybe it's just because people don't see that much of value in it any longer? \n\nFiat is guaranteed by the central banks and governments. Who is the guarantor of Bitcoin?  Only the people using it/hodling/trading. If they lose interest, then the price will go down as well. As everyone here, I'm looking forward to more adoption then.\n\nAlthough, as Kiyosaki have said, the economic system as we know it today could crash and who knows, maybe Bitcoin could be some type of store of value then.",

Then you can begin to see at least better similarities and improve your analogies.\n\nIn this respect USD is a currency \"owned\" by the Central Bank of the US. And Bitcoin is a currency \"owned\" by nodes and miners (at least the core network that facilitates Bitcoin is \"owned\" by the users of the peer-to-peer network and thus decentralized).\n\nWith this now in mind you should begin to look at currency exchanges and how people trade in those markets as well as begin to try and understand what effects occur in a market when \"everyone\" can technically be a producer and consumer of a global currency (something that hasn't really ever happened before in history unless you want to try and build some barter system analogy - which is probably an easier analogy for why BTC is so volatile and why many people can't sit on a simple price range for more than a week at a time). Sprinkle on the fact that it's a deflationary currency, market manipulation, FOMO, FUD etc etc. and you got yourself a much harder item to judge and analyze than just comparing it as equals to a stock or an iPhone.",

            "Text": "\u201cTo push the price to $10k per BTC it only takes a purchase of 4k bitcoin on coinbase pro.\u201d What does that mean? Are you stating that we are $4K away from Bitcoin being $10K which is obvious to anybody who knows elementary school math. Reading your statement, it sounds like you\u2019re saying that we need 4,000 BTCs purchased in order to reach the $10K Bitcoin price. 4K BTC is currently worth roughly $26 million dollars. A purchase of this magnitude...basically if somebody purchased $26 million of BTC, it would only raise BTC\u2019s price about $1.50 and definitely NOT $4,000. So, I have no idea what the hell you\u2019re trying to say because your statement is poorly worded. It takes about $60 billion worth of BTC or a purchase of nearly 10 million BTC to raise BTC\u2019s price to $10,000. Also the Tether time bomb is not necessarily the start of the bull run, more likely the start of a bear crash. You seem intelligent but you\u2019re statements are just so incorrect.",

            "Text": "A bitcoin is a promise of value backed by an authority (the authority is the blockchain and the peers who use the network). The trade of dollars to yen is exactly equivalent to trading dollars to bitcoin. Being that we are trading a currency for a currency they should act very similar to the foreign exchange market.\n\nMy Canadian dollars are valued at .77 dollars to United States Dollars. That valuation in this comparison is not \"backed\" by authority it is set by supply and demand for that currency. That valuation is set by traders purchasing CAD on the foreign exchange and these traders are only willing to buy Canadian dollars at a lower valuable than USD. This is equivalent to BTC being valued at $6000 USD but is far more volatile since the market has less barriers to entry than the forex.\n\nI am also not saying it does act like fiat. I think because many people don't see Bitcoin as an actual currency the market doesn't actually trade it like fiat. But fundamentally it should act like a currency and thus in the long run the market should result in similarities to currency exchange markets not stock markets.",

            "Text": "10 Million Bitcoin is 58% of the current Bitcoin supply? I'm not even sure if that much is on exchanges.\n\nI think you've made the mistake of looking at market cap as total money spent on bitcoin. Market cap is just the last sale price * supply. Liquidity is the important factor here. If you look at the depth chart on an exchange, it will tell you how much it would cost and at what price you could buy 4k BTC at. My numbers were taken from Coinbase Pro at the time of writing. I'm happy to explain further if you would like as I think you've made a few misunderstandings. \n\nTether is $2.4 billion stored in Crypto but not contributing to the price of bitcoin. Of all of the money from Tether went into Bitcoin at once, it would increase the BTC market cap much higher than $2.4 billion due to liquidity and slippage.\n\nedit - I just checked on Coinbase Pro. To purchase 4k Bitcoin using a market order would cost $33 Million and would push the price up to 10k per BTC.",
