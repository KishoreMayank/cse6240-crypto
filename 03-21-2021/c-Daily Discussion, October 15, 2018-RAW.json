Which has continued to double roughly every 2 months through the entire year despite a price decrease....That's a lot of new investment, heck the network was  already incredibly powerful and battle tested a year ago!!...In fact Bitcoins hashpower is nearly 7 times as power as it was last October, and is still increasing every 2 weeks by roughly 25% of what  the entire network had in total last October...Pretty wild.\n\nHere's a link to see the hashpower chart https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty\n",

Couldn't it be like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitcoin was has been on the verge of a breakout from the descending triangle pattern that has formed since the start of 2018. The past month traders have been watching the price closely to see if the breakout would be up or down. As the price started breaking out today, a lot of traders wanted to enter BTC again. Since most traders use USDT as a stable store of value when they are not invested, USDT got sold in exchange for BTC. Because more traders use USDT, the price of bitcoin against usdt went up faster. As people saw USDT tank in value because of traders buying BTC,  some people got scared and also converted their USDT to BTC, which increased this dynamic.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Tether\u2019s currency is as precarious and risky as Venezuelan fiat currency. This current fiasco is related to the significantly noticeable price discrepancy of Bitcoin among various exchanges. Why is this important? Obviously, we know Tether is a scam that is not sustainable similar to Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi. Tether could go 20 more years before it falls but it will collapse unlike Bitcoin which will exist throughout our lifetime. I predict Tether will collapse within this next decade if not next year or so. The Tether collapse is a fundamentally important step in the evolution and maturity of Bitcoin. When a particular coin is only created as a temporary fix to Bitfinex Exchange being hacked, you know that\u2019s not a good sign. Tether was created as an IOU but has evolved into the fake pumping of Bitcoin. Sure, some people use it as a tax haven but it\u2019s true intent was never legitimate or honest. Nothing has really happened in the Bitcoin world the past 12 hours. It\u2019s as stale as it has ever been. But, the Tether fiasco on Bitfinex has led to the pumping of Bitcoin on their exchange resulting in a $7,000 price totally deviating from other exchanges. Don\u2019t be misled and think that Crypto has experienced a gain recently. It has not. This is the calm before the storm.",

I think Bitcoin will surpass Dow Jones one day but it will not be anytime soon and certainly not until the next bull run. I predict the Dow Jones will face a major correction followed by a panic dump resulting in a $15K price. Then, there will be little more dumps resulting in a bottom of $12K. I see Bitcoin teaching it\u2019s bottom in the first quarter of 2019 to which all the Bitcoin pessimists will call it the end of Bitcoin. But, it will recover. Right now, having money in fiat currency seems like the best option.",

If that's the case, and you're capable of ignoring the day to day change in price, then invest what you feel you can afford to risk and don't think short term.

Ingredients include MSM hype, Infrastructure, partnerships, On-boarding tech, increase in user friendly interfaces, FOMO, ADOPTION, and much more. If you only think price follows interest or interest follows price you are wrong because they follow each other. Period. By the way .. who in the hell would think that today's little blip in the price would lead to 20K? Even if you only jumped in this game a few years ago, that's long enough to see it takes a lot more than a day of volatility to lead a bull run lol.",

If the market were convinced Bitfinex implodes tomorrow and tether is about to die, wouldn't everybody run for the exit ASAP?\n\nHere is my ad-hoc explanation how it worked?\n\n* market is scared about the USDT situation already, USDT price hits ~0.93\n* there is low liquidity on Kraken's USDTUSD order book\n* a bunch of whales do:\n* buying BTC @ Bitfinex\n* selling USDT @ Kraken\n* public thinks: \"OMG, Tether crashes!\"\n* people panic sell on Kraken\n* people FOMO buy on Bitfinex\n\nWhy manipulation?\nKraken USDT price fell to 0.85 on Kraken and now returned to its previous 0.93 level (While BTC on all exchanges is still higher).\n\nSo while everybody is talking about tether, BTC price moved up.",

The price start going up with a few catalysts last year... different experts claim different cataylsts including Futures, Tether, etc. Once the price was rising people started to FOMO in. Then every click bait article out there was about people getting rich on Bitcoin and further adding to the hype. These articles are not written to inform us, they are written and more importantly, titled, to draw us in and generate ad revenue. If the hot topic is getting rich on BTC then that's what they'll pump out in MSM. If it's Bitcoin is tanking then they'll write about that. ",

Crypto have only one purpose : using cryptography to create trust by bypassing 3rd party.
