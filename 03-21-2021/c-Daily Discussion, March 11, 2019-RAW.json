            "Text": "I don\u2019t, I think the lows are in where we had a double bottom at 3350 in early February.  BUT once we break through the 200 day moving average.  It would be expected that there will be a retest of that 200 day moving average after we got to 5000-6000.  Just to prove we\u2019re in a bull market for good.  That will be the last great buying opportunity other than right now.",
