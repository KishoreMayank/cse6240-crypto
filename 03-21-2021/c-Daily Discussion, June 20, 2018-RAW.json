Which means bank is using these cash for their business operations such as lending. And from the other side, people are using tether to buy cryptocurrency. So basically the same 1 USD has been used twice in fiat form and in crypto form. Tether should have the USD not in a bank but in a safe. Tether cannot invest this money not in a bank account not in anywhere. It should be in a safe where no one can access it as it's already being circulated as tether. ",

This is extremely chaotic. In my opinion, tether should have the equivalent amount of fiat money stored in an inaccessible vault. If any fiat to be withdrawn from such vault, the same amount of tether should be burnt. Otherwise tether should cease to exist and all exchanges should implement Fiat deposits and withdrawals with compliance to KYC. \n\n",

            "Text": "Dude, if Coinbase is busted, it'll be another Mt.Gox all over again. BTC and the other tokens trading on Coinbase will go down in flame and all cryptos with it. I don't think crypto will come back from such a disaster.\n\nI'm hopefull that the level of security/insurance is at another level these days though. But we should not wish for Coinbase to go bust ala Mt.Gox because crypto will no recover from it or will take years.\n\nA hack from a reasonnable amount Coinbase would have the liquidity or be insured to bite the bullet would not affect the market as long as users are not impacted and can get away with their money or crypto. But if Coinbase isn't solvent anymore and users are parted from their money/crypto, then it'll be hell when you see the volume of money/crypto Coinbase is dealing with. And I'm not talking about the daily volume, but the total volume that Coinbase is holding at any given time (just look at the freaking order book in Fiat and Crypto, there is an ungodly amount of money on Coinbase).",
