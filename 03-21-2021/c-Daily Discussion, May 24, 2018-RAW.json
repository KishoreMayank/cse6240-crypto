I\u2019m setting up for the long game.\nI\u2019ve written a detailed family manifesto for generations of my descendants to follow. The first few generations will simply hodl and accumulate.\nStarting in 2500, they\u2019ll start buying the planets. Mars first, then working outwards. They\u2019ll rent out the celestial bodies while also selling the natural resources from them.\nEventually, by approx. 2900 my family will have enough Bitcoin to purchase Earth, the birthplace of all humanity, forever cementing my legacy as the greatest hodler of all time.",

As always in such situations: shove emotions in the ass \\(deep\\) and judge soberly.\n\nWe answer the questions:\n\n\\- Is there a fundamental reason for a strong fall?\n\nNo. Not a single tangible strike on bitcoin was not enough, just look into the news. The rate falls, but not because of objective external causes, the fall is speculative \\- the market is replaced by weak hands. In addition, in late spring and many traders are recording profit, which affects the market.\n\n\u00a0\\- Are there any prospects?\n\nYes, I said about them more than once: institutional investors and the solution of regulatory issues are already closed.\n\nIn the end: if your goals are long\\-term, then such moments as now, you need to catch. Buy better in stages \\- part of the purchase now, and part of the strong resistance level 7000\\-7200.\n\nIt's not the one who saddles the wave on the trend \\(then everyone would be millionaires\\), but the one who does not panic and buys at the bottoms. Therefore, there are so few people who are really rich \\- they are patient, weighed, and take unpopular decisions without looking at the mood of the crowd. The mood of the crowd now is to come out. The mood turned \\- to buy. Decide on whose side you are.",

            "Text": "Hi everyone! I have a question! It's pretty dumb! \n\nI have held my bitcoin for a while, over a year or so. It's always been an amount that I could afford to lose, but right now I'm thinking of buying something for myself, and would like to cash out some of my bitcoin. Here's my question: \n\nIf I take out an even number, let's say $1000, and I am in the tax bracket that pays 15% on capital gains, do I simple owe $150 at tax time? I don't know how much the $1000 initially cost, because I bought roughly $30~ week for a long time. Some of it was when it was at $2000 a coin, and some was when it was $19000 a coin! Is my question simple or complex? Thank you!",

            "Text": "Bad. It encouraged speculators and investors who are really turning Bitcoin into a security rather than a currency. This has caused a lot of the blockchain related businesses and innovation to focus on catering to them and that market, rather than help improve usability as a currency for people who want to use it to buy their groceries.\n\nMeanwhile adoption as a currency has flatlined. There's hardly been any progress in any usable businesses for the general public to start using Bitcoin to purchase everyday items. How many of your local stores that you use regularly have started accepting Bitcoin? For most people in the world, the answer is still 0. And that's where the focus should have been, building usability so it can become a currency you can use to buy your every day items. From groceries to gas.",

It\u2019s not quite guaranteed, it\u2019s just highly likely to be worth $100k plus in the intermediate future.\nAlso depends how many new dollars are printed.\n\nThink of Bitcoin this way: the demand side, fiat currency, can be printed infinitely. \nThe supply side, BTC, is incredibly limited, scarce and historically easy to lose.\n\nDo the math. This is the greatest economic shift and opportunity in recent human history. The arbitrage is that most folks aren\u2019t computer scientists or economists, let alone both.

They do however provide services that most people could not afford on their own ie healthcare and infrastructure that allows you to shit down a hole in your house and have water delivered to your taps.

Should we just leave them on the street? Just a few examples. This is not me advocating bloated government or anything, simply outlining that some taxes are justified.\n\nYour answer about schooling is a cop out. Loans are not \"pushed\". I was never offered a loan when I went to school as I decided I wanted to come out of it debt free. No one was trying to push me to get a loan so that's BS. I have never seen/heard a commercial for student loans. Plenty of people on my campus were drinking Starbucks and partying 3-4 nights a week. That's their choice and do not complain about student loans after the fact. Hopefully they got decent jobs. It is that kind of keeping up with the Jones's that handcuffs people, not taxes.\n\nOur top MTR is over 50% here in Canada which is ridiculous. I would be happy with a low flat tax of say 10% and a tax on non-essential consumption i.e don't tax food but tax all non-essentials.\n\nSo is crypto a medium of exchange or a storage of wealth? If everything went haywire and they system collapsed would you rather a few bitcoins or ammo and food?",
