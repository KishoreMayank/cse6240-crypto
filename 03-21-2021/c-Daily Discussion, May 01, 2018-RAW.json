They hold the bitcoins and will offer you fiat back when you want to \"sell\".\n\nPros: Very simple. Just buy and hold.\n\nCons: You will miss out on actually owning Bitcoin. That means you cannot use it in the future. You also miss out on any free forks and airdrops that require a real Bitcoin wallet. You don't get to really experience what cryptocurrency is.
