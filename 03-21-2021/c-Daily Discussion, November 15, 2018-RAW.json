Either that or your only investment is to jump on Reddit and act like a blowhard know it all and tell everyone how stupid they are because you refuse to consider where this is all headed. Crypto is not going away, and some years will be bear and some bull. \n\nAccumulate if you believe that the growing infrastructure and integration will lead to a future where your investment pays off, trade, or walk away. Stressing out over current prices is not healthy and listening to people on here saying bitcoin is dead or bitcoin is going to 100k next month is not healthy either. Bitcoin has been following this familiar pattern for years, so if your accumulating for future potential, a bitcoin is a bitcoin. ",

Its just getting rid of their accumulated btc and distributing it to others. Would prefer them to dump their BTC bags actually. These guys are toxic to the ecosystem and if they want to sell whatever leverage they have left then so be it. They dont care about building a decentralized ecosystem of miners. They only care about  having their own piece of the blockchain world so that they can stay relevant...I dont see enough miners actually believing in this shit. What will probably happen is the same thing always happens with shitcoin hardforks. People will cash in for their free BTC, the price tanks and people happily redistribute their profits. If miner's move so be it. A few big miners will probably move temporarily to compete for a significant portion of the hash rate but at the end of the day we all know BTC is king. ",

But, why I really hate Coinbase today is that they randomly froze all trades for Bcash at 0800 PST without giving us a major indicator. Not that I had any interest in buying BCH, but they do the same thing with Bitcoin. How is that ethical? Maybe they sent an email or wrote a press release but that\u2019s not enough. They should indicate that on the exchange, some ticker cause it ticked me off. It\u2019s still frozen and perhaps I should post this on the Bitcoin main page in hope that it can get their attention. Doubt it but no exchange should catch you offguard but not making such important news extremely easy to see.",

I have never trade off it but I do like to keep an eye on it. Let's go through it: You will see the retrogrades color coded, the left vertical denotes the start of the cycle, the circular shape denotes the slowing down of the planet (middle of the cycle), and the next vertical is the end of the retrograde.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThus far my analysis of the retrogrades since last year is this: At the beginning of the retrograde - whether the cycle is bullish (2017) or bearish (2018) - the cycle continues with the first vertical. The middle circular shape puts a stop to the continuation and slows it down for the upcoming reversal. The second vertical of the retrograde cycle starts the reversal with a subsequent push for several days/weeks beyond. If we were to follow this patterned logic here's my prediction as per the cycle:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNov 17 - Nov 25 (Market keeps falling toward $5000/$4800)\n\nNov 26 - Nov 30 (Market finds bottom and floats sideways)\n\nDec 1 - Dec 6 (Market reverses and heads toward $6000)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDec 7 - Beyond (Slingshot and rejection near mid $6000 level)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above projection is shown by the ghost bar patter, white bars.",

Hashwar or not, no one is able to 51% btc as of yet.\nBch.abc and bch.sv on the other hand face the  hash rate conflict instead. Both have to defend their own chain after the fork for a prolong period of time until the chains stabilise.\n\nSome sha256 miners (like bitmain), who is supportive of bch but ironically has been mining btc (due to higher profit) has dump btc for usd/fiat because btc transaction will take a longer time to process after the sha256 miners switch to help out bch.abc/bch.sv for awhile.\n\nBTC difficulty adjust every two weeks, during the bch internal hashwar miners will need liquidity to sustain the war. Liquidity will be difficult to come by when the btc difficulty hasnt adjust yet. Therefore they sell prematurely, crashing the btc price to 5.5k",

This is being manipulated by a few people.\n\nIf you want to look at something to get kind of a rough idea of maybe what happened in the past and how it is looking to shape out in the future look at January 2015 to jan 2016. Then look at today. If you look at the stochastic and you look at where we are on the Bands. It's really uncanny how similar it is playing out. Like I laughed at these comparisons all year because markets don't repeat. But they actually seem to be.... if this goes just like last time we're going to continue to sell off and create a wick on the monthly candle. We're then going to resume a flat trading range into next summer having another retest of the low along the way. Around the ltc halving you will start to see prices perk up. If that actually happens it's going to be ridiculous because that's what happened last time. Normally I wouldn't even give a thought process like this any credit but this whole year has been going so much like 2014 it's hard not to notice",

But, why I really hate Coinbase today is that they randomly froze all trades for Bcash at 0800 PST without giving us a major indicator. Not that I had any interest in buying BCH, but they do the same thing with Bitcoin. How is that ethical? Maybe they sent an email or wrote a press release but that\u2019s not enough. They should indicate that on the exchange, some ticker cause it ticked me off. It\u2019s still frozen and perhaps I should post this on the Bitcoin main page in hope that it can get their attention. Doubt it but no exchange should catch you offguard but not making such important news extremely easy to see.\n\nI fully agree even though you're getting down voted.",

Which will be bad too (at least he says so). There's also a rumor that Bitmain dumped a lot of BCH for BTC and then BTC for fiat.\n\nThese two morons started the shitshow.

            "Text": "There will be 4000 Bitcoin ATMs installed around the globe in about a week. This has grown rapidly and just the very beginning. We have companies like Fidelity,  Microsoft, Starbucks and more coming into the crypto space. This is the FIRST year we have seen that even being a possibility and there may even be ETF's launched within the next year. There are layering technologies like Lightning Network being implemented and improved upon, more coders joining the BTC dev community and far more user friendly interfaces being created.\n\nSo when you ask where I see this in a few years? For \"ME\", after working for years in IT, security, and digital marketing, it's a no-brainer - the space is maturing and will continue to grow for many many years to come. In that case, the price of the coin would have to catch up to accommodate relative pricing for the limited supply, assuming millions of investors jump in to the space. Once it becomes a strong investment that eventually stabilizes, it would then function as a store of value. Once the masses are using it to store value, the next step would be currency use. That being said, there are also some up-and-comers to keep an eye out for in the space as well, one of them being Stellar. Bottom line? Bitcoin is not going away and you really need to block out the dimwits on here saying stuff about how dumb it is etc.\n\nIt takes a long time for tech to merge into society. Want to see a realistic view of technology pricing in the market over time? Check out the Nasdaq Composite chart! Now consider that modern tech moves at a speed of about 5X faster (one year on the Bitcoin chart = approx 5 yrs on the composite chart). That will really give you lots to think about!",

Hashwar or not, no one is able to 51% btc as of yet. \n\nThis is complete and utter nonsense. Bitmain, as I type this, is the sole producer of ASIC mining chips. They are a literal (not figurative) monopoly. The textbook definition of the word. They have already been shown to have obscured the ownership of mining pools they run, so they could possibly own many, many more. Truth is, we don't know how much hashrate Bitmain controls because we don't know how many ASIC rigs they own - keep in mind they're the SOLE PRODUCER OF ASIC CHIPS. \n\nIt's a massive conflict of interest being the largest mining company and sole provider of ASIC chips. They could, oh I don't know, release chips with slower or inferior tech and hold back the newer ones for themselves. Then release that version when the newer version is in production. Or they could order tens of thousands of chips, hundreds of thousands, and only release a small fraction for sale. Meanwhile, putting those chips into their own mining rigs. \n\nThey've already proven themselves to use dishonest business practices like hide the ownership of mining pools, what else do they do that we are unaware of? Keep in mind this is China, they don't have the same regulations that keep things fair like we have here in the west. \n\n71% of the hashrate [rests within China](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/). Bitmain is located in China and is the sole producer of ASIC chips (required for mining). Do the math. ",

            "Text": "Nice try. The difference is: previous bullrun didn't need average joe. Price from 7000 to 20.000 = average joe investor. What we know from average joe is that he's a one time investor. He gets in, burns his ass, and gets out. It was the same during .com bubble. He won't come back. That's why it took 16 years for Microsoft to get back at ath. The january crash of crypto IS the .com bubble for crypto. Once average joe is in the game, crash happens and it takes a long long time before intrinsic value of an asset matches the speculative value during hype/bubble. In fact, average joe is always the one who fucks everything up. It's all about intrinsic value now, that means adoption. It's going to take a long, very long time before adoption rate slowly goes up and crypto and blockchain start to get real value in society. Much longer than previous bearmarket. One thing is for sure: the speculative days are over. Don't expect new investors in the coming years. In 5 or 6 years, btc might have a value of 100.000. Until then, nothing is to be expected.  ",

            "Text": "Hell yea brotha man! Now we're talking!\n\nI end up not even visiting this sub due to the common denominator here being so frantic 24/7 but as a day trader doing decent for himself (nothing crazy) I always saw there was no way btc would fall out of favour with how much money there is already for such a \"young\" boom. As long as my cryptos outperform my accounts and overtime outperform my retirement account I see no reason to leave. You can always buy early in a bull run as I say.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only question for me is if it would be btc, in particular, that would surge forward and break ground while a better more ?stable? crypto would take its place but still hasn't seemed to have happened in the past two years. \n\nFunny enough I started bitcoin after starting a computer making business in high school in 2010/11 and with all the deals I got on gfx cards buying in bulk. It was as innocent as I thought the concept was cool and not for monetary reasons. Never in a million years did i ever think it would ever it $1,000 let alone $10,000. I distinctively remember asking my parents for $50 when btc was .50 in Jan of 2011 and freaked out when it hit $10 and sold off everything. \n\nHindsight is 20/20 as they say but damn if that was not a rush at age 16.  \n\n\nwhen did you get into the space? I've always been more of a finance/ business guy but recently with my off time been thinking about working in applied mathematics and cs possibly.",

See if you know any other investment asset that can boast of such a prediction from its naysayers :-)\n\nAnd to be honest, that is the kind of timeframe one should have in mind for crypto. You come in for short term gains, be ready to probably get burned. If you can stick out 5 to 7 years, then the risks are far far lower. I have no beef against this view.\n\nHowever I disagree that the Dec 2017 bubble was any different from the previous bitcoin bubbles we have seen. It is just the same pattern that should not surprise anyone who cared to study the previous price action patterns and the reasons thereof. There are just more number of Joes involved than the previous bubbles but notably this number is still a very minute fraction of the number of Joes who can get involved in future.\n\nRead and re-read this to understand this seemingly disastrous price action:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da",

This is why it has always respected long term trend. \n\nEdit:  in other words since the market is still in its early days, it is highly susceptible to the wills of mega whales with agendas. The natural growth of the market cannot sustain that kind of assault in the short term.  Or it will at least have difficulty maintaining its equilibrium point.

Apparently there's actual emails with him involved in the beginning?  however, the computer scientist ppl involved with Bitcoin all say its bullshit.  My pea brain obviously sides with them.
