The only folks who leave wealth in BTC for longer than it takes to move it are the people who (1) expect to transfer it again shortly, (2) have no better currency available for short\\-term storage or (3) hope it will go up in value again sometime in the future. The latter dominates the market cap at this point, and that's why the price is most easily understood using game theory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)). \n\nThe bottom will come when everyone on this /r/ has gone home and no longer gives a damn about the price. If you want to buy in at the bottom, remember that you'll be the only idiot you know who would even think of buying BTC on the day you do it \\- you will feel mighty lonely. You will have watched some exchanges close, some news sites shut down, the number of active folks on this /r/ drop by 4/5, the twitter\\-verse go silent on BTC and the media start running BTC retrospectives.",

I'm sure they are concerned about tether and I'm sure they want to make sure the exchanges actually have all of the coins that are being traded. Basically they want an audit. It seems likely at least one exchange has something up. I wonder who's cooking the Books or if they will try to cover it up before they get audited",

An entirely new collaborative digital economy will have been built in plain sight on the internet by people who understand the future of the species cannot be safeguarded by those people playing zero sum games, whose actions are contributing to human misery and inequity of wealth, the likes of which we've never seen before.\n\nNow, more than ever, we need remarkable people to take responsibility and use this technology we're all so in love with to fix the rot at the heart of all this. That requires complete systemic change and a new way of looking at things.\n\nIt's worth remembering that was the very reason bitcoin was created. It is not a speculative vehicle to continue the same business as usual. Those treating it as such, will need to take a long hard look in the mirror when all this begins to make sense and ask which side of history they want to tell future generations they stood on.\n\n\"In his 2013 answer to the annual Edge magazine question, Eric Weinstein made a distinction between two very different kinds of people: the \u201cexcellent\u201d and the \u201cremarkable\u201d. The former, he says, have optimized for playing and winning the current dominant game. They have gone to the best schools. They have worked at the best institutions. They have excelled. Echoing evolutionary theory, he calls them \u201chill climbers\u201d \u2013 and if you need to climb a hill, they are the right people to call.\n\nBut if the challenge is not to climb some well understood hill, but to cross the \u201cadaptive valley\u201d of the unknown, the excellent are woefully unprepared. If you need to wander through uncertainty in search of an as yet poorly understood but potentially vastly superior game, you need to call on an entirely different kind of person: the remarkable.\u201d\n\nhttps://neurohacker.com/ethos",

I love the tech and believe it is the future. But, I'd also like to make decent money with my investments in Bitcoin and all other quality cryptos. Who wouldn't? \n\nRegardless of what the naysayers are feeding you, Bitcoin will rebound big and reach all time highs by the end of 2018. And yes, this view is just as valid as those saying it will go to 4k, or be in a bear market for 2 years. However, if you actually read the analytics, Bitcoin is technically not in a bear market yet. And, with the degree of manipulation in this market, I wouldn't be surprised if this recent plunge is to shake weakies for the next boost. We still are not even close to February lows, so I'm not sure why people lose their shit over a little dip. Higher lows keep posting month after month. And, very soon more and more institutional money will flood the market. If people continue to monitor the small day trends looking to make money and complain and scare off new investors when that doesn't happen, they will continue to be disappointed.  But, if they step back to look at the big picture, remain patient, and HODL, bitcoin is easily the best investment out there currently. After all the pissing and moaning, bitcoin is still up 135% on the year. Even if it is half that percentage next year, where else can you get that kind of return on your money?",

Imagine if many people did the same thing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>**Once upon a time, there was an old man who\u00a0used to go to the ocean to do his writing.** He had a habit of walking on the beach every morning before he began his work. Early one morning,\u00a0he was walking along the shore after a\u00a0big storm had passed and found the\u00a0vast\u00a0beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see, stretching in both directions.\u00a0  \n>  \n>Off in the distance,\u00a0the old man\u00a0noticed a small boy approaching.\u00a0 As the boy walked, he paused every so often\u00a0and as he grew closer, the man could see that\u00a0he was occasionally bending down to pick up an object and throw it into the sea.\u00a0\u00a0The boy came closer still and the man called out,\u00a0\u201cGood morning! \u00a0May I ask what it is that you are doing?\u201d  \n>  \n>The young boy paused, looked up, and replied \u201cThrowing starfish into the ocean. The tide has washed them up onto the beach and they can\u2019t return to the sea by themselves,\u201d the youth replied. \u201cWhen the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw them back into the water.\u201d  \n>  \n>The old man replied, \u201cBut there must be tens of\u00a0thousands of\u00a0starfish on this beach. I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t really be able to make\u00a0much of a difference.\u201d  \n>  \n>The\u00a0boy bent down, picked up yet another starfish and threw it as far as he could into the ocean. Then he turned, smiled and said, \u201cIt made a difference to that one!\u201d  \n>  \n>*adapted from* [*The Star Thrower*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156849097?ie=UTF8&tag=mc_starfish-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0156849097)*,* *by Loren Eiseley (1907 \u2013 1977)*\n\n&nbsp;",

Bitcoin is old news, and the FOMO's are gone. \n\nWe have reached the point where, like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal, and CashApp, you hit a maximum saturation and people get bored and go back to banks and cash. \n\nPeople didn't get into Bitcoin to actually USE bitcoin, they got into bitcoin because they wanted to be overnight millionaires. It's a lot like the Poker boom 12 years ago. Suddenly everyone rushed into playing poker to make millions like the guys on tv with the lambo's. The reality is it doesn't work like that for the remaining 99% of us. The same is true with Bitcoin. \n\nAt this point in time, people with much much bigger bankrolls than you or I, control the price of Bitcoin every second of every day. Their large massive buys and sells can make them money, not us, and they really don't care about long term. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's a game of chess, and when you are one of the pawns, you still have zero power and such a small piece of the pie that overnight millionaires for the 99% of us is unreachable.",

And yes, this view is just as valid as those saying it will go to 4k, or be in a bear market for 2 years.\n\nBoth views are invalid because they are just random guesses, but dropping to $4k is obviously far more plausible. That's just a 42 % price move, which is obviously far more likely than the 200% price move you need to get to an ATH.\n\n>However, if you actually read the analytics, Bitcoin is technically not in a bear market yet.\n\nA bear market is a 20% price drop from the high. Bitcoin is 65% down, so it's deep in to the bear market. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend#Bear_market\n\n> We still are not even close to February lows\n\nWe're only a few hundred dollars above the February lows, but $13k below the December highs\n\n>Higher lows keep posting month after month. \n\nThe current price on June 11 is far lower than the May low and the lowest point in 2 months. March was the only month where the low was higher than the previous month. \n\n> And, very soon more and more institutional money will flood the market.\n\nThat's an absurd belief.\n\n> After all the pissing and moaning, bitcoin is still up 135% on the year. Even if it is half that percentage next year, where else can you get that kind of return on your money?\n\nThere is no reason to think it will go up next year. It's down over 60% in less than 6 months. It may recover some of the losses over the next few years, but it's more likely that it will keep moving down or move sideways. \n\nBitcoin fans love to compare bitcoin to gold. However, gold has also gone through many long bear markets and it's long term return is terrible. Gold prices peaked at $1895 per ounce in 2011, and there is no evidence that will get anywhere close to that high again any time soon.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "Text": "It's normal. There are 3 types of users for BTC right now: (1) Money\\-senders, (2) Savers and (3) Speculators. Money senders don't care about the long\\-term trend or price of a coin, but they need the price to be stable long enough to send some value to someone else. Savers don't care about short\\-term (hours) fluctuations, but they definitely don't want the value to go down over the long term (years). Traders care about daily price changes and are the folks driving the trading volume right now, sending it up wildly one day and dumping the next to take profits. \n\nWe are in a consolidation phase right now where the largest traders are pumping and then dumping, rinse\\-and\\-repeat, trying to suck the last drops of cash out of the small\\-time traders. The market fundamentals are driven by the Money\\-senders and Savers, but those folks are scared away by volatility, so I would expect things to continue to flatten (no big, sustained pumps) for a few more months. Once the regulatory stuff starts to shape up (clarity and uniformity) and the payments infrastructure starts to get more widely rolled out then those users will start to come back and add to the market cap again. that will bring the price back up over the next few years (hopefully in a nice smooth way, a few percent a month, with daily volatility less than 3&#37;).",

The service was $25, so I just bought $100 just for shits-and-giggles.  That small purchase did see a 10x increase in less than 6 months.  \n\nI have no interest in buying more BTC as an investment, nor do I think is a good investment.  They way i see it... If you follow the \"don't invest more than you can afford to lose\", that amount won't make much of an impact to your wealth.  The people that are \"all in\", could make a mint if BTC could drastically rise, but I think the risks greatly outweigh the rewards.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that in October 2017 when BTC took a big shit from their all-time high (~$20K) and big financial institutions started trading bitcoin ETFs at the same time.   These institutions make million-dollar single transactions which can affect the market much more than the Average Joe who buys $100 worth of BTC here-and-there.  \n\n>Eventually price must follow value.\n\nObviously, BTC is worth what people are willing to pay for it, but BTC really has no intrinsic value.  It's not backed by any type of earnings or assets.",

You are right that tether is used as an intermediary to provide liquidity and avoid orders being placed in fiat, but it gives far more liquidity to Bitcoin than any other crypto.\n\nBottom line is until a viable crypto that is not a stable-coin decouples its price from Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be the de-facto standard.",

You never really know how bad it's going to get but so far there have not been any red flags whatsoever. The time to worry is when you see a major coins getting 51% attacked which could only happen if the price really tanks and we lose a ton of hash power and most importantly you see people like the Winklevoss Twins and bitmain backing out. Now if that happens we have trouble. Right now the cycle is on schedule to do what it's going to do. \n\nThis Market is more profitable for everyone when it goes up. However that does not mean you make the most profit by always having it go up. As we found out in December everyone and their dog gets into crypto when the price goes on a run and at that point you really can't buy anymore. It's ridiculously expensive for the time. If you're going to learn from the past 9 years there's one way to make this work. You buy when everyone is panicking and you sit back and go do something else and wait. Run your miners and accumulate because when this goes on the run again you're not going to be able to buy mining equipment and the cost to buy the coins is going to be very high which should be the market you sell into. Or you can be like a lot of people and sell the bottom and buy the top",

Daily trading volume is \\~60\\-80k BTC, so that 1.8k represents a small percentage change in supply (2\\-3&#37;) \\- certainly not enough to move the price very dramatically. I wouldn't expect a 1.5&#37; change in supply to suddenly move the price much (or maybe not at all, at this point).",

            "Text": "Yeah I actually had thoughts about all of that. The thing about this Market is you can't really value it. At least not yet. The most similar is probably the.com era because that was a lot of euphoria but again this one is different. I really hate using that line because it's usually what people say right before a crash. We already had a 1999 happen in 2013. Now we had another one. Also keep in mind the FED is what killed the Kool-Aid in the.com era. Once they raised interest rates and lending dried up that was it. \n\nWe have an established 9-year uptrend with Bitcoin. We still have a lot of big money investors. We still have no signs of them selling. The.com crash also gave way to better tech companies. The only reason AOL is not Google is because of bad management. AOL could have been Google. Easy. Bitcoin is probably going to face that test and if it fails Roger ver is going to be right there to pick up the pieces. It is however exactly like you say. A reasonably unpredictable emerging-market. I certainly would not invest enough money in this that it would keep me up at night. I knew when I got into Bitcoin the best strategy would be to get in after the sell-off happened and then turn off the screen and wait. Possibly cost average in along the way and run a miner. To me that's the best risk-reward but everyone has to make that decision themselves",

There is no underlying tangible asset. If it goes to zero, it goes to zero. When a company goes to zero (if its worth investing in) it has buildings, equipment, patents etc to sell.",

The company went from bleeding money to only losing $0.01 a share on the last earnings report. Add in any kind of favorable situation with North Korea and I have a potential for a 50% stock here by the end of the year. That I can rationally argue. Bitcoin on the other hand.
