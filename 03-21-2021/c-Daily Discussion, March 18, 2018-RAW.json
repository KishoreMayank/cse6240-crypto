That's exactly what is happening whenever Bitcoin moves either direction at the moment.\n\nBitcoin loses value, Alt lose double/tripple their value.\n\nBitcoin wins value, Alts cannot keep up with gains from Bitcoin.\n\nThis is why, despite going down and sinking hard, the dominance is almost going up faster than before, now being close to 46%. Gotta give it to the dips man, they're healthy for Crypto it really does feel like it. All the hype is shaken off all of these ICOs that haven't delivered a single thing, but a white paper, but are worth billions of dollars?\n\nAll recent news is good and Bitcoin will probably exit g20 on a positive note, and who will not leave on a positive note or at least is heavily endagered? ICOs.\n\nSeems like that dominance going back up could this time be a more long'ish trend. At first Ithought we'd see a stop 48%, but this really looks like, with a BTC bullrun always coming first, we might head up to values of 62-65%, obviously possible higher.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

That's exactly what is happening whenever Bitcoin moves either direction at the moment.\n\nBitcoin loses value, Alt lose double/tripple their value.\n\nBitcoin wins value, Alts cannot keep up with gains from Bitcoin.\n\nThis is why, despite going down and sinking hard, the dominance is almost going up faster than before, now being close to 46%. Gotta give it to the dips man, they're healthy for Crypto it really does feel like it. All the hype is shaken off all of these ICOs that haven't delivered a single thing, but a white paper, but are worth billions of dollars?\n\nAll recent news is good and Bitcoin will probably exit g20 on a positive note, and who will not leave on a positive note or at least is heavily endagered? ICOs.\n\nSeems like that dominance going back up could this time be a more long'ish trend. At first Ithought we'd see a stop 48%, but this really looks like, with a BTC bullrun always coming first, we might head up to values of 62-65%, obviously possible higher.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Even some hodlers were expecting they'd have to take a bounce from 6000 ...\n\nSo here is my (not so serious) take: when even the amateur league at the bitcoin sub starts to talk about shorting, it's time to close any short position you might have.\n\nEDIT: to answer your question: what you are wishing for is a resistance, not a support, and a bounce to a lower price than what you sold. I personally think 8150 will be reached again. It may take hours, days or weeks, or I might be plain wrong. We will see.\n",

The current price will likely dip a bit further but at some point good old FOMO will kick in perhaps as soon as the G20 crypto meetings pass on Monday and Tuesday perhaps April onwards who knows but I do not believe we see sub $5000 again other than an exchange being hacked (heaven forbid) HODL.",

            "Text": "Complicated maths Equations ;-) however I believe without GPU mining hashing power would be even more controlled by ASICs mining and even greater crypto price manipulation. Hopefully Nvidia (or AIB's) will release more crypto specific cards like the Nvidia P102-100 Inno3D being the latest to free up supply to give gamers a greater chance to purchase current or next gen cards at MSRP. It looks like next Nvidia cards are Q3 2018 though :-) which will likely sell out meaning best chance is to place pre-orders at several retailers and cancel when one order is confirmed. At least some retailers are limiting cards to '1' per customer and this will likely be a trend which continues.",

If we skip the cross we may be safe for the time being and possibly enter an uptrend. If not we crash hard in a matter of days. I wouldn't be too concerned by this stuff though, in my opinion it's garbage for the most part.",

Question is do you believe they are or not? \n\nThere tends to be this sentiment that selling during a dip is wrong and that's because people always assume it's going to bounce up and higher. But there have been many dips sold that didn't turn out to be the bottom. \n\nSo on either side - nobody knows for sure. One could claim that buying @ $7500 may turn out to be just as foolish granted they didn't plan to take profit when it pumped again. \n\n",

However, the death cross is a true danger. Many big traders and many bots trust these signals and I'm pretty certain they will sell a lot if the cross completes its shape. In the event the market will crash it won't happen because of the death cross but because of the reaction to it.\n\n\\*edit\\* also, this: the last death cross was on september 14, 2015 and look where BTC was two months after that\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/QiTlHkxP/",

Its also becoming clearer to the finance world that it would be unwise to not have at least 1% exposure to Bitcoin.  Its the perfect hedge to our current system.  In addition, the symbology and technology and the power of holding Bitcoin in your possession in your private keys is being completely undervalued and under appreciated.  And once its in cold storage you have no risk to computer or phone hack or some other catastrophe.  \n\nIn addition Currencies don't have a fixed price.  The dollar for example is down over 15% since Trump took office.  As the market for crypto and Bitcoin mature/increase the volatility will diminish and it will behave more like a typical currency.
