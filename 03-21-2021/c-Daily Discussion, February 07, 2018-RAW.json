Like this one.https://ethereumworldnews.com/author/rebecca/\nAll her recent news article were negetive stance on every news that was related to crypto. Now also she is posting the India is 'taking steps' to make crypto illegal. Which is COMPLETELY FALSE. India is trying to make regulations on profits made on crypto, which doesnt make 'crypto illegal'. Is there a way were we can track down such FUD creators and dislike their news articles and push them aside?",

They are sucker plays, bull traps, speculators' paradise, orgies of oddlotter mentality or expressions of dumb institutional complacency (or both). They often involve a focus on a narrow list of stocks, are often 'unconfirmed' by other averages, are rarely technically strong, and are virtually always doomed to complete retracement by c-wave. If the analyst can easily say to himself, 'there is something wrong with this market', chances are it's a b-wave.\"\n\nSpeculative and idealised Elliott Wave model indicative of price and structure, not time:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fZkBsRM.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/thk6hWP.png",

            "Text": "Question for the Bitcoin Community - As part of my college course I am currently enrolled in a module much of which is centered around the history of bitcoin . I am completely new to the world Bitcoin and still finding my feat in terms of understanding everything so please go easy on my below post in terms of things that may be wrong or dont fit with your views on bitcoin . As part of the course we are currently looking at the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash - if you've a few minutes read the below and let me know whats right and wrong and what else I need to know about the split in the community in terms of parties working in both communities , issues and solutions to both parties ideas. \n\nI appreciate any feedback you could give. \n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\nAugust 2017 we saw the creation of a hard fork from Bitcoin\u2019s original blockchain ledger. The fork was created as a result of a debate that caused a split into the bitcoin community. The debate was centered around the issue of scalability in the bitcoin blockchain . The following outlines below what I believe to be the arguments presented by both users of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash on how best to solve the scalability issue . Open to any corrections of details people may have on either sides arguments . \n\nThe Issue of Scalability.\n\nUnder satoshis original whitepaper for Bitcoin we know that individual\u2019s transactions are grouped together to form blocks. Each block has its own blockhash made up of four key components \n1)\tThe Hash of the previous block \n2)\tA time stamp of the new block \n3)\tThe merkle tree root hash which is the method by which transaction are bundled together from the transaction slush pool  with the first transaction hash in the bunch being the coinbase of that bundle . \n4)\tNonce \u2013 This is the puzzle minors need to solve in order to complete the block . To solve the puzzle requires brut computing force so minors must expend computer processing power to find the value randomly that satisfies the puzzle. Upon finding the value the blocks hash is then complete and at this point the block is added to the blockchain .\n\nWhen a block is added to the blockchain a miner ie the person whos cpu solved the nonce to create the block is rewarded in two ways \u2013 1stly with the issue of newly minted bitcoin  and 2ndly with all the transaction fees that people wishing to send bitcoin transactions to attach to their transactions . \n\nThe issue with scalability surrounding the blockchain prior to August 2017 was that each block could had a maximum blocksize of 1MB which allowed for roughly 250,000 transaction per day to be processed . The issue was that as more and more people began to use the Bitcoin network it began to run slower as users who were unwilling to pay higher fees had to wait longer for their transactions to be added from the slush to a block and confirmed . How to solve this issue of scalability in the blockchain is what ultimately lead to the forking of the blockchain in August 2017 and the creation of Bitcoin Cash .\n\nBitcoins solution to scalability \u2013 \nBitcoins solution to its scalability issue include the creation of both Segregated Witness ( Segwit ) and lightning protocols. Segwit was introduced to increase the blockchain blocksize from 1mb to a maximum of 4mb with the current protocol allowing for blocks to be 2mbs in size . Segwit also allowed for the creation of layered networks on the bitcoin protocol that will ultimately lead into the adoption of the lightning network . \n\nThe lightening network is a way in which payments can be chained together outside of the blockchain. It works by allowing participants to transactions interact only twice with the blockchain ledger , once to open and once to close a set of transaction . In-between the opening and closing participants enforce digital IOUs against one another with either party having the option to end the current transaction string of IOUs and cash out for the balancing amount . \n\nBitcoin Cash\u2019s Solution to scalability . \nBitcoin Cash creators changed bitcoins protocol such that the block size was increased from 1Mb to 8MB thus allowing for more transactions to be confirmed in each block helping the network to run quicker . \n\nIf you owned Bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017 you also own Bitcoin Cash ( I Think) . Because the chains forked I think so do the public and private key address in the underlying system which means if you sign into a wallet that supports bitcoin cash you\u2019ll find some which at the time I wrote this was roughly 952 USD per coin . Is this correct? \n\nThanks for all your feedback.",

            "Text": "Electricity  can effectively be free. The cheapest way to generate *new* electricity is now renewable energy (excluding carbon subsidies). PV solar and wind have very low costs. It is possible to use Bitcoin mining to reduce volatility in energy prices and improve the business case for building out renewable energy generation by eliminating revenue variability: BTC mining can consume off-peak energy produced and provide a reliable way to fully utilize the renewable energy produced for maximum ROI. \n\nTo your point, the total energy consumed may well be more, but it is consumed in a way that allows it to make use of excess energy that would otherwise have no value (the alternative would be storing it somehow, which is expensive, rather than revenue-generating). \n\nIf you were to count the many tens of thousands of existing servers running software that is obsoleted by Bitcoin, along with the economic costs of the thousands of people who are looking after all of that heterogeneous legacy infrastructure, you might find that the environmental impact (carbon production, land use, workforce productivity per unit of economic capacity consumed) would be less if Bitcoin were used as a substitute. I have read a few studies along these lines but none that (in our view) avoided arbitrarily treating some important costs as external to the model(s).",

It's a cycle.\n\nDisregard what *everyone* says about what happens next - nobody knows the future no matter what their \"analysis\" shows. As has been proven in this market time and time again. Do a bit of investigating what Bitcoin is. Decide for yourself whether or not this kind of tech has a place in the world. Then either buy some or don't. \n\nAnd if you absolutely have to trade... ffs stop reacting to market moves after they already happened. That's how you lose your money. We've just witnessed a major downturn from the other side of 19K. Selling at 6K... omg! A bit late, aren't you? Sometimes I swear people are actively trying to see how cheap they can get rid of their BTC. When in doubt... just hold your coin and try to see more than a few weeks or months into the future.\n\nBitcoin is not dying. It's from the Iron Islands, okay?",

            "Text": "Mostly true, but missed the ASICBOOST patent as being the real reason bcash was supported by one large miner. Read this: https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/a8155df5051bb3e3aa96#segwit-is-being-blocked-because-it-breaks-asicboost-a-patented-optimization-used-by-bitmain-asic-manufacturer\n\nThe first update that bcash developers did was remove all the code that broke ASICBOOST.\n\nWe prefer to call the altcoin created \"bcash\" instead of \"bitcoin cash\" because we perceive the latter as trying to steal bitcoin's name. BCash is much less confusing to newbs as well, many have made a mistake when trading and bought the wrong cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother problem is lightning is mischaracterized by talking about ICOs. There's no owing or counterparty risk in the lightning protocol. A better analogy might be a caching layer for transactions before they go on the blockchain.\n\nThe UASF movement is also missed out and I think it's very interesting. The miners were blocking segwit and UASF was a way to activate segwit regardless of what the miners did. It required building support from bitcoin users and businesses and it activated on 1st August 2017 which was the reason why the altcoin BCash created then. It was a final tantrum by some miners when they realized that UASF forced their hand.",

            "Text": "Math. A lot of people, especially in this community, believe Bitcoin is a product and service which will have a global demand and widespread utility. If that is the case then the current value is exponentially lower than it's value at maturity.  This is because of very basic undisputed principles of economics.\n\nPeople don't argue over whether a global product and service in demand with high utility and limited supply would have a mindboggling large value. It's mathematically certain. The debate lies in the question \"Does Bitcoin fulfill this description?\"  Either Bitcoin does and is horrendously undervalued in historical terms, or Bitcoin does not and has no essential value as a monetary product anyways.\n\nThere are some very real monetary needs, on the global scale, that bitcoin is on track to fulfill. These can be hard to see if you live in a first world country with comparatively well managed treasury, so I recommend watching any Andreas Antonopolous video where he speaks on the Greek collapse and Venezuelan inflation crisis.\n\nSo either Bitcoin has value, in which case these are the very early years, or this is all an illusion and we are playing internet monopoly.",

Comic books from the 50s are worth tons because no kids back then thought about preserving them... Comic books from the 90s are worth jack squat because everyone bought up all the #1 issues and protected them in sleeves thinking they'd be worth millions. They are worth less now than their original price in some cases.\n\nIf too many people get the idea of preserving something for future profits, then there's going to be an abundance of that something in the future so the price won't change.",

We regard correlation as net negative, in the sense that it will show us that the BTC exchange price is heavily weighted by sentiment toward BTC as an investible asset. We regard the 'core' value of BTC to be its utility as a means of payment and store of value. We would like to see a loose relationship with the equities markets, since those are dominated by investors (rather than folks transacting or storing value).\n\nOn the bright side, however, a clear correlation would help us trade more effectively in the near term.",

I know if I had personally sold at say 18k, i would of definitely bought back in at 10k.  Then Id owe income tax versus capital gains, when if i had not sold and waited a year just capital gains.

Growing up as a kid I knew one kid that had a MAC. Everyone else had a c-64 or others. I still don't get how they survived back then. Today I don't now one person that owns any computer from apple but the ipod and phones saved them. A good example is the Amiga made by commodore was the best computer around when it came out in 1985 and was the best until something happened. You did not need to upgrade it so all the hardware companies were angry and they would not allow any operating system from Gates so you probably know what happened to them. The gorilla ate them.",

Six months in the future comes and now you sell at $40k.  You're suggesting it would have been better to hold from $250 to $40k instead of selling and rebuying along the way.\n\nLet's do the math...\n\nUsing 10 BTC as an example, you buy at $250 over a year ago.  That's $2500 in dirty fiat money, gaining you 10 beautiful bitcoins.  \n\nNow bitcoin is worth $18k, and you decide to sell.  You trade in your riches for a filthy $180,000 USD.  You pay $26,625 in long term capital gains taxes, leaving you $153,375.  \n\nNow the price has fallen to $10k/BTC and you buy 15.3375 BTC.  It feels good to be back.  Then six months later the price rises to $40k and you decide to sell your BTC so you can buy some moon boots.  You get $613,500 USD.  But oh no! Now you owe some taxes at the 33% short term capital gains rate. That's $153,375 in taxes, oof.   Your final balance is $**460,125** USD and 0 BTC.\n\nAlternatively, you bought 10 BTC at $250 in the year 200X and hold them until you sell six months from now at $40k.  You get $400,000 and owe $59,625 in long term capital gains taxes.  Your final balance is $**340,375** and 0 BTC.\n\nAvoiding taxes isn't everything. ",

            "Text": "On most exchanges, you can buy BTC with Tether.  The largest being Bitfinex, which has same owners as Tether.  The mechanism to pump up BTC in USD is not difficult if the allegation that Tether is not backed by USD is true.  (a) Generate Tether, (b) Use Tether to buy BTC using higher Tether/BTC than prevailing USD/BTC rate, (c) arbitrage will occur where people will buy BTC using USD and sell them for Tether at higher price.  Net result - USD/BTC price increases.",

            "Text": "I'm totally not trying to be a dick, but at most I think of bitcoin as an alternative investment, like gold.  It's a scare resource, reasonable demand, etc.  But how can it be treated like a currency, when it's also valued (at astronomical prices) as an investment?  Also, how can it become a fully functioning currency when governments will do everything in their power to tax/regulate/etc?  The only way I see bitcoin becoming a fully functioning currency is literally by the end of government as we know it.  \n\nEdit:  I guess what I'm getting at, is fundamentally I don't understand how bitcoin can be viewed as a means of investment and returns, yet at the same time, supposed to be a currency which would go against the very nature of an investment.  Is the thinking that you hold until it skyrockets at $100k?  And then at that point, no more volatility, and everyone jumps in?  And then from there you hold all this wealth and everyone else theoritically starts at the bottom?  What is a currency that encourages people to buy, but not actually use?   ",

            "Text": "Absolutely right. The specific levers that the Federal Reserve has are money supply (creation/destruction of notes and creation of debt) and interest rates on short and long-term borrowing by banks. It can add more liquidity and take it away at will, to adjust for demand and thereby control the rate of inflation. The US government also has the ability to control demand directly by adjusting tax rates and fees that are only payable in US dollars, and by issuing payments to personnel and suppliers in USD. While the government cannot arbitrarily make the value of a USD whatever they want, they can guide it pretty significantly and thereby guarantee relatively stable levels of purchasing power and volatility. This is what makes it a more desirable currency for some purposes than BTC. I don't think this is what most folks mean when they say \"backed by the US government\", but these are real benefits. They come with a lot of baggage, too, of course.",

            "Text": "Bitcoin is (1) a trade good, (2) a store of value and (3) investment-class asset. \n\nOn (1): It is a trade good because it's technically not a currency, but it is an asset with a liquid market. The fiat exchange rate for it isn't relevant for this use case because you typically trade your other valuable currencies/assets for BTC, then give the BTC to the other party in exchange for whatever it is you want from them that is denominated in BTC. You buy as much as you need and as long as the value doesn't change too much during the transaction you can get the value to the other party without losing any in the process. The fiat exchange value of a BTC doesn't really matter at all, in this case, since BTC are divisible. 1-2% daily volatility in exchange value is probably not an issue, since an end-to-end transaction typically takes 3 hours (assuming the fee on all three sub-transactions - you buy the BTC, you transfer the BTC, other party sells BTC - is high enough to get them each in the next block).\n\nOn (2): A store of value is not an investment, because the primary goal of storing value is not losing any value while it's stored - there is no consideration for 'increasing' value at all, in this case. Fiat currencies are poor stores of value because they are deliberately devalued by the state banks that control demand and supply. State banks do this to prevent people from using the money supply to store value. For most people, this 'store of value' use would be analogous to a savings account with a bank account (i.e. one that that pays just enough interest to offset inflation). People seem use BTC this way when traditional banking is not available or is unreliable/untrustworthy. Zimbabwe and Venezuela come to mind. For this case, daily volatility is less of an issue, but long term volatility (months or years) is the concern: exchange value can increase, but users must have a high degree of trust that it will not decrease.\n\nOn (3): An investment assumes growth in value. The finite supply of BTC forces the exchange value of a BTC to increase as there is more demand for BTC. The 'core' demand for BTC comes from (1) and (2). The growth in the exchange value of BTC makes it an investment. As the inflow of capital slows near the top of the adoption s-curve, the rate of increase in value will slow. As growth slows and the BTC user base expands the law of large numbers will drive a drop in volatility until the speculative component of the overall market capitalization of BTC becomes a reflection on broad-based economic growth. BTC may never stop growing in value, because the world continues to create more wealth than it expends on an annualized basis and the 'left-over' wealth that we generate needs to be stored somewhere. That excess wealth may go into many types of value stores, but if BTC is sufficiently trustworthy and liquid it will pick up its fair share simply because of its privacy and convenience.\n\nThe BTC adoption s-curve is a 20 year curve (in our opinion) and we are not quite 1/2 way there. We expect sharp growth and continued high volatility (and more crashes, followed by fresh all-time highs) for the next 24-36 months.",

That\u2019s like saying majority of people like the temperature to be read in Celsius so we  will put it in Fahrenheit as a compromise (not a great example)... anyhow the mods explained majority of the traffic to the sub comes from US and Europe so in that case it\u2019s fine and I concede, I\u2019m just personally annoyed to have to wait till 2pm everyday to comment on a daily thread (I don\u2019t want to comment on yesterday\u2019s thread in the mornings even though it may still be active cause it seems psychologically backwards).

You must be delusional comparing that to a crypto. You could compare bitcoin to one company of the s&p 500 when you take the small benefits of btc that could create any value to our society. Wealth isnt created out of nothing. The dollar is a unit. The 21 trillion were created by hundreds of years of value creation. Everything that build our modern society is in that cap. How is that even remotely the same as btv. It doesnt create jobs, food, products. ",

It shares some qualities that can be compared to these when discussing the theoretical effects of crypto on the world, and we can only discuss these things in theory because something like Cryptocurrency has never happened before.

            "Text": "We did an analysis for one of our clients on the hypothesis that the BTC market cap is a combination of (1) Currency substitution: users buying BTC for the purpose of executing transactions, (2) Value storage: folks buying BTC and holding them (i.e. in lieu of a savings account, no expectation of *increase* in value) and (3) Speculation: buying BTC as an investment which *will appreciate in value*. We looked at trading volumes on exchanges, the distribution of trades at different sizes, survey data from users (self-reported) and some sane but otherwise unscientific postulation about the implication of BTC/USD trading history on Bitstamp and GDAX compared with a few other currencies (ZWL, RMB, KRW, VEF). \n\nOur estimate is approximately ~$100B for the currency and savings core users with an added amount for long-term HODLers (speculators that will not sell, regardless of performance). This is imprecise, because it's really, really hard to get data about usage of a system that is designed to be highly distributed and private. That said, our client was comfortable with our proposal that there is a firm floor of $6.5-7k USD/BTC. We know that panic selling could drive the price per BTC down for brief periods, as could periods of network congestion that drive fees up too high. In general, we don't see any scenario that would result in a sustained exchange value below the $6.5-7k range. \n\nAs always, you need to come to your own conclusions and I can't really offer you any advice about what to expect. I can't give you any more details on our study either, given that we don't own the rights to the work we did. I suggest you mull it over and think about how you might be able to get data to help you size each of the three buckets I mentioned so you can come to your own number. Don't trade based on my numbers - those are just an example from one study.",
