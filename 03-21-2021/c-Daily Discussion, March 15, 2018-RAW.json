The only part of the technology that keeps tripping me up is this:\n\nIf there's no central authority governing bitcoin, how does the concept of the \"private key\" work?  As I understand, the public key is essentially an \"address\" at which bitcoin is received, and the distributed ledger creates a situation where everyone knows that address \"12345\" has 1 bitcoin.  The private key is necessary to spend that 1 bitcoin, and can confirm that against the ledger that everyone is keeping.  But how does a specific private key associate with a specific public address, and how does the private key successfully release the bitcoin if there's no central authority saying, \"Yup, that's the right key, process the transaction.\"  \n\n**TL;DR:  How does the private key certify a transaction as legitimate in a public ledger while also being private from the public ledger?  It seems like a paradox.**",

            "Text": "Maybe this has been discussed many times already but I still don't get the point: Given the idea that BTC should work as a currency, why do some of you want it to gain incredible value in very short time, and why do you think it's necessary to hold lots of BTC forever? To me, this seems to be not only two different targets, but also contradictory ones. In the fiat world, you would use a currency with a very precise gut feeling about its value looking at the goods you can buy for it, and you have lots of sources of information to see its (necessarily rather stable) precise value when comparing to other currencies. You would hold it only for the reason of being able to pay something immediately, and to keep your fortune when there is no better option at the moment. Whereas, when you want something which gains value over time, you would use shares, or houses, or rare old cars. Since I appreciate so much the underlying technology of BTC, it would be worth to see it really adopted by the public but it won't, given an average value change of 20 percent per day!\n\nI understand that one of the essential targets of BTC is, that it must never be controlled by any institution. But, and this is what I am really convinced of, you must get rid of the soaring and the crashing, and of the daily 20 percent ups and downs.\n\nThe key question is, wouldn't it be possible to get an algorithmic solution for that stability issue?\n\nThe BTC community obviously has a lot of super brains. After the brilliant idea of implementing the LN, I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this: get the BTC value stabilized by algorithms. Surely it must gain value over time when the community grows, due to the limited amount of bitcoins, but this process must be steady, foreseeable and without surprises. After you have managed that, I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling, and these will then be lots and lots people who are not inside the technology but who are just using it for all the advantages it has. Smartphones are used all the time by billions of people because they are so terribly convenient, but how many of them know all the technology? It doesn't matter to them because it works anyway. I think a technology is mature enough for the really big world when a standard user doesn't need to know anymore how it works. The \"user experience\" of using BTC for payment must just \"it's working always and everywhere\", and the next key success factor is a very reliable stability of its value. \n\nUnless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks. Of course the winners of this game will be at least millionaires at the end, but millionaires in fiat money, and this still ongoing gambling game will not cause any progress on the original idea of crypto currency.\n",

Especially as it becomes increasingly finite? \n\nBecause Bitcoin has wider adoption by general users than Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. And because it has lasting \"brand recognition\" I think that it will still be in the top 3 in ten years.\n\n",

So after you see 3 or 4 consecutive rallies you will buy back in. At that moment, you lost maybe 10% of your BTC. So you will try to hold now for another 10% up. Maybe you see it going up a little more, maybe not, but then it will start a sharp decline down below your buy-back point. You will have bought the top. It will then continue to fall below your original sell price, leaving you in a state of despair. You won't be able to think rationally and perhaps sell the bottom once again.",

They get so angry that the price hasn\u2019t crashed that some have convinced themselves that whales are artificially propping up he price.  I also see some of them come over here and tell everyone to sell because the market is crashing- hoping to incite fear and panic. It\u2019s crazy.  Bottom line, nobody knows what the price of bitcoin is going to be in the short term.  Unless you are a skeptic (and somehow think the price is going to 0), the best advice for a lay person is to Hodl.  The price will rise more than it will fall, so the odds aren\u2019t in your favor if you sell.  Just my opinion.",

This is secure because of the underlying mathematics being irreversible, i.e. multiplying to large integer numbers is trivial, but finding which two integers were multiplied to get a particular product is absurdly difficult.\n\n",

I took (2) different 5-10% losses.... but it saved me from a 35-40% fall... so while my USD was smaller, my buy back in was for a larger portion of BTC... meaning my upside was greater than simply holding.\n\nI get the part about locking in losses.  nobody wants to do that.  but the other part is locking in your time (as you wait to crawl out of the grave).  and another part is locking in your lack of liquidity, which in turn, locks you out of future opportunity... again, all as you wait to simply crawl out of the grave.\n\nThe only good thing about this casino is that the tide goes in and out every week... so the time cost (in many cases) is just a week... but it can be horrendous... think folks who bought AND held after buying BTC at the ATH.  They are going to be waiting a long time.  And feeling like shit each day of that wait.  I strongly suspect nobody who bought AND held at the ATH would do so again.",

When I buy at the bottom I end up with more BTC in my control every time and if the price is trending upward, that means I get more BTC without ever having to enter more of my fiat into the system. It's working out really well and I gotten more this way than I could afford to buy.",

            "Text": "Correct me if I'm wrong anyone. \n\nAssuming you're referring to bitcoin nodes and Lightning network channels- \n\nA bitcoin node (usually referred to as full node) is sort of like a server you are running where you have already downloaded the full blockchain, as in every single block containing transactions since bitcoin started and checked it's integrity agaisnt multiple other nodes. Thus you have a complete copy of Bitcoins history, and each time miners generate a new block of transactions and wallet balances change, your node and everyone elses add that new block. If someone tries to \"cheat\" and spend bitcoin that they don't have, a check will be done against nodes to see whether that address has any bitcoin or not. \n\nLightning network channels- \nThese are used to perform transactions off-chain. Meaning if you don't want to wait for the next block time (up to 10min) or longer for lowest fees, or if you plan to do many small transactions and so don't want to pay fees for each, you can connect to a network of lightning nodes that lets you instantly send or receive bitcoins- when one of you closes the channel, a balance change is commited to the bitcoin blockchain as a transaction. If all nodes have 2+ channels open and avoid centralizing around specific nodes, you should be able to transact instantly to anyone on the lightning network by going from peer to peer, alternatviely you can connect a channel directly and do it manually. \n\nLightning network greatly offloads the bitcoin blockchain by reducing amount of transactions on the chain while still allowing a growing adoption and faster transaction-time.

It can be 15 - 20 dollars from market price, turning a profitable sell into a loss. After I lost $20 bucks on a supposedly profitable transaction, I switched.\n\nBut it does buys and sells through gdax. I think that's hand-waved away with slippage and fees, but it's super weird to say sell and see that you weren't even close to market price or the spread line in the book. ",

            "Text": "There is a thing called \"difficulty adjustment\", which is built-in to the Bitcoin protocol. It makes mining more difficult as more hashrate comes online, to prevent it from being too easy (profitable) to mine  a block. However, I think it adjusts every few weeks, so while $5k might be a near-term floor for profitability, the floor would drop as hashrate goes offline.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin can absolutely go down to any value and regardless of the profitability of mining. It just means that below a certain point the network stops working.",

I also believe Trump's steel tariffs are not about jobs but about having enough production in house to support our military in a war. I think Putin is getting ready to move against the rest of the Ukraine. Plus Russia has already positioned itself so they are one of the top suppliers of energy to the EU.  Think about some of the anti-Russian news we are being fed: 1) they interfered in our elections, 2) they took over Crimea, 3) they used nerve agent in the UK and then warned the UK not to mess with a nuclear power, 4) they threatened to attack US forces in Syria, 5) they are working to get rid of the petrodollar (and are accumulating more gold than ever) and today the news is that 6) they are attacking our power grid.  Of course, Trump needs wartime consiglieres and he already picked Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson.  If he chooses John Bolton as the national security adviser, I will be convinced that war is inevitable.",

It\u2019s easy to predict long term trends (it will go up) but short term fluctuations are pretty much impossible to predict. It\u2019s the same reason why huge supercomputers are used to predict weather but can\u2019t make any reliable predictions past a week or two ahead. However, supercomputers can reliably be used to predict long term climate trends. \n\nThis is all because, in chaotic systems, small immeasurable perturbations can domino into large effects which dominate the system as a whole over the short term or be completely erased by mere random chance conditions. But over the long term, the law of averages applies which makes it much easier. This is why time in the market always beets timing the market.",

We wouldn\u2019t lose all miners because miners in subsidized cost areas like Latin America (Venezuela comes to mind)  could still mine for profit, but the system would certainly slow drastically, and that\u2019s without getting into the impact it would have on speculative trading.",

It's nigh impossible for every single miner & node to quit within our lifetimes.  Someone, somewhere, will still be running a mining node for the next 100\\+ years.  Probably a lot of someones, in fact!\n\nI can't foresee bitcoin ever dipping into single digits ever again.  There will always be many enthusiasts who would happily acquire a handful of BTC for the price of a sandwich, just as a novelty.\n\nConsidering that we still have hundreds of thousands of users still clinging onto IRC channels and other similar old tech, I cannot feasibly see a way for bitcoin to be completely wiped out.\n\nBecause bitcoin is not a company, it cannot go bankrupt or have bad management or issue a controversial statement or have a bad fiscal year.  It is eternal and impartial to the world around it, and evolves on a global standard.  Therefore I think it had potential to *always* remain cyclical, for enthusiasts to get back on board, and re\\-boost its popularity.  Even if there is a spectacular crash, that doesn't make it useless.  Slowly, people will return to using it, and just say they won't make the same investing mistakes again.  Repeat ad infinatum.  Bitcoin will be part of humanity for a long long time.",

            "Text": "Yeah, there is risk. You can mitigate a lot of it though. Stop Orders are you best friend. Use them to know when to sell and when to buy, but don't be greedy with them. I usually set them $300 under what ever the current price is once I've cleared that from my initial buy. Then as the price goes up $100 I change the Sell Stop Order. If it spikes, don't adjust for that. Wait an hour or two and see what it's going to do. Likely it will come back down. You don't want to false trigger a spike unless it's mooning hard. Then get the goods, but when you are out it's hard to know when to buy back in.\n\nUse a Buy Stop Order, but do it the other way around. Set it $300 above the current price. Change the order as the price drops and then when it triggers that's where you are back in. \n\nThis has worked well for me most of the time. Don't let FOMO get the best of you. If you made a plan then stick to it. It's very likely that if you change someting because of FOMO or some other fear or greed it will fuck you.",

I know this because I went back to one of your posts from 7 months ago where someone called you out for being a Redditor for 4 days.  I'd like to know how you went from being an expert on Game of Thrones, which you apparently love commenting on it, to an expert on Bitcoin.  Believe it or not, it is possible to understand the tech while disagreeing with a valuation in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  For me, the fundamentals of Bitcoin are no different than they were two years ago when it was valued at $400.  If anything, the fundamentals are worse with things moving towards regulation.  At this point, I believe understanding technical analysis puts you in a better position to make money than crossing your fingers and HODLing.  But good luck to you.",

My point is that if everyone just held then whats the point of bitcoin besides an insider store of value club. Its meant to be used for trade. It really is the worlds first universal currency.

The thought that bitcoin could make you rich quick. That brought in all that FOMO money from people who had since never heard of bitcoin and didn't understand it. All they knew was that it was shooting up in value and they wanted in. It was the first time that it caught on in the media like that and it fueled that hysteria. \n\nThink of it this way - what did you hear being talked about more last fall; they fact that a select few vendors accepted BTC? Or that the price of Bitcoin was exploding?",
