            "Text": "What I like is we have been \"relatively\" stable for price for the last 4 months... During the last 4 months Bitcoin has had 3,significant price lows, the first low was on Feb 6th.\n\nHeres the good news each low has been higher than the previous low. This wouldn't be so relevant if it was over 21 days, but its been 4 months of a stable price with higher and higher bottoms.\n\nTo be fair I need to add that BTC price highs have been getting lower too over the last 4 months...so higher lows and lower highs...and generally a much more stable price.\n\nAt 4 months the evidence and psychologically around BTC reaching having reached its price bottom is getting stronger by the day.\n\nPeople are feeling more comfortable beginning to accumulate BTC again... Every month in this  price range that passes, looks more and more like 2016....where many people accumulated the entire time.\n\nIts nice to see real signs that we may have bottomed or at least real signs of support getting stronger by the day. \n\nI want the price to moon tomorrow, BUT if I can accumulate for the next few months or even next year will likely be the best scenario that could happen to many of us, who decide to accumulate again.\n\n",

Has this happened already? I bet it's hard to prove\nbut I'm OK with Russia keeping some emergency reserve bitcoin on hand. Same with  countries that don't have sanctions on them now but might have sanctions in a few months  from now, Iran had this happen. \nMaybe stocking up on some BTC is a viable backup option now. \n\nMyself as a Canadian, I can say people here aren't upset with American people at all. But it's the leadership throwing sanctions on us after being ultra close allies, and to be called a threat to our neighbors security after sending troops to Afghanistan and supporting essentially everything the white house asked, people are talking about it all over. \n\nNobody knows who is next in line, for tarrifs or sanctions. So wouldn't it be prudent to have some BTC? \n\nI feel this trade war is getting people thinking of backup plans... \n\nSorry for talking politics. I have family in the US, and great US friends who spend summers in Montreal. The question  is, isnt this exactly one of the reasons Bitcoin exists? Monetary sovereignty \n\n",
