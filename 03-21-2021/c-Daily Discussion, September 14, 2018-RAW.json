            "Text": "Just suppose...\n\nWhat if bitcoin seems to average about 7500 USD or so over a very long period, like a year or even more.  Currently, this isn't high enough of a value in USD to really mine anymore with GPU's, if mining for profit in USD anyways.  I do not mine with ASIC miners and I really know very little about them, even though I almost bought a Bitmain Antiminer S9 before I build my 8 GPU rig.\n\nWill mining taper off to little to nothing, will difficulty levels be adjusted to compensate miners, or what else?\n\nI would be interested to know some thinking on this, should it become a reality or even close to a reality for some length of time.",

Yes, Bitcoin is much more than payment processing. It is also a very important store of value, a monetary unit not controlled by any government. The Bitcoin network is also the first working proof of decentralized cooperation and consensus among adversarial parties, aka Nakamoto Consensus. This could have many implications over time.\n3. You can include small amounts of arbitrary data in every transaction and block. For example, miners can \"sign their name\" on a block they create, and/or include a brief political statement such as \"NO2X\". Something else you can do is include a hash of something, for example the hash of a statement or contact. This hash can then be referenced later as proof that the given statement/contract existed at the time it was included in a block.",

It killed the old, bloated, corrupt version of it but the music industry still exists. It ignored (first stage), denied (second stage), fought tooth and claw (third stage) and then had to adapt to the disruptive technology or perish (fourth stage). \n\nNow you have streaming, vevo, spotify etc. It will likely go down a similar road with bitcoin (and other cryptos) and the conventional fiat banking system. We are still at ignore stage, pretty much. They don't even deny yet for the most part. In the end, the old fiat banking model will die and adapt but bitcoin/crypto only seems a libertarian dream from our perspective imo.",

When 50s rock came along many people tried to supress it, but the younger generation wanted music they could call their own. One of the strongest arguments to support cryptocurrency is the increased level of adoption we will see when the generation raised in a digital culture come online with investing. Anyone that believes they will choose digging rock out of the ground to stick it back in the ground again ... over the digital option of Bitcoin? That's simply delusional. Bitcoin will win, and crypto will be claimed as the currency of the next generation.\nThe analogy you used above was great. It takes time to replace these things especially something as embedded in our lives as currency.",

Unless you think it\u2019s going to shrivel up and die, it\u2019s going to go through these wrenching bear markets. They might look like things you\u2019ve seen in the past regarding other markets, but unless you think this is going away (in which case, why are you here?j, the above couple of posts are dead-on. Any immature market has gone through periods like this before getting their feet firmly planted on the ground. Some people are suited to sit it out, some aren\u2019t. But dammit, i\u2019ve never seen such a whiny generation! I\u2019m glad I\u2019ll be dead when an entire generation of whiners is in charge of everything!",

It didn't all land in consumer's pockets in the US.\n\n> Have things doubled in price? Have you noticed that your purchasing power is significantly lower now than in 2008? Probably not, because it's not that simple:\"\n\nThat is a very simple article you just linked. It has some charts in it with little to no explanation. Yes, the monetary base has expanded but the debt that would normally be created from it hasn't really shown up which means inflation has stayed low. This can be seen in the general lack of velocity since the expansion began. Financial corporate debt and consumer debt haven't changed significantly in nominal terms since 2008. What debt has been generated is mostly concentrated in the non-financial corporate and government sectors.\n\n> Most importantly: Did you earn all your money in 2008 and keep it under your bed until now? If not, then each year you likely received a pay rise from your employer which *at least* offsets inflation. This means that inflation doesn't really affect you - in fact you probably benefit from it - because inflation encourages investment which means stronger economy, more jobs, etc.\n\nIf you did not receive a pay rise each year, then this sucks - it is tough in the USA for people at the bottom - and maybe there's a rightful place for you here complaining about inflation and speculating on bitcoin. For everyone else (which is the vast majority) inflation is a strawman.\n\nThese two need to be addressed together. There are more people at the bottom than the top in the United States. The simplest way to illustrate this is simply by virtue of the median household income being lower than the average household income. If one looks into income distribution one finds things are heavily weighted towards the two extremes, with a certain thinness in the middle that's growing ever thinner. Income disparity grows worse every year, and this has been the case since the 70's.",

Therefore you could project the long term market cap of Bitcoin to tend towards the observed market cap of gold today (roughly $7 trillion). With this market cap, you divide by the bitcoin supply and you get a figure of around $400k per bitcoin. \n\nThis is just one way to quantify the future value of Bitcoin and I like it because this directly values the store of value usecase that I described to you earlier in another post.
