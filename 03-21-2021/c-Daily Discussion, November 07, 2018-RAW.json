Than he threatened everyone that he has 1 million BTC so they better listen to him. \n\nIt\u2019s the funniest thing to watch. Meanwhile Ver is going into hiding cause his scam is being revealed and he\u2019s going to be questioned. He was smart to pick Japan and get rid of his USA citizenship.  He only goes on \u201ccruises\u201d in international waters where he\u2019s on drugs half the time. Maybe the drugs caught up to him and he wants csw to take over. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s satoshi any more. Only Gavin thinks that who is simple focused on coding. \n\nThey just want to sell more mining equipment. Centralize power. ",

            "Text": "There is this conundrum always raised about people being bullish on bitcoin but not preferring to buy with bitcoin (when fiat is an alternative accepted by seller). I do not see any contradiction though. \n\n Why do I choose to buy bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the most secure deflationary cryptoasset. If I have to park my wealth in some crypto, I am going to do so in the crypto where I have an advantage. I see this only in bitcoin which is the most secure or in M* which is most private. Why should i choose any other crypto to park wealth?\n\nOn the other hand, to spend, I actually prefer to use the weakest currency which I have and which the other party is prepared to accept.\n\nNow it is possible that due to these hard money qualities (But see my last para), eventually sellers may also insist on payment in bitcoin in which case then I will be happy to pay in bitcoin.\n\nSo you see there is no contradiction here in not preferring to pay in bitcoin now yet expecting it to nevertheless get adoption as a payment mechanism gradually and as an alternative asset class much sooner. \n\nAlso realize that when a seller decides which currency to accept, part of their concern is what their suppliers want to be paid in and which currency taxes are denominated in. So there is good reason why adoption in transactions may take a long while. But while this happens, there is no similar impediment to adoption as an alternative asset in which to park wealth.",

Everyone is waiting for bullruns, mass hysteria etc., but it's actually far more healthy if there's a gradual climbing. After the biggest mania in human history and a monstercrash, a sideways movement or gradual climbing is extremely positive. Also, this IS the time to invest. Low volatility, low volume = IDEAL for long time investors. Take advantage of it, cause when there's a short spike again, you might be too late. You look at previous spikes, and you see it goes very quickly up and then crashes. You have almost no time to react properly. Now, you have all the time. ",

You will go nowhere if you try to time the market bottom using the interest indicator. \n\nTake a look at interest indicator in Oct 2013. Did you see any pattern there that told you a huge upswing from $70 to $1200 was coming? But it did come and then ofcourse the trends indicator too shot up to highs.\n\nFloors are set by the holding capacity of few individuals who do not need to search 'bitcoin' on Google.

There are a multitude of variables that influence search trends, but all charts show that with Bitcoin, it's actually price that drives the interest and not the other way around. A rising price leads many new investors to the table. People don't want to miss out on the opportunity and then FOMO kicks in. Likewise, when big players sell off, it triggers a stage of panic selling. \nInterest follows price when referring to Bitcoin. Ask anyone else who works in marketing and based on last year's data, they'll tell you the same.",

People thought middle eastern oil money would poor in. Looking back, maybe a little bit more middle eastern money came in from some private investors, but certainly no huge amounts of oil money, otherwise we would have seen massive price rise. \n\nIt was a period when investors were emotional/sensitive: very scared of bad news and hyper with good news. Every good news caused price rise, every bad news caused a price drop. So, there was huge overreaction. I'm pretty sure, if this announcement was made now, almost nobody would care alot, cause investors are more cynical at the moment. Also, less scared and at the same time less hopeful. ",

Infact there was a bit of turmoil because of a close to flippenning event with Ethereum and then also uncertainty about scaling solutions which then led to a sharp dip in July and then emergence of Bcash. There really was no great hype before August. So that's why I ask why you think the situation today is worse than June 2017. If anything there is vastly better ecosystem, more awareness and a Bitcoin with segwit enabled.",
