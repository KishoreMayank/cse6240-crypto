            "Text": "My theory for the BTC sideways movement of the last two weeks:\n\nObviously a lot of people (traders, recent buyers, and old hodlers), think the BTC price is going lower and want to sell. They have pushed it downward after every recent climb (on Apr 3 and Apr 9).\n\nHowever, the greater force is the new whales that have been eying BTC since it's newsworthy growth last year. It is common sense to say that anyone looking to start investing in BTC for the first time and who has done their risk/reward research has picked a price point at which to buy in. This includes all the new crypto hedge funds. What is unknown is how much new money is coming in and at what price they are looking to buy BTC.\n\nI had previously thought that 1/4 of the ATH price at 5k USD would be the largest support line of new money coming in. But, it's looking like 1/3 of the ATH is more likely, at 6.5k USD. \n\nTo me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which many new whales want to buy in. Consider the quick bounce back during the Feb 5 dip. So why 1/3 of ATH? It is similar to previous BTC major corrections, but it's literally just a mental number that stands out in investors' minds: \"BTC will probably fall to one third of its ATH price during this correction,\" is easy to say, so that's where they plan to buy in.\n\nI don't believe in predicting the future, but as a BTC (longterm) trader, I believe in betting on the future. My bet is that there is potential for a BTC 2018 ATL of 5k USD, but I think this recent bouncing off the 6.5K USD line over the last two weeks is the bottom of the 2018 price correction. A slow and steady bull market could follow.\n\nThis is not financial advice. DYOR. Posting here only to timestamp my estimate.",

Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.\n\nAsset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.\n\n\"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase\" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.\n\nInvsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.\n\nIt remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed \"dozens\" of investigations were underway.\n\nThe other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.\n\nThese factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.\n\nEnneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in \"BTC dominance\" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.\n\nWhile the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.\n\nThe combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.",

Called the [Crypto Trader Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network) (very original, I know..). It has been going well and we're seeing some serious progress/growth. It's similar to the SFWPornNetwork but a lot less rigid, much more informal, and entirely based around creating a resource for traders and bringing together crypto related subreddits. \n\nI am hoping to gain some support from trading communities such as this one. I'm open to any thoughts/ideas/suggestions/requests/criticism, and I would be grateful for any support that can be given.\n\n",

(That\u2019s when people say \u201cthe whales are selling\u201d.)\nIn January is was because China had made Bitcoin totally illegal. And the dip since March it\u2019s because Japan is banning unregulated exchange platforms.\nChina banning Bitcoin is unpreventable.\nFor Japan, I\u2019m not too worried because the government is actually very supportive of Bitcoin. The exchange platforms with licenses are invested by large companies and they are doing well. I believe the buyers (who were kicked out because the exchange platform they were using was banned) will come back to the market sooner or later.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m holding and doing nothing because I\u2019m a optimist and a terrible trader.",

You said it all: these are \"magic\" numbers. If market follows an unpredicted move then everybody will refresh and modify price perception accordingly. Also if you look at previous crashes we can find value from -60% to almost -85% compared to highest point. Different contexts, different price impacts. We still do not know what will be lowest point and we will discover it afterwards. Those who will say \"it told you so\" just happen to have right guess and sometimes did not even invest since they had low trust in their gut feeling. ",

Overall, its safe to say bulls have been struggling to find their feet as indicated by stagnant prices and a narrowing price range.\n\nYet, speculation is doing the rounds that big Wall Street names (such as Soros and Rockefeller) are set to enter the crypto space. If confirmed, the news could ramp up the bull case, as happened with the advent of bitcoin futures soon before bitcoin's December price peak.\n\nHowever, history may be on bitcoin's side as well - an analysis of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows BTC tends to perform well in the second quarter.\n\n",

Which is a slow and long process.\n\nHe can also do 1 of 2 things with them. Keep them and sell for his own profit. In which case he will crash the market unless he goes off chain. Or redistribute some or most back to their original owners in which case it may somewhat crash (bassed on assumption owners will sell )or be a slow bleed as some of the old owners sell and some hold but then will stabilize and head back up. Assuming he doesnt redistribute during a crash or crazy December peak when it can compound, announces his plans clearly, loudly with enough advance notice and  does it over a period of a few months it shouldn't be TO bad.\n\nI doubt he will keep them all. He's already pretty hated and if i were him id be fearing for my safety. Especially if i were keeping them. Best way is to redistribute 3-4x the original value and be like \"yeah i fucked up. But look, you still made 3x roi when every other solid investment in that timeframe made 1-2x im trying to fix it\" that would help ease the sting for most people and still leave him a 10x millionaire.",

Sorry. That's reality.\n\nSecond: **Don't do anything yourself.** Give advice, and let your parents-in-law decide. If you pretend to know what you are doing and lose their money, they won't forgive you easily.\n\nThird: those are your parents-in-law best options:\n\n- hold crypto and hope for better prices. Tell them they might see the value falling even more before a recovery. Tell them they might have to wait for many years before they can get their money back and some profit. Tell them there is a real risk crypto currencies to become worthless and remain worthless while the world moves on.\n\nor:\n\n- sell everything for USD, take the loss and keep the remains.\n\nI know it's not the advice you were looking for. But it's realistic advice.\n",

Everything looks obvious in hindsight.\n\nPeople who bought at ATH thought that it will continue going up.\n\nJust like people buying now, thinking that $6.9k is cheap because it will go back to $19k.\n\nIt might not and the price might sink to $1k.  Then I guess, people in future will be asking \"why did those people buy at $6.9k when it's obvious that it's on a decline\".",

For example from the drop at $19000 I bought on the way down and Im going to sell on the way up. Buy low sell high. 18000 is lower than 19000 and 17000 is lower than 18000. So its not were the price is at its were the price is going. That's why I believe people have weak hands because when the price is going up they buy when in actuality they should be selling. So right now is the time to buy imo and Im not selling anytime soon, at least until the price is above 10k",

It's got huge value. If you hold a dollar all it does is lose value. Lost 90% of it's value since 1950. There's no dividend on it and the interest doesn't even begin to cover the inflationary losses and third party risk if you put it in a bank. So how does a dollar have intrinsic value ? It doesn't. Less than Bitcoin by a mile. Yet you're quite happy to hold dollars right ? ",
