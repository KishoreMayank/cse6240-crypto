Friday could be a big day.  Seems like the dumpers can't even dump on a Sunday with ultra-low volume.  \n\nBut none of that matters in the great scheme of things.  Everybody who knows anything knows that *Bitcoin will win*.  It's just a question of when and how.  If most of us are kind, generous, wise people who will use our power for good, not evil, only then will we know if Bitcoin really fulfilled its mission.  I think we are those people:  the good ones, the idealists, the visionaries, the nerds.",

It will also help drive traffic to my site which is called \"Health, Wealth, & Yourself\" where my main goal is write posts on things I find entertaining and informative to YOU the reader.  I hope you guys can check it out and enjoy some of my content I have posted so far. It would mean a lot to me. If you like it share it with friends on Facebook that would be AWESOME! Anyways, thank you for reading, cheers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out my first week wrap on Bitcoin and tell me what you think! \n\n[https://healthwealthandyourself.com/bitcoin-week-1/](https://healthwealthandyourself.com/bitcoin-week-1/)",

They would need to follow strict guide lines that Bitcoin does not.

It's simple supply and demand.  This is a rare commodity that can't be faked.  It is extremely useful, and more people realize this every day.  Further to that, it was invented in response to the 2008 financial meltdown and won't even begin to show its true utility to the masses until the next financial meltdown, which is just around the corner or perhaps starting now.",

            "Text": "Right. I see.  I think you are asking a general grouo of reddit people for an explanation of decisions made by Bitcoin developers.  But I am not sure.  My understanding (no real hard evidence here) is that the Bitcoin core team mostly thinks larger blocks will be needed eventually, but other technology should come first.  In not sure I agree, and I definitely won't pretend I know their minds.\n\nDeveloping new software takes time.  Especially globally networked and distributed software.  If the world gave up on a technology because it didn't work perfectly within a year, where would we be?  Watch for improvements, progress, and new ideas.  If those stop flowing, that would be bad news indeed.  As long as they are, I am confident in the long game.\n\nAlso, re Satoshi, I think the current devs have a lot more information, experimental results, and just plain thinking time behind their current approach than Satoshi had.  This does not diminish his world changing work.  He is the giant, and current devs are standing on his shoulders.  I think we should be careful to treat the original white paper as infallible. ",
