            "Text": "Hello everyone! I'm rather excited about Bitcoin, blockchains, cryptocurrencies etc. but I've recently heard some criticism that I can't answer myself. Does anyone have answers or relevant links to info that would answer the questions I was asked?\n\n1. Bitcoin is kind of like a pyramid scheme that relies on a greater fool theory, hence all of its value is speculative. Bitcoin is a zero-sum game where someone's gain/win is always someone else\u2019s loss.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater\\_fool\\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory)\n\n2. Governments want to control money, know where it is, who has it, how it\u2019s used etc. they will crush Bitcoin if need to be. Can they really do it, partly, totally? I know it\u2019s decentralized but if no one\u2019s going to use it because of regulation, it\u2019s useless, right?\n\n3. Problem with cryptocurrencies is that new different ones can be created constantly, there could always be a new Facebook-Myspace situation.\n\n4. Bitcoin doesn't have brand value or sentimental value, unlike gold for example. Gold is probably the most well-known brand, it has been known for thousands of years, promoted by royalty for centuries, used as art, it\u2019s also the most valuable medal in all competitive events and what not.\n\n5. Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends or interest. Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value, so what value it actually has? (Besides speculative value). It's only based on the idea that someone else is going to pay even more for it.\n\n6. Blockchain technology is going to change the world much more than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Only blockchain is relevant.\n\n7. \u201cI want official cryptocurrency, not a coin that 50% of it's owned by only a 1000 people.\u201c Central banks will create their own cryptocurrency that can be trusted. Thanks to blockchain technology, the amount of coins would be tracked transparently. Shift to central bank crypto would be done just like countries in Europe did when they shifted to euro. Like Jim Rogers has said \u2018Cryptos Are Smart, But Governments Have The Guns!\n\n\\--\n\nThanks in advance if anyone has any leads to answers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Woah, my post really ruffled the feathers of some people. I understand many of my questions were provocative (like the pyramid scheme part) and perhaps silly, but I meant no harm. However, I got one relevant and constructive comment by the user Hanspanzer, much appreciated. Anyone is welcome to add to his and my comments. Cheers.",

It's in their best interest to draw in as many people as possible if they ever want to diversify out.

If you listen to the guy long enough he says the first step is getting to 5000 and seeing how things react. The low prices are not guaranteed and people have also asked him if he as sold and he will be the first to tell you he has not. Think about that one for a minute.

That's why institutions will buy now cheap, set custody for rich people in place and small retail investors come last. This keeps the rich rich. \n\n**1b** Government can make holding Bitcoin illegal, but can they really stop it if people actually want hard money? no. Can they technically shut it down? definitely not because it has no single point of failure.    \n\n**2** Yes but they are all very low in value. Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized system out there with a first mover advantage on top. We are talking about a lot of wealth here. No one but speculators will prefer a fancy unproven altcoin over Bitcoin.   \n\n**3** Bitcoin has 'brand value' and for the younger generation it has more and more sentimental value. If you dismiss Bitcoin, a digital gold for the digital age, you gotta explain how gold could become what it is today. so this is no argument at all.  \n\n**4** Nothing has intrinsic value. The subjective value for people can have different properties. For now it's a ideological and speculative asset shape shifitng into a store of value and finally into a daily transaction method and unit of account. It depends on what stage we are. Gold was a medium of exchange, now it's degraded to a hedge or respectively to a store of value. The value of Bitcoin for people can be: censorship resistance, decentralization, limited supply, medium of exchange, flexibility, speed, store of value, privacy (has to be improved) you name it.  \n\n**5** Blockchain is a buzzword. Blockchain without Bitcoin or other decentralized cryptographically secured systems is nothing but an Excel sheet.  \n\n**6** Cryptocurrency issued by the state is worthless. Like a said above. Blockchain without a decentralized system is useless. Then we are better off with the current system with the option to use paper money. Bitcoin is a global money standard. Governments can bow to that or get rekt eventually.",

FIAT money I don't trust so I wouldn't hold it more than needed, there I agree.\n\n1b I also think it's unlikely for Bitcoin to crash to zero, since there should always be a group of people that appreciate a decentralized system. Best case scenario, mass adoption.\n\n2 I agree, new altcoins coming to market and beating Bitcoin is a weak argument, it's possible but doesn't happen overnight or surprisingly.\n\n3 The claim that Bitcoin doesn't have any brand value bothered me as well when I heard it and hence wanted  opinions from you people here in /r/bitcoin. I've read loads of news how youth has more trust in Bitcoin than your traditional banking, also Bitcoin ATM's, and vendor acceptance spreading across the world - if that's not brand recognition then what is? And Bitcoin is still young, is it fair to compare it gold in this aspect?\n\n4 'Nothing has intrinsic value' I'm not sure about that but can't really argue against that with my current knowledge.  Isn't gold's use in electronics an intrinsic value? But 100% agree with your list, such as censorship resistance etc.\n\n5 I still have to study more why Blockchain itself isn't enough.\n\n6 But would it really if it was linked to something of value? Nothing relevant to comment here, sorry.",

I have been living in a bubble, being exposed only to positive news about Bitcoin. Recently I stumbled upon some criticism that I thought was reasonable. Forgive me, but I'm not super active here (hell, I just created my account today) so I didn't know all this FUD has already been discussed here. On the other hand, constantly new people join this subreddit and isn't a daily discussion thread just the proper channel for this kind of questions? It's not like I made a new thread for my questions.\n\nI thought at least some people would be interested in these answers and questions, so I'll try to find relevant sources. Still, I appreciate if someone posts actually something relevant.\n\nFor my first question I found a thread where the greater fool theory was discussed:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jbi12/how\\_do\\_we\\_know\\_were\\_not\\_just\\_all\\_victims\\_of\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jbi12/how_do_we_know_were_not_just_all_victims_of_the/)\n\nI'll edit when I find other interesting relevant and constructive essays.\n\nThanks all for constructive feedback, cheers.

You bought them off an early exchange and paid, say, 0,25% fee to transfer it to your bitcoin core wallet. \n\nYou found some site claiming to send you 2 bitcoins back for each bitcoin you send there - seemed fishy, didn't fall for it.\n\nYou found some supposed faucet service claiming to make you rich if you enter email and personal data - seemed fishy, didn't fall for it.\n\nYou saved your privat keys offline and backed them up in multiple versions because you read not your keys not your bitcoins.\n\nPrice fluctuated wildly over the years, some claim this is whale manipulation.

            "Text": "**1a** Gold has other uses but these are miniscule today, also due to its high price. It would be used in way more products if Bitcoin would overtake golds position as uninflatable store of value and free up the gold reserves for actual economical use.  \n\n**1b** I don't think governments will make it illegal. It's very unlikely, at least in democracies. Most countries already gave it the status of privat money and are rather looking for regulations than straight up bans.   \n\n**2** ---  \n\n**3** Bitcoin is still young and still most people at least heard the name. Gold has a very long tradition, but as you might have noticed, the community and promoters are building a bridge by calling it \"digital gold\", so people get immediately into the right mindset.  \n\n**4** You can be sure that value is always subjective. As far as we know the universe doesn't care if you die or not. So even food has no intrinsic value. It has subjective value to living things due to their survival instinct. An apple has value to a human and an elephant, but has it value to a moskito? Does gold have value to an elephant? I don't think so. It's all subjective as strange as it might seem. What people call intrinsic value is the illusion of obejctive value produced by community consenus and the feature of shape shifting like gold has when it's used as money and alternatively as industrial metal.  \n\n**5** Just imagine an table in an Excel sheet. One line is one block of a blockchain. And in every line is a transaction noted. Now you simple keep adding line (blocks) to that table and continue the book keeping. That's it. Without distribution of this ledger and cryptographic security it's worthless.  \n\n**6** yes it's possible to use bitcoin simply as a reserve currency, which is pretty much the same as a gold standard. But don't be fooled, this would be a fragile state as banks and governments will always try to corrupt the system. Not meaning that they are evil, it's just natural egoism.",
