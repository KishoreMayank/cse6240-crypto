            "Text": "General rant about r/Bitcoin...\n\nI am an observer of Bitcoin (OK, digital currencies) from before there *was* Bitcoin (full disclosure: I do not own any Bitcoin). The only cryptos that existed in those days were in academic papers by David Chaum, or centralized schemes like e-gold, GoldMoney, or Liberty Dollar. That was the state of the Universe circa 2006 when interest in developing a new, distributed, digital currency was starting to bubble up from many corners of the Interwebz.\n\nI see a lot of posts on r/Bitcoin along the lines that, \"we (the Bitcoin community) need to do a better job popularizing Bitcoin\"... the implication being that if Bitcoin doesn't get popular, it will fail. This could not be further from the truth. The \"big idea\" behind Bitcoin is that people will naturally migrate to using higher quality money *because it is higher quality*. Fads come and go. Bitcoin is not another Cabbage Patch doll. It's not another Beanie Babies. It's a digital asset that can be instantly and (almost) trustlessly exchanged anywhere in the world, an asset that is not beholden to the policies of any government agency, nor any private entity.\n\nIn this way, Bitcoin really is the digital analogue of gold. Of course, it is not *literally* gold because a solar EMP could break the Bitcoin network but not gold. There are some important differences but the analogy is a good one. The importance of monetary gold & silver is that they are monies that rely on laws that cannot be fiddled by governments nor manipulated by private sharks. The laws of physics are immune to the fads of political movements and the schemes of con-men. Bitcoin is built on a different set of laws -- the mathematics of cryptography, the laws of distributed networks and the laws of human action (self-interested actors involved in peaceful exchange) -- but these laws share the property of the laws of physics that make gold & silver such important monetary goods: they cannot be fiddled by government agencies nor by well-resourced private actors.\n\nI am posting this rant because I feel like venting, not because it can change anything. Some people will go on characterizing Bitcoin as just the latest pump & dump scheme. So be it. But those who are using or HODLing Bitcoin because they believe it is possible for a sub-economy to emerge that is based on sound money should understand that the long-run success of Bitcoin has nothing to do with what is *popular*, any more than the laws of physics have anything to do with what is popular. Short of a solar EMP powerful enough to take down the majority of satellites and all other digital electronics, Bitcoin is going to go on being Bitcoin no matter what anybody thinks about it. *That* is why you should hold Bitcoin. The rest of the BS is just line noise.",

If you define fail as Bitcoin hitting a flat 0, then I would agree with your points.

Once it's gone, it is gone forever since it is not backed by the government or insured by any third party. That alone is just huge, especially if most of your net worth is in Bitcoin. You **need** to be tech savvy to live in a world where Bitcoin is used as the main currency, or you will get exploited or hacked by the numerous cyber thieves out there. To live in a world where Bitcoin is used as the main currency is to live in a constant paranoia state of fear, having to constantly watch out for yourself because no one else can really be trusted with the key(s) to your life savings.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Text": "Bitcoin\u2019s relation to the USD is not really a great metric, is it?  I mean right away you\u2019re framing the discussion in terms of speculation and not utility.  \n  \nIf BTC is to succeed as a currency only one thing matters: **adoption**. How many transactions is the network processing? How viable is it for day-to-day use? It will be a success when there are products **natively priced in btc**. Right now there are no real-world products or services that have a predictable, stable price in BTC.  If that emerges then BTC will be a success.  If there\u2019s a simple, clear, and convincing use case where BTC is better because of practical reasons outside of  \u201cteh evil government fiat\u201d or \u201chodl because you\u2019ll see\u201d. Right now that is sorely missing. \n  \nI think we can consider BTC a failure if \u201creal\u201d transactions decline over an extended period. (I say real because raw transaction numbers are too easily manipulated). It\u2019s a failure if the number of miners declines over an extended period.  If it turns out that it really is mostly used for pump-and-dumps and money laundering. Then it may find it\u2019s niche but it will just be small-time, and there\u2019s no reason for coins to cost more than like, 40 bucks.\n  \nAnd in my opinion it will never succeed as long as we hear stories *every week* of people being swindled due to corruption, collusion, weak passphrases or any other security weakness.  The fact that a) there are no products or services \u201cnatively\u201d traded in BTC and b) there is a VERY LARGE AND SERIOUS RISK that you will lose your coins if you make the tiniest misstep (or even though no fault of your own) makes it hard to recommend.  \n  \nAnd finally  there is still the possibility of a \u201cDAO attack writ large\u201d emerging. A global seismic disruption so severe it fatally damages the world\u2019s trust in the integrity of the whole system. This could be a mining bug, a successful 51% attack, discovery of a way to double-spend, a monstrous botnet attack or even just good old-fashioned market manipulation. Sure the probability is small, but not that small.  I\u2019d say there\u2019s a good 50% chance of a major integrity-test within the next five years. If BTC faces such a test and recovers then it may gain enough trust to succeed.  But having living among tech since the mid-80s, I\u2019m not optimistic.\n",

            "Text": "Those are good reasons for people's concerns and I don't encourage people who don't understand technology to invest in Bitcoin. But the value of gold does not *derive* from its commodity uses. Rather, the value of gold, as a monetary good, derives from its use *as a money*. The same thing is true for Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't *need* to have a commodity use in order to be sound money. Bitcoin is still volatile because it is not as widely used as the major national currencies (though its market cap has peaked out at levels on a par with the money supplies of some smaller nations). It will become less volatile as it becomes more widely used. As for settlement of payments, Bitcoin *is* exclusive (modulo other cryptos) in that it is truly distributed. Visa/MasterCard are 100% plugged into the global financial surveillance system and national governments can freeze assets anywhere in that system at any time. Not so with Bitcoin. It is truly a \"permissionless\" payments settlement layer, something that no bank, credit-card or money transmission service can say.",

Bitcoin cannot claim -- not even the gold market can claim -- to be \"free of manipulation\". Of course it's manipulated, but so is everything else (by your own admission). That means that the manipulation has to be \"spread out\" -- they can only manipulate so many things at once. So, I don't think it matters that cryptos get manipulated, what matters is whether they are structurally immune to funny-business. You can't wish more Bitcoins into existence *no matter how many fiat printing presses you have*. And that's the whole point... that is the criterion for a crypto to be structurally immune to funny-business. Bitcoins will continue to be mined at the scheduled rate well past 2100 and there's not a damn thing that the Fed or the alphabet-soup agencies can do about it.",

Can you make wires with Bitcoin that can conduct electricity efficiently? Can you make jewelery out of Bitcoin? Can you make cups, watches, forks, knives, plates, tables, statues, bracelets, eyeglasse frames out of Bitcoin? Because buddy, you can with Gold.  \n\n\nIf Bitcoin is not adapted as a socially constructed and socially accepted currency and means of exchange value, then it will have no exchange value, because no one will exchange anything for it. That is the definition of exchange value.  \n\n\nJust because a digital asset can be instantly, and trustlessly exchanged anywhere in the world, and is not beholden to any government policy... (but guess what? it kinda is. ALL economic activity touches the political system somehow, even black market trades are defined by their illegality, and in fact the lucrative nature of black market trades COMES from profiting THROUGH the artificial barriers to production and distribution created by interdiction)  \n\n\n...does not mean that you will automatically find people willing to exchange something, or indeed anything at all, for said digital asset.  \n\n\nGold on the other hand... there will always be someone willing to exchange something for Gold. Because Gold is fucking pretty.  \n\n\nSo, to CLARIFY, I am making the assertion that:  \n\n\nBitcoin is not like Gold and can never have guaranteed exchange value because it has no utility value outside of exchange value, therefore it is entirely possible that the exchange value can go to zero (capitulation, non-adoption, no one cares). Gold is not like Bitcoin because it has strong utility values (as a conductor, as a material) that are intrinsically valuable to humans (IT'S PRETTY) and therefore will NEVER lose its exchange value.  \n\n\nPlease tell me how that is wrong.

            "Text": "Institutional investors have more time on their side than I do and back in early November I anticipated a correction, followed by a rally with a second correction below previous lows. I also thought shitcoins would get slaughtered, and still think that will be the case, I have a few that I am fond of because they're not trying to do too much, not trying to be anything but sound money so I'm very bullish onbthem in the long term. Time will tell if all that is correct, I shouldn't try to fit shoehorn the data into my hypothesis but I'm testing it all the same without risking too much.\n\nAny institutional investors seriously interested in long term gains have been strategically accumulating since before the slaughter in November. They have the benefit of volumes and time to ignore the volatility. OTC trading is troublesome because it has little effect on the market price. As far as government endorsed cryptocurrency goes I'm exceedingly skeptical they would approve anything as legal tender that they do not have absolute control over, Trump does not care about freedom so much as he cares about his inability to dictate what the Fed does with the money supply. Otherwise said, he is upset because he doesn't control the money. That does not mean he won't do everything in his power to undermine the Fed but making public declarations of US Goverment support of Bitcoin is improbable. The most probable optimistic outcome is that the people realize that manipulation of the money supply can make or break them and place their exchangeable value in more stable/predictable forms of currency. That doesn't sound like Bitcoin right now, but there is some promise that they may more aggressively diversify into crypto if it proves a resilient asset class.\n\nWe're only.discovering how crypto will perform in a recession so all of this is conjecture, but there's just so much uncertainty and a further correction testing the 3000 limit would feel like a proper bottom to me and increase confidence in resuming buying. Regardless, a lot of sleepy conjecture in a speculative jungle. If I had a crystal ball I'd be rich.",

Of course how popular Bitcoin has to do with its long term validity as a means of exchange value, it has *everything* to do with popularity.  \n\n\nIt's purely faith based, this idea that Bitcoin won't capitulate. Now I'm not prophesizing that Bitcoin will go to zero, but it's also just as irrational to think that Bitcoin is going to the moon within the next five years. It could just end up an extremely volatile, sideways moving asset for decades and eventually no one is going to care about it but a very niche group of fringe crypto speculators and then maybe it will finally capitulate or maybe it will just be the same sideways moving gambling game for the next century. No, even at this point it still isn't zero, but it certainly will not have achieved the vision laid out by Satoshi's original white paper, at least not until it achieves widespread adoption, AKA it *becomes popular*.  \n\n\nEveryone keeps saying that cryptocurrencies are not the same as fiat because there's this mathematical formula that controls the monetary supply of cryptocurrencies. But that's it. That's the only distinguishing thing between crypto and fiat. Ultimately, they are both given value through social construction of a perceived fair rate of exchange between any commodity and the currency in question.  \n\n\nGold, on the other fucking hand, is never, ever, ever going to stop being pretty. We could nuke the entire human race back to the stone age, eliminating all language until we're back to Neanderthal-esque grunts, I'm talking about collapse on another level *beyond* some cosmic radiation frying all our satellites, I'm talking no governments, no social contract at all... and even then, Gold will still have fucking value. Because it's pretty. Gold is not just used as a currency, it is fundamentally a desired and valued commodity with many different kinds of use value.  \n\n\nCrypto is just an agreed upon way of encrypting meaningless data so that we can track who owns said pieces of encrypted meaningless data, because the fact that the data is encrypted means that anyone can reproduce it so it can't be fudged with and fucked with. But if no one gives a shit who owns what bits of encrypted meaningless data (very possible if the encrypted meaningless data is worth jack shit) then... who fucking cares?!?!",

Can you imagine the difference if you had 10x more income?  \n\n\nMy point is, we will not see it coming, because we will not be able to recognize it, until it affects the richest few % of people.",

Studying whales benefits scientific discovery, and so far we barely understand how deep that knowledge goes, or how useful it may be. When facing uncertainty like that, it is best to be conservative. The conservative approach is to preserve species at least until we've learned everything there is to know about whales. The \"libtard\" approach is to assume we already know everything about whales, and that the most useful thing they can provide to us are their corpses.",
