He invested .015 in that coin (which at the time was around $200 with the price of btc much higher).\n\nHe looked and had basically $5 left of his original investment because said coin had died and btc is much lower.  He\u2019s a little down on his luck, so I offer to give him back his original BTC as a friendly gesture\n\nI reimbursed him .018 and he comes to me saying \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you giving me the full $200?\u201d\n\nTrying to nicely find a way to say that\u2019s not my issue and he has his original bitcoin now to do with it what he pleases.\n\nAlso, I work with him, so I have to see him everyday and want to avoid him being snarky because of this.",

Without this feature, why would merchants accept bitcoin over a Stablecoin since it is pegged to what they want anyway. \n\nBitcoin\u2019s main selling point now looks like it capped 21 million coins, deflationary properties. And most of these coins are owned by small minority even worse than the 1% of US dollars. \nHelp me out this downward negative thinking and tell me besides censorship and capped coins, why bitcoin over Stablecoins?",

You co-worker isn't a kid, is he, and would he have shared profits with you?\n\nSecondly, he doesn't believe 1 alt coin = 1 alt coin so why are you hoping he accepts the 1btc = 1btc logic? Is it the case that he was a die hard BTC fan but not an alt coin fan? Sounds like not since he asks you to refer to original fiat amount. \n\nRidiculous situation on several levels.",

This creates quite the drama for the (honest)miner that created the competing block, & whom will (most likely) continue to mine the chain built on her honest block, until she decides to abandon it (else, lost block reward!); at which point, it (block or chain) is an 'orphan' in BTC vernacular.  Meanwhile, other miners will choose which block to build upon, per their own (random) criteria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, the attacker, would need to continue to compete against about half the network until either of:\n\nA. the honest fork is orphaned, or\n\nB. his objective is achieved (e.g., victim has released lambo, and he retained the BTC via the double-spend).\n\nTherefore, yes, it is good practice to wait until x blocks have passed, until releasing the lambo; and calculate x as (Wait\\_X\\_Blocks\\_before\\_releasing\\_lambo\\_to\\_buyer)= ($ value of lambo) / (\\[$ 50% network pwnage\\] + \\[$ to solve a block\\]) ",

Once enough people own it, it will be used to bargain and function properly as currency because there will be enough people wanting to transact with it to create the demand for payment infrastructure that can bring bitcoin currency use mainstream. The odd location accepting bitcoin and the odd person here and there who actually wants to spend it is simply not enough to create the demand. It will all come in time but first we need to progress from speculative asset to value store. Then from value store to currency. For now, it's a speculative investment that more and more players want in on as years go by. We'll get there. Stable coins and security tokens are in a different category. They simply provide another way to transact things that are alreay established. They do not threaten bitcoin.",

But a few months ago someone told me that I had to lay out every transaction made in any exchange from day one of the year 2018. Meaning, every time I bought and sold coins it has to be reported. That\u2019s way too much of a hassle. I thought I could just say how much went in and how much I made/lost by the end of the year.\n\nSo I can just do that and no problems with the IRS?\nPlus, what form do I use to report it? And does it have to be done together with the non-crypto taxes?\n\nOn a side note:\nCan\u2019t believe the moron CEO of amazon cheated on his ex-wife, there goes billions of dollars towards a wife that didn\u2019t contribute anything to the creation of amazon, and all because the retard had to cheat.
