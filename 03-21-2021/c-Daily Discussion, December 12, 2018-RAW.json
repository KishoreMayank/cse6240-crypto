            "Text": "I was reading through a lot of the earlier comments on bitcointalk today. Back when Hal Finney was active. \n\nHe spoke early in 2011 about Forks and these spin-off projects. It's like a forecast of Bitcoin cash before it happened. He said they were destructive for the community and cast a Shadow of Doubt over Bitcoin that could never be removed . if one of those projects were to be successful there would always be doubt. What happens the next time a good marketing team and some money comes around? Post #11 specifically https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10666.msg152988#msg152988\n\nThere was also a lot of talk about General usefulness and getting people to spread the currency around. We need more cheerleaders. we need people who are setting up lightning nodes. Only a tiny fraction of the world's population has ever been exposed to bitcoin. You look at that massive growth that took place from 2011 to 2017. if we want that to continue people have to do their part\n\nIf people just get hung up on the price declines and spiral in pessimism. How the hell do you expect to pull out of this?",

Bitcoin isn't perfect; but the criticism repeated in every rBitcoin thread is not rational criticism of the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin asset, or the Bitcoin ecosystem. They are emotional bits of spam meant to make others emotional and drive discussion off topic.\n\nIts a way to push conversation and sentiment more towards one side. It is similar to political discourse. Most people are relatively centered on any political spectrum ; but the louder and more radical one side is; the more it pushes the center of discussion towards that direction.\n\nIf we can't get the spam and trolling under control the only solution to balance discussion is to flood every medium and outlet with radical discourse from the other side of the spectrum.\n\nBitcoin is far more than the price; but you can't talk about anything; even in the Bitcoin subreddit about anything related to Bitcoin without being hounded by trolls.\n\n\n",

I am aware that its a longterm imvestment especilly with current prices. I used cash app to buy it. My questions are:\n\nAm I wasting my time with cash app? From what I saw it is pretty seamless, user friendly, and receives positive reception.\n\nDo I need to get a hard wallet to make my effort worth it? Is it possible to simply use my phone primarily?\n\nCash app not only charges services fees, they also will send you a tax form to claim gains yoi have made. This seems a bit odd to me; do other services have you claim gains like that?\n\nTheres a user here who Ive seen sharing a website for free mBTC for doing menial tasks like helping asvertisers or doing surveys or things like that. How trustworthy are services like that?",

They get it down to 1k and pump it back up to 4k to make a 400% profit.  \n\nThese russian bots are sneaky too.  The bots say bitcoin has no value, but 10.5 million people will pay $3400 for one bitcoin.  The bots say bitcoin has no use, but businesses around the world will accept it.

            "Text": "Litecoin was created to supplement bitcoin and work together with bitcoin in the same ecosystem. The concept was litecoin is to bitcoin as silver is to gold.\nThere's really very little to criticize about Litecoin. I think it simply got lost in the noise with all these flashy whitepaper alts and ICO's. When the hype was in full swing, litecoin was a very efficient and fast way of converting from one exchange to another, and transfers on the Litecoin network were always dependable.\nOff-chain atomic swaps powered on LN seemed promising but the whole Litepay mess didn't do the coin any favors. If Bitcoin starts to becomes a mass adopted store of value within the next few decades (which I think is inevitable), I still see the litcoin concept working as long as both continue to get upgraded going forward.",

            "Text": "No questions are dumb. Seeking information is always smart. Cash App is ideal for small purchases and in those cases, the ease of use and convenience are well worth it. If you are only buying $100 or less here and there, Cash App is a great choice. As for leaving it on the app, that's a bit subjective. I mean make sure that you log out of the app in case you lose your phone, or someone steals it for sure. Once you've accumulated several hundred or especially thousands of dollars though, I would definitely move the Bitcoin to a cold storage wallet such as the Ledger Nano S. This makes sense because you not only control your own private keys but you also drastically reduce the risk of theft. Now if you plan on spending the Bitcoin for purchases however, then keep it on the cash app!! \n\nThe services such as the one you mentioned are each independently run, and like any service, some may be shady and others legit. Do your own research on each specific service, but don't expect to make much money from these - they most likely pay very low.  ",

Ever live in a country with with high inflation ?  Yes crypto is a nascent market , liquidity is an issue  but that is changing . The market is growing and so Is adoption . Once enough consumers buy in we will reach equilibrium of liquidity and the volatility will be diminished.  And as for transaction speed it is much faster than true settlement time for a current visa transaction. It takes 2 days to settle a visa transaction. Btc 15 min tops and cost you maybe .60.  Last week Binance moved 850 million for less than $ 20 . In the legacy system that would have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars and weeks to settle . The most important thing about btc is that it is censorship resistant . Fiat on the other hand comes with a laundry list of restrictions. ",

Of all the criticism I've heard for bitcoin over the years, the issue of alts, forks and copycats has always been the most lazy critique. These copycats are a byproduct of any successful project or business because there's always going to be efforts to emulate that success. There's nothing to stop you from copying Amazon's business model, or Wallmart's, but will you have the support of buyers, sellers, infrastructure and the brand?\nThe people are what make Bitcoin what it has become. The hash power of thousands of  nodes that comprise the bitcoin network is what gives it value. The ten years of the network successfully running solid as a rock with 99.99% up time, without ever being hacked once gives Bitcoin an incredible head start. With networking, you need a solid  foundation to build upon and that ten years provides the confidence to developers that Bitcoin is not going away. The network value alone is incredible. More and more people are realizing this and there's no stopping what has been set in motion. I do hope you'll look into all this more. You'll understand that a simple whitepaper concept, which is what most alt coins are, has no network and no proven stability. These copycats are literally no threat to Bitcoin.",

I am not saying you are wrong or right, but you are not understanding the concept of hash power and network nodes - and how this transfers to use as a currency. \n\nBitcoin is a ledger, shared among thousands of computers who each have an exact copy of that ledger. The ledger records how many 'placeholders' (Bitcoin) or portion of a placeholder (Satoshi) you changed from one wallet address to another, which are transactions. It's an accounting system, stored on a global database. The math, decentralized tamper proof ledger, global alignment, and redundancy is where the value is. I get your coming at this with MySpace and Yahoo examples, and I have worked in IT and Network Security for almost 20 years, so I have experienced these shifts first hand. Bitcoin is NOTHING like those examples. Consider for example, the Lindy effect. Technology comes in many forms, and the Bitcoin network is in no danger of being replaced by a 'Bitcoin 2.0' until long after you and I are dead and gone. \n\nThe main take away I'd like for you to grasp, is that it does not matter how many forks or copycats are created, because they would have to get thousands of miners worldwide to jump in the game, build a brand and eventually be considered as a stable network to hold wealth and desired by people all over the globe. A Bloomberg analyst recently put it best - the additional coins are competition, but will eventually be purged and this will strengthen Bitcoin in the long run as those multiple low priced coins see the money flow back into BTC.",

            "Text": "It is actually unbreakable.  By anyone with current technology.  There is some thought that as Quantum computing develops, there is some possibility that the cryptographic functions can be reversed.  \n\nThere are mathematic proofs that encryption can be done in such a way as to be fundamentally uncrackable.  John Nash, the famous mathematician did those proofs.  He is the anti-Turing, the man who decoded the Nazi cyphers.  \n\nSo, you can be skeptical, but the math is very real.  Unbreakable.\n\nBitcoin private keys are 256 bits in length, a huge number.  These use a one to one, irreversible hashing function to create a public address.  If I send funds to your public address, only you can spend them as long as you are the only one who knows your private keys.  \n\nThe unit used as the accounting notion, ie the money, is called a bitcoin.  Software used to manage these things is called a wallet.   \n\nThere is a transaction record kept of all transactions.  This is called the blockchain.  This record is kept sound because the system is an open network that can not be cheated. Through these techniques, Bitcoin has solved the primary problem of money, the double spend problem.  Government money solves this problem through heavy handed regulation.  Bitcoin is far far far more elegant and perfect than bank money.  \n\nThis is all a simplification.  You need to research some of these terms.  \n\nBitcoin's cryptographics have never been hacked.  The transaction record is 100.0000% perfect.  \n\n",

            "Text": "Money has always been what people agree is money.  The many examples are fascinating. The closest analogs to Bitcoin are gold and the money of the Isles of Yap, which use immobile boulders and stories so that ownership is known by the story of who passed it along.\n\nBitcoin is money if enough people think it is.  At the current price there are millions of people who think so. It has the best properties of money ever used, it is only not culturally accepted very much.  \n\nA \"perfect password\" keeps people from accessing your Bitcoins.  Not just government, but thieves.  There are lots of uses for Bitcoin.  Hiding Bitcoin from the government of Venezuela is helping thousands from literally starving to death.  \n\nThe entire foundational premise of Bitcoin is that it can not be interfered with.  That has held true.  Bitcoin is still too tiny for government to be worried about.  \n\nOnly a highly authoritarian government would even attempt to outlaw it. Bitcoin is software and messages which are impossible to interfere with both practically and legally.\n\nAnonymity is a different matter.  Bitcoin is anonymous but it can be correlated to diminish the anonymity.  \n\nOther coins, particularly Monero, are very anonymous.  \n\n\n\n",

If there is a fundamental reason to point at the decline it's definitely bcash.\n\nBitcoin cash keeps trying to challenge the stability of Bitcoin and they have been pretty successful in bringing the price of everything down. Doubt. Fud. The realization that if they were to ever succeed it would compromise the entire project. People would always be wondering when the next chain was going to come about",
