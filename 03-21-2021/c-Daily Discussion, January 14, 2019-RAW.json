There will never be a shortage of innovative developers who want to improve it and be a part of the bitcoin evolution process. There will never be a shortage of participants who want to buy bitcoin low and sell it high. There will never be a shortage of people who support the decentralized dream. The world will never stop becoming more digital oriented as it moves further away from traditional mediums. Bitcoin is here to stay and so is the crypto ecosystem in general. Like it hate it, this is what it is.",

How it works is that through advertising (which bitcoin has none) or word of mouth (pyramid scheme), you are trying to get people to buy something with no value, thereby giving it a value. The more people you can swindle to buy, the more your bitcoin goes up. If you are the early person, you are at the top of the pyramid. If you heard about it in the middle, you would buy in the middle causing it to go up, making money for the guy at the top of the pyramid. Now, you and the other guy have to get noobs to buy in becoming the new bottom, raising the pyramid even higher by having the price go up. IE Popularity Contests are basically pyramid schemes.",

Probably. It's an old technology and very unpractical. It might survive as a collector's item, and then it won't be that big, or maybe because of being a collector's item, the price will rise. But it's not suited for mass adoption, and that's just it. Technology will evolve and btc might become something from the past. The first one, a special one, but not necessarely the one that will be used by societies. It's really not a big deal and nothing to be emotional about, except that alot of people could lose alot of money. But besides that, it's not a big deal. Many things that were a success once, aren't used anymore. Altavista, the old Atari, etc.",

So there remained huge potential for hype generation, which occurred in 2017 and resulted in the bubble we all rode up. The market is mature now and another hype wave is far less likely. If you were a Mum/Dad investor or a finance manager would you really be buying into btc after watching this crash knowing it has literally no use case and is driven by pure speculation or would you put it somewhere safer? Instead of calling me uninformed and under-read because I doubt another ATH is possible maybe you should try to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results and actually think about the situation rather than just crossing your fingers.

Bitcoin is already the best use of blockchain and this opinion is shared by the best and brightest developers in the field. It doesn't need do anything else outside of what it already does, it  just needs to be developed further for capacity and that will be implemented via layering and side chains, etc. Bitcoin is NOTHING like Altavista or the old Atari.

The internet is a communication tool ...sort of. It's actually much more but anyway. Bitcoin is a currency, store of value and investment asset so far...it may even go on to serve more purposes.\nBut they are both first mover NETWORKs. You don't replace networks, you improve them via upgrades and replace the hardware that runs on them.\n\nDon't worry, time will tell all and you can discuss this with me then... if you are still here to admit you're wrong that is.

If we can get enough of the popular kids to talk about bitcoin, then the rest of the world wants to buy some too, making it cool. That's how ToysRUs made millions on Cabbage Patch Kids, becuause a few key people said Cabbage Patch were cool, and there was a run on them, making them sell for like $20,000 each. Same with bitcoin. It's an exercise in popularity to get people to believe that some computer thing that is invisible, has any sort of value. It's a giant game of trust. It's like, say you want to buy drugs on silk road, and the dealer only accepts peanut shells because he can trade peanut shells with his dealer, so it moves peanut shells around as currency. So you go buy peanut shells, give them to the dealer, he buys from his dealer, and everyone is happy. Same with bitcoin. It's completely worthless unless you can convince the dealer to use bitcoin. If he uses LiteCoin and you only have Bitcoin, you are basically wasting your time. This is why this is a bit of some bullshit. The ONLY thing bitcoin OWNERS want is for MORE PEOPLE to buy bitcoin. That's it. That's how they make money. The steps to get more people to buy include things like adoption and so they push adoption because if more people believe it has value then like peanut shells, it has value.",

            "Text": "Timeline doesn't matter, but let's say 2018 just to keep it simple. If you look at the market volume for BTC, millions of people invested in Bitcoin at prices > $3600. Only a relatively small number of people bought BTC sub $3600. Millions of people lost money, and a few early adopters got very rich.\n\nAgain, this is the point that I'm making, Crypto burned the \"early majority\" and they probably won't come back. Saying they'll be back because the \"early adopters\" got rich doesn't make sense.",

            "Text": "With this space, anything is possible. You just need to consider where I've been coming from on this. It's been many years and several close friends who got me into it were mining bitcoin on home PCs back in the day. I'm very much in reality I assure you :). Bitcoin does not have to replace fiat or the current system. \n\nDo I think that one day it may function as an alternative currency for a digital society? Yes, but first it needs to complete market saturation and then consolidate as a value store. That's where most of the guys deep into this see it headed first. Do I think it will be replaced? Hell no. It took ten years to just build  foundation to layer on. I've worked in the networking security field for years, and I can tell you - you don't replace networks, you upgrade them and replace the hardware. Bitcoin does not need anything else other than speed and upgrading. It doesn't need the fancy bells and whistles outlined on these crap whitepaper ICO's generated only to turn a profit. They barely have a functioning network yet! You can't believe that Lightning Network is the last update to Bitcoin do you? It's one of many many upgrades bitcoin will see over the next few decades. Devs are working this constantly and the Bitcoin dev team has grown much bigger over the past year.",

I've been in it for 2 years and setting up wallets, tansferring money etc is far too complicated. Try telling a 50 year old about wallet security and that no one guarentees their value if you make a single mistake. It's unusable in it's current form so this dev team has an unspeakable amount of work ahead of them. They need exposure and names people trust to market this to the common person. So much needs to happen, we're looking at a 10 year timeline. So much can happen in that time, I just don't think btc will survive. As for price, I think we're going a whole lot lower. 1k, maybe less. Then the only news people will see if how btc is a failed experiment. It's hard to come back from that. I want to believe though, so let's wait and see. ",

            "Text": "Many innovations over the years have been mass adopted for a completely different purpose from what they were initially created to fulfill. We see this all the time. Bitcoin has a much better use case as an investment asset and store of value. Once the price settles after market saturation has been maxed out, only then can we truly see payment infrastructure that will support user friendly transactions. This is literally generations away, and the Bitcoin of tomorrow would have to look much different than today. Bitcoin already functions as an investment asset and hedge. I only have about 5% of my investments in bitcoin, but I have really enjoyed including it in my portfolio. The journey has been a fun ride. I think people need to stop thinking about the currency use case and let it all play out organically as it is doing. The average senior (not 50 year old as you implied - many of them are very in touch with tech as they were raised during the times when you needed to actually configure your computer) won't be around to see Bitcoin as a mainstream currency. People laugh when I say we are in early days, but they have no comprehension of how long these things take. I was creating batch files long before dial-up internet advanced to high bandwidth, and I am floored by how little people understand about the time lines involved. They think implementing a new currency is like upgrading an iPad lol.",
