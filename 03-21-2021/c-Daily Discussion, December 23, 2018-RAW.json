The early indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, needed confirmation in the form of a positive follow-through.\n\nAlongside BTC\u2019s $600 rally, the cryptocurrency closed above $4,000 yesterday confirming the bullish reversal on the 3-day chart.\n\nBTC, therefore, could rise to next major resistance of $4,400 in the near-term.\n\nAs of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $4,000 on Bitstamp, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConfirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change can be seen on the 3-day chart above,\u00a0where the last candle has ended\u00a0well above $3,590 \u2013 the high of Monday\u2019s outside reversal candle.\n\nAdding credence to that positive trend change is BTC\u2019s move above the 10-candle exponential moving average (EMA) yesterday.\n\nFurther, the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into undersold territory, validating a bullish divergence created on Dec. 15.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the daily chart, BTC created a \u201cgravestone doji\u201d candle on Wednesday \u2013 widely considered an early sign of bearish reversal. The recovery rally from 15-month lows near $3,100 would likely have ended had BTC closed yesterday below $3,642 (Wednesday\u2019s low).\n\nThe cryptocurrency, however, closed well above $3,924 (high of gravestone doji), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by Tuesday\u2019s convincing close above $3,633.\n\nOther technical studies are also biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north and the 14-day RSI is holding well above 50.00.\n\n**View**\n\n* A bullish reversal is confirmed on the three-day chart.\n* BTC could extend the ongoing rally to $4,400 in the next few days.\n* A daily close below $3,633 would abort the bullish setup, although the probability of a bearish close happening in the near term is low.",

Only adoption can occur when everything tumbles over, which will take quite a while to happen, so don't count on it in the near future. The question is how would governments adapt to the bitcoin problem....they will adapt by purchasing their own limited supply of bitcoin and taxing the lower population (the bottom 99%) with their own coins tied to BTC. Note that most of their bitcoin will probably be stolen by the ones who hold the private keys. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Bitcoin is at a fire sale right now considering the math.

If you hold coins in an exchange, you do not control them at all (and can't even be sure they really exist - see Mt. Gox for an example). encouraging people to withdraw is encouraging them to take control of their own bitcoin. ",

            "Text": "It's a bit more of a fraud. A lot of us would not have a problem with Bitcoin cash if they marketed it independently. They were not hostile. Basically behaved like decent people. What we have is them using a subreddit with the btc ticker. Roger using bitcoin.com to push his own creation. All kinds of narrative trying to convince people their Fork is the actual Bitcoin. It's all very very dishonest. That's the real problem.\n\nThere is really no one else or no other coin in cryptocurrency I can think of that is attempting a hostile takeover of Bitcoin. The really sad part about all of the people behind it is they have been trying this for over a year and they keep slipping month by month. ",
