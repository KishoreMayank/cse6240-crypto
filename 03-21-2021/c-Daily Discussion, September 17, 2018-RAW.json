The blockchain it rides upon is something very good and very useful as it provides a medium of safety, security, and even honesty in it's openness to the the world, yet it's security virtually unbreakable because of its openness to all.  I would like to see a way for cryptocurrency to be more than a way to gamble away real dollars for a chance to make more real dollars using bitcoin as the gambling chip it is today.  I think it is much more valuable to the world then that, if somehow we could understand a way for it rise above this virtual token gambling chip.",

Eventually the upward pressure will overwhelm these dumps. I don't want this to happen too soon as I want to accumulate for a while. If it shoots up now sure I make money but not as much as I would if it stays low for a while and then shoots up. With limited supply, upward movement is inevitable at some point. Exactly the same mechanics which drove the recovery from the 90% and 85% falls in 2011 and 2014.\n\nThe way to beat this seemingly frustrating period at its own game is to DCA.",

For years I maintained a completely uninformed opinion of bitcoin based in part on my reading of John Kenneth Galbraith\u2019s \u201cShort History of Financial Euphoria\u201d (which I highly recommend). But after taking the time to learn what this actually IS, I am convinced that this is an absolutely fucking world changing technology. There is a \u201cthere\u201d there. This is real. Bitcoin is not tulips. This is the beginning of phase II of the Information Age. At this point I think you either get it or you don\u2019t. All I suggest is invest some time to really understand the technology. If not because you\u2019re investing, do it because it is literally changing everything before our eyes. ",

However those who did and bought bitcoin then are some of the strongest believers in crypto and to think that these guys will bulk offload their purchases is fallacy. They are what a majority of newbies on this board are not. Informed buyers who went out of the comfort zone and bought something in early days that wasn't spoken off much at all in common circles like today. They are the opposite of what we call 'weak hands '.",

            "Text": "When Mt. Gox crashed the price was around 1000 dollars, right now anyone getting their coins back from Mt. Gox has made a hypothetical 6x their original investment when they finally get their money. If you made 6x your money right now would you take profits or let it sit and be paranoid you would lose that money again. Most likely you would take some of that 6x profit. This means that there is now a flood of supply trying its best to get as close to what the price is right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, as a buyer, knowing that those people taking profits originally bought in at 1000, do you think it is fair for those people to ask to sell for 6k when those coins they are selling originally were worth 1k? Most likely you would answer no, thus you would ask for them to sell for lower since there is a 6x wiggle room in which those people selling would still be making profits and willing to sell at.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone getting their money back from Mt. Gox is totally okay to sell anywhere between 1k and 6k because they would still be profiting off any price in that range. Buyers want the lowest price so they will try and push price to the lowest part of that range: aka 1000 dollars. Will it fall all the way to 1k, most likely no because sellers will put pressure on a specific resistance level (maybe all Mt. Gox people really want to make sure they get at least 2x profits and no one goes lower etc.)",
