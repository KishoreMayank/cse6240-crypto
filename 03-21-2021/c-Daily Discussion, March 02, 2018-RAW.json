This may or may not be indicative of an emerging bull market. I am finally feeling positive about Bitcoin again.\n\nI have one nagging feeling in the back of my mind though. I believe that Bitcoin should have crashed a bit harder. Maybe to $3-$4k. Perhaps it will crash again once it reaches $16-$17k to feed my prophet-like whims.\n\nAnother thing I may not be factoring in completely is just the sheer scope of a global \"commodity\". In the stock market they Issue American depository receipts over-the-counter to represent shares of a foreign company; unless you deal with an international broker to get shares directly. The instant pump of 100's of countries converting fiat into Bitcoin could be a beast I am not equipped to wrap my head around.\n\nAll this to say that I'm feeling bullish about Bitcoin!",

You now have 0.09 BTC for $2000.\n\nWhat can happen?\n\n1) It goes up from 10000, and never ever goes down again. So your break even price would be 2000/.09 = 22.222. A new ATH just to break even. But hey, if you are going to hodl, it's because you believe it will go 50000 anyway. Ok, at 50k you'd have 4500 for .09 (plus 1600 you get now) and 12500 for .25. Big difference.\n\n2) It goes down to let's say 6000. To buy back your .16 you have to spend 6000*.16 = 960. Now you have .25 for $2960. Your new break even price is 11840. Or you buy for the whole 1600, then you have .09 + 1600/6000 = 0.356. At 50k, that's $17800.\n\nSo sell or hold? Well it's like in that movie with Schwarzenegger: Do you feel lucky, punk?\n",

You just buy a single one for $80 and boom, the last sale was super high so that's the \"price\" on that exchange, and since that exchange is 90% of the volume total, it averages out to the \"price\" on CMC.\n\nIf you look on that exchanges page for that coin, you can scroll down the trade history and see someone bought a single one for 0.1 and another for 0.8, but every other sale is around 0.0004\n\nSo that's what happened, and it's already over... the price is back down.",

Exponential growth is unsustainable, and eventually collapses. \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nHere, if everyone just hodls and causes artificial value growth, it will create a bubble. The flow of money might seem the same as a pyramid scheme, but here, people know what they are buying and selling, and willing to accept the risks involved. And in a bubble, the first sellers win, and hodors tends to be the losers. It's the typical stages of a bubble, hodors think the price is going to keep going up, so they keep hodling even after the bubble bursts. \n\nSo in the end, hodors tends to be the ones that lose money in a bubble situation, which is the one you're explaining. But if the price is going up because it truly becomes more valuable, instead of artificial value created by hodling, then the hodors will win in this situation.",

The next is $13k by mid-March. Gut feeling is if these happen we could see it over $24k this summer and hit $47k by year end. If that is the case I would look for a dip before $12k so you can enjoy the gains. My guess is based on how long it takes to double in price since the last time it doubled. Average is 158 days looking at data back to 2010. Not sure if that trend will stay intact but hoping it does.",

You make way more bitcoin by selling high and then buying back in far under where you sold. So rather than spending money on the dips, you are using your own money to buy the dips getting paid more in fiat when you sell high and then getting more in bitcoin when you buy low. I don't think hodling is going to work out as well this time around. I think it's way more healthy for the market if people are playing the market.",

People who want BTC to be useful need to understand that instead of creating and insisting on a narrative that is consistent with their fantasies but totally detached from reality.\n\n\nIf you look at Dec 2017 and now, clearly there is less wanting of BTC.    That will be the general trend, so, apart from general day trading with smaller and smaller sums, I'd encourage people to get out while the going's still good.   No need to the last fool standing.",

Who is paying you to do that?\n I believe at this point Bitcoin is in very early adoption phase, yet it has enough critical mas that it would be hard to stop. I believe that, barring some huge government intervention, banning etc, (and that's unlikely when countries like Japan and Russia are acknowledging it's value) that bitcoin has a very real chance to reach wide adoption and value that is 10-100* current valuation. I think it's worth the risk and I will continue to accumulate Bitcoin. But more importantly I will continue to spread the good word and encourage everyone I know to get involved.

Each one is trying to validate his/her opinion and all parties are trying to justify their point of view. The OP has a choice- follow the point of view that satisfies his/her desires which in return they will defend to justify their position. (That is why we fight on this commentary).  In reality the OP should be suggested about the point that BTC is decentralized and that its holders have a responsibility to do whatever they want with it. Now, that creates a big problem because its then purely based on emotion. The emotion being that you either want it to go up because of your position of where you bought or you want it to go down because of the position you sold. ",
