And the LORD spake, saying, \"First shalt thou put the Bitcorn to Holy Full Node, then shalt thou count to one million, no more, no less. One million shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be one million. One hundred thousand K shalt thou not count, neither count thou two hundred K, excepting that thou then proceed to one million. Five millions is right out.

What makes u think 11.5K is a better investment when u could be owning nearly 2 bitcoins (if you bought when it was at 6-7K). For the record I did HODL even when it was down! ",

It's a very smart thing to do; most people just assume that the earn.com link (or the wallet they use) is \"correct\" without bothering to double-check, which sucks because then they end up overpaying (and ironically encouraging others to do so, by accidentally and unnecessarily dragging up the \"average fee\" figure in the process).\n\nSo, seriously, well done! You're behaving more intelligently than the *vast* majority of people out there... even if it seems like a simple question, it indicates that you're smart enough to ask questions and dig a little deeper into things past the first glance.",

So let's say for arguments sake you originally buy:\n\n2 bitcoins for $100 each (total investment of $200).\n\nThe price of bitcoin then goes up to $300 per coin.  So you now have $600 worth of Bitcoin that you paid $200 for.  $600-$200 = $400 profit.  Great!\n\nNow if you were to take out the $400, you would be selling 1.33 coins and keeping 0.66 coins.  So you now have $400 cash in your hands and 0.66 coins valued at $200.  \n\nNow the price of bitcoin goes up to $400.  You buy back in, but now you can only buy 1 bitcoin since you only have $400.  Therefore your total number of bitcoins is now 1.66 valued at $666 (1.66 * $400).  If you had just held onto the coins and didn't touch anything at all, you would have 2 full coins now worth $800.  So you've lost $133 in value by buying back in.\n\nBasically, if you take profits then great! Enjoy them.  But if you think it's still going to go up, and it does, you can only lose money by buying back in.  If the price goes down, you can then make money by increasing the number of coins you have.",

I think we are in for something though because volatility is increasing therefore volume is increasing and we all know what happens when our volume gets going. I just wish I was super confident in which direction we are going to go. It has been creeping up slightly so I am hoping that people see that, see the volume, and fomo us up to 12k. But I could see it going the opposite way too since the last couple weeks has seemed to lack the strong sentiment and focus from major news outlets. I also watch the stock market and believe that there is a correlation between the market and the crypto world. Confidence is returning after our little stock market dip and if the DOW and S&P have a confident day tomorrow I think that will bleed into the bitcoin world also.",

            "Text": "I bought a ledger nano s.  But I hear trezors are good also.  So basically what you will be doing is putting dollars into coinbase, purchasing btc, sending it to your hardware wallet.  YOU are your bank basically.\n\nKeep in mind that when you have your own wallet (instead of using coinbases), you are trading one risk for another.  You no longer have to worry about coinbase going out of business.  However your new risk is what happens if your house burns down?  So to mitigate this risk, you need to think about how you can protect your wallet..  \n\nOnce you get a hardware wallet, as part of the setup process it will ask you to write down 24 recovery words on a physical piece of paper.    If somebody has these words, they can get access to your crypto(even without your hardware device) so it is important to keep this in a safe place.  Where am I going with this?  Well say your house does burn down along with your 24 words.. if you had left a copy of these words with say your parents, then you'd be able to buy a new hardware wallet, put the 24 words in recovery mode and get access to your crypto.  You may be wondering how your crypto could magically appear in your new hardware wallet..that is beyond the scope of this discussion.  The short answer is that crypto isn't actually stored IN the wallet.  The \"private keys\" to access your crypto are stored in the wallet.  Don't worry too much about that for now.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, you want to store your 24 words in at least 2 places since one of them could be destroyed by a disaster.  Maybe you are super paranoid and want to have 3 or 4 copies in various places.  That is fine too.  Another example would be to store them on a piece of paper in a safety deposit box you can rent from a bank.  Or store them with your grandparents safe or basement or whatever.\n\nIf you are really paranoid and don't trust the people who you give the 24 words to, there are other things you can do to protect them.  Maybe you add another random word somewhere in this list and only you know which word it was.  \n\nHope this gives you some ideas.  Another thing you can google for \"cold storage wallet tutorial\" which is the cheapest option since you don't need to buy a hardware wallet but it is more inconvenient.",
