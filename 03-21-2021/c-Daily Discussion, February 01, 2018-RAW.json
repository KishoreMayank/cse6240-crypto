Get away from the price checking. Go for a run, swim, walk. Talk to a friend you haven't in a while. Go smell a flower. There's more to life then \"sick gains\".

            "Text": "Reasons for this DIP: India & Bitfinx/Tether\n\nDeFUDing India: Initial reports misrepresented what minister of finance said about crypto, claiming it was illegal and would be eliminated. The news spread like a wild fire on twitter. Hours later people translated the actual speech and it turned out to be \"eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in criminal use cases.\" Infact, Indian crypto users got tax notices two weeks ago indicating India's plan to tax and regulate the crypto space.\n\nDeFUDing Tether: There is fear that tether has no usd to back it's 2.3 billion coins in circulation and there is evidence that suggests this may be the case. However there is no way to know anytime soon. All crypto currencies besides tether are essentially not backed by any assets and rely on customer demand to establish a price. Crypto price depends on several factors like useful functionality, popularity and future prospects. Tether is very useful because it allows users to easily transfer fiat (substitute) between exchanges without having to pay for wire transfers and wait several days. It's also very popular because of this. Even if there was no FIAT in the bank (their pre audit in september had nearly half a billion in 3 banks) the crypto market could still valuate tether as worth $1 USD sans fiat and it would be valid under their Terms of Service and not necessarily against the law. Even if some agency was to invalidate tether (would be very hard) it would still not affect the market much because it's less than 1% of the entire market share. Some other things that relieve the FUDs: subpoena against tether came in December following the reported tether hack (as you would expect) not this week as fake news bloomberg reported, Bitfinx/Tether rep actually offered another bloomberg reporter to look at all their accounts in multiple banks if they sign a non disclosure, however the reported declined but reported this fact. Additionally, respected whaleclub.io member claims he has seen proof of Tether's fiat filled bank accounts and invites any non believers to come talk to him in whale club team chat.\n\nBased on the way we stayed at 10k for a long time despite weeks of fud and because of recent Soros revelations of bitcoin being used for government corruption nest eggs I am guessing that BTC will bounce back fairly well after the panic settles a bit.",

I believe it will settle nicely somewhere around the 8k support today with the possibility (at a stretch) of it hitting the mid 7000's before correcting back to somewhere between 9500 and 10100 in the next few days. If it closes beneath 8700 today then 6-5.5k would not be off the cards. As long as we never close beneath 8k (or at least recover the next day) during the falling wedge pattern we should see a bull run fairly soon. Note that i'm trading with USDT on Binance so you might want to account for the current difference between that and USD. Just my opinion though I could be completely wrong.

Ask yourself \"why would they want to buy BTC if the coin is \"cratering\"?\"  If I really need to answer that question then please do not buy into BTC.

Maybe best to sell and buy more a few months from now, the risk is selling and get caught in a bull trap and buying higher even if it falls further. If you bought very low I would say don\u2019t bother trading, if not maybe you should consider protecting yourself, or at least try to. Maybe sell half if you are over exposed and bought more than you should. I sold mine because its a lot of money for me, I will remain focused to buy again in the future. Sorry all",

And especially since we have a lot of inexperienced investors who are underwater. \n\nJust as the price probably overshot a lot when it hit $20K, it can easily undershoot a lot as well. Heck, even if it went down to $5K, Bitcoin would still be up 500% in a year!!! So lots of room to fall further if sentiment doesn't improve. If we hit $5K, then I think we will see a lot of buyers. My bet is that $5K is the lowest it will go.",

You are not giving up anything if you sell now.  You already lost the $20K.  \nYou could sell now...wait until there is a bottom and then buy again.

There is a massive difference between market cap and funds invested into crypto, where that $2.2b is suddenly very relevant. There's a strong case to suggest that tether has been pumping btc for a long time (and driving rebounds off dips) and the reason there's no bounce here is because they've been outed and can't get away with printing a whole heap to rescue the market. I could be wrong, but i feel btc is in for a long slide.",

            "Text": "https://twitter.com/elementus_io/status/959166985950113793\n\nIf BTC were valued purely on the capital that is in the process of being transacted plus the value that is being stored there by folks who don't have a stock broker, savings account or anywhere else similarly liquid to put their wealth then the total cap would probably be ~$90B (a bit more than $6k/BTC). Add a little HODL speculation on top of that and I end up with a stable price in the range of $7-8k/BTC. That seems to match the technical analysis, as well as my rule-of-thumb that humans always use a simple heuristic and (emotionally) respond to changes that cross boundaries in 1/3 increments. There is actually a lot of experimental data which shows that people tend to think of a 1/3 change as a \"meaningful\" change and a 2/3 change as a \"major\" change. I believe that the mainstream users who pumped up the price in the fall are expecting a \"major\" change downward and won't be satisfied it's hit bottom until they see it. This is not investing advice, and you need to do your own research and make up your mind, obviously. That said, we are waiting for some sharp swings int eh $6.5-7k range and a bounce up to $8-8.5k before it drifts a bot lower and then goes horizontal for a few weeks with low volatility and relatively low volume.\n\nNOTE: This is just a guess. Everybody has to have a hypothesis ;-)",

            "Text": "Most traders in banks have access to the bank's customer buy and sell orders. So they have opportunities to create a market (trading the bid ask spread) and they get a sense of the short term market direction from the orders (like looking at buy and sell walls that are reliable/not manipulated). \n\nTechnical analysis is subjective just as you mention - they might think they are using technical analysis but really they are just using their gut.\n\nSupport levels and resistance levels for example. They don't really mean anything other than \"it's unlikely to go above/below X soon but it could\".\n\nIntra day trading patterns do emerge/exist. These are profitable to trade until a black swan event occurs. When betting with the banks money, it's a great way to get paid because 95% of the time it'll work and you'll clip a bonus for risking the bank's money. The 10% of the time it doesn't work it wipes out the majority of your historical earnings. Taleb calls it \"picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\" - don't trip.",

My point was to encourage people not to make decisions based on emotion.  It\u2019s true that \u201csmart people invest in an asset to make money\u201d, but it\u2019s also true that smart people don\u2019t invest in something they don\u2019t understand, and they also don\u2019t speculate with more than they can afford to lose. I also think that the worlds banking infrastructure (and other systems reliant on trust) will be changed by decentralized blockchain technology (not necessarily bitcoin) because it\u2019s very clearly a more efficient way of doing things\u2014just as the internet was a more efficient way of transmitting and sharing information decades ago.",

            "Text": "If today's candlestick closes beneath $8700 then it would break the falling wedges real body to body candlestick support. This doesn't necessarily mean we will see 6-5.5k as it could be a bear trap (so don't panic), however, this would mark the first time since December a candlestick would have closed beneath the support. StochRSI is looking to bottom out soon with RSI also soon to enter oversold conditions on the daily timeframe hence why I think bearish momentum may stall for the time being. I stack my buys at supports, should they break I would then look for confirmation at the next support and buy again. 8500 and then 8000 (50/50 split) would be a good place to buy if your not willing to take the risk of anything lower. At the same time the market could change so take what I say with a huuuugeee grain of salt. If you can't read charts then I would simply buy anything below 8.5k and wait for bitcoin to breakout of the falling wedge.",

Grandmas are using smart phones and credit cards. Also credit cards were scary too but tech adoption happens and 20 years is an ignorant assumption. I don\u2019t pretend to KNOW when crypto will be widely used but in my opinion 20 Years is stupid long for a technology that is already being used as a currency and getting more user friendly by the month.

It's nothing more than people afraid of losing all of their money so they are willing to sell it at a cheaper price.  Then the next guy sells it cheaper still.  Then the next guy....etc...meanwhile there are equal and opposing buyers wiling to buy it at those cheaper prices because they want the BTC.  Then some of those guys know the panic selling is really going to drive the price to really cheap lows.  Just sell what you have buddy.  I'll buy it from you.",

Hopefully the same is true for Bitcoin. If price goes back to $1,000, then all the miners have to move to Venezuela...\n\nhttp://www.bitlex.win/2018/02/mining-margins-and-where-to-make-most.html",

I have a thousand Euro in it and I'd I loose that no problemo bit I'd I have to pay extra....problemo. \nI just use an exchange without all those options, hodling.\n\nI was thinking this also could be because of the new Netflix Bitcoin doc. It's not new but fairly new in some countries. It's about people stealing bitcoins and going to jail for it and basicly in the end the main guy leaves New York saying it is dead in new York. Another person doesn't get a license for his Bitcoin project and you see him pull the Bitcoin stickers from the wall as if it is all over. In another bit it's about silk road and Bitcoin being criminal money. I could understand that people watching that doc thinking; \" well not going near that thing, if America says it's over it must be dead\". I mean if some fake news can create a dip why not a documentary.",

The disruptive nature of the technology on political and financial levels are what made me interested, sure when it gained value lately I was smiling and now that it has lost some of these gains I smile less, but the underlying concepts of this project aren't going away... And we have to deal with speculation just like any new and scarce asset has to, it implies volatility and while on the surface it looks like people will lose confidence because they only look at the price, there will come a time when they'll notice the utility of this (just like it took years for people to see the utility of Internet... it took major developments in terms of hardware and software to accomplish this feat). The unchangeable nature of gold and its limited use cases makes it a rather weak competitor, credit/debit cards provider would have to completely flip the way they are currently making money to survive something like Lightning Network when it reaches their scale... so to me it is only a matter of time.\n\nMaybe I'm too optimistic, and I won't live long enough to see this happen, but the main factor that helps me think this way is that I'm not over exposed and I have alternatives in life, judging by how a lot of people react on forums/social media it seem that I must be in a minority unfortunately... and this somewhat explains the recent correction.",

The cat is out of the bag now and it would take multiple black swan events to irreparably damage it to the point where they would cease to exist.\nOut of all the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin has possibly the largest and strongest dev team. The underlying tech is solid with the shortcomings that it has are addressed with the developmental roadmap.\nJanuary has typically been a rough throughout the years, combined with hitting the (probably inflated) ath in December, FUD from all sides with futures, tether, SK 'banning' trading and others, it's been hard especially for those who got in around November.\nShort term it's hard for me to be positive with the market being bearish for the last month with any recovery being hit by a dip taking us back to where we are ( though if I didn't make idiotic trades in late December I probably would have a different feeling on this) but support has remained around 10k which has been a good sign.\nWhile I won't argue that investing in cryptos is basically gambling (especially some of the altcoins), the price is not randomly generated\n",

It's effectively a drop in supply, and so it would result in a price appreciation. It is true that nobody in the market is willing to pay more than $8800 for a coin right now, but that just demonstrates how fickle and speculative this market is. The price itself is a function of supply among other things, so the fact that it's low also probably indicates that many people are selling right now, which becomes a positive feedback driving the price down even lower.",

Additionally, it\u2019s also not correct that there\u2019s no buyer in the entire world willing to pay $8,800 or more. That\u2019s the exchange price, but people are free to negotiate their own trades at $1 per bitcoin, $10,000 per bitcoin, or whatever.

But the internet itself was on an extremely insane trajectory in terms of users/value being provided.\n\nLet me make an analogy for you when people venturing into new techs. The internet = blockchain; random dot.com websites = cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe blockchain technology is REAL, but the prices of the cryptocurriences ain't realistic at this point. Where is the mass adoption for payments? It is mostly driven by hype and greed. Bunch of shitcoins will disappear just like those shitty websites during the dot.com bust. Bitcoin will probably survive, but not after its price crashes first. It will then take YEARS to recover as the hype dies down because people stop believing in it.",

            "Text": "I see evidence every year of this happening though; I mean that's where the signs actually point if we were to consider this realistically. This year there was massive adoption in Asia, to the point where you can do POC sales in Japan at a lot of big retail outlets. The fact that the transaction fee is simultaneously going down and segwit is up as there is still strong use in 1st world countries somewhere is good mana. It's a significant pace of adoption to the point where there's zero chance the user base will be non existent by the time it's removed/revoked of all its current uses. \n\nPragmatically for me personally, I have to do my taxes and I don't want to claim a gain or a loss and I have faith in the long term (e.g. 2020) in BTC. So it doesn't make sense to pull out and make things complicated when 1) I can't predict what's going to happen to \"time\" the eventual upswing, 2) I have good career opportunities currently and can get significant raises on top of a decent living so using energy for day trading makes no sense and 3)  I plan to continue investing for larger long term gains anyway (lastly fuck the federal reserve, and I'm sure many Bitcoiners are in on that sentiment)",
