I think it would lower the entry level for new people. It's also psychological.\n\nLook at it like this, which is easier to calculate and which sounds better to have?\nYou have 0.000090 BTC or you have 9,000 Satoshis.\nNow try this, how much USD is this if you know that 1 BTC is 11148.64 USD and 1000 Satoshi is 11 cents?\n\nYes, currently a single Satoshi is worth close to nothing in USD, but let's hope BTC price will increase to the point where 1 Satoshi is actually worth something right?\n\nBoth are the same, roughly 1 dollar, but  the Satoshi one sounds more satisfying (round numbers sound and 'feel' better, also it feels like you 'get more') than the BTC amount.\n\nJust the observation of someone new to the cryptocurrency field. Would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.",

So seriously, congrats on your profits!\n\nFor me most of my metals were purchased when BTC was around parity with gold.  I'm ahead on my gold which has moved up around $100/ounce since then.  My BTC has gone up around $10k (nine-fold) over the same time, so the gold feels pretty expensive if I think about it too hard.\n\nSimilarly now my wife and I are building a house I would never have dreamed we would own, paying in full with cash from bitcoin profits.  We are still keeping most of our bitcoin but this seems like an enjoyable way to diversify some.  Still... I can't help but think this house is going to have cost us tens of millions equivalent within a short period of time. ",

Since BTC is a very volatile market, you have people who buy/sell by the hour, days (traders)... and those who are looking at much longer (years).

            "Text": ">**How do I claim my BTCP?** More information will become available as we get closer to the snapshot date. An official dedicated guide will be released. In summary, users will need to export a copy of their private key for the corresponding wallet/wallet addresses that hold their ZCL funds at the time of the snapshot. Users can then take the private key and import it into the Bitcoin Private Electrum wallet once it is released in order to claim their BTCP coins. The same goes for Bitcoin holders. **In case exchange(es) support will be announced, users will not need to do anything. The exchanges will automatically credit your account with BTCP. This may vary, so again, please stay tuned for official news regarding this.",

So you benefit from trading lime that if u can time it well. Thats where most people lose is trying to time markets. Not always losing principal but economic loss of doing something when nothing was done or visa versa. Thats where dollar cost avg trading is beneficial. That might not get you 3k however. If perfect conditions arise you can get 3 or 4k based on your style. However in RL theres risk. Avg costing removes some of that risk.",

It is all warped.  Literally day, after day, it is up $500-800, climbing stairs with no end in sight.\n\nAnyone willing (or with enough self-discipline to hold for more than a week is truly rewarded).  Folks that keep jumping out of the way (anticipating this is really a game of chicken) get to keep a modest return and a huge helping of FOMO (except for it isn't fear of the future) it's YRDMO (you really did miss out... phonetically, and conveniently, sounds like \"your a dumb-o.\")\n\nI'd love to say it will dip, so I could buy more - because conventional investing discipline prohibits me from doing so now - but there is nothing conventional about it.\n\nAs I mentioned, but was a little off, this hit CNBC once it broke 11K... and I really think we are off to the races.  I don't think this isn't going to meaningfully correct until we are at a new ATH.\n\nLiterally, as I was writing this, it is up another $60 - just breaking 11.5K.  Barring some breaking news (like BTC is nothing but monkeys hammering away on a key-board) this shit is going to bring out more Lambo mentions than any of us can take.\n\nI for one want an M5.

Most of his sub-points seem to be arguing that we can't use it to bolster this misguided notion that Bitcoin is \"useless\" and that it's \"dying\" due to people migrating to other coins. At worst, I do agree with him that it can be crude to the point of misleading if we read into it too much. But it has its use.\n\nLike it or not, people still pay attention to it. It's prominently visible on coinmarketcap.com. YES, it's true that it's natural that Bitcoin couldn't hold its 50%+ dominance forever due to soooo many other coins entering the market. YES, it's true that market cap itself tends to be misleading (see Song's XRP example). But at the end of the day, for technical analysis purposes, many including yours truly *still pay attention to it.* It's not the end-all, be-all factor. But just like the current temperature and humidity, I pay attention to it when I want to get an idea of how the weather's going to be today.  \n\nP.S. The dominance % is on the rise. I'd pay attention to other figures such as overall increases in volume both for Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole of course. But if that dominance % hits 40% and starts creeping up to 50%, expect altcoins to get absolutely smashed.",

Yobit and binance trade more coins but i dont like them as much as gdax. I use a few exchanges tho. If you have to withdraw or deposit a lot of usd at once its a bit easier to piece it out between exchanges",

            "Text": "With GDAX, you still have to deal with long bank transfer times, but once your fiat is in your Coinbase fiat wallet you can transfer it to GDAX and trade there for substantially lower fees on market orders and stop losses as well as no fees on limit orders.\n\nIf you do not understand the different types of orders, I suggest checking out [the corresponding lessons on babypips](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/types-of-orders). If you are new to trading I highly recommend going through the entire course, it is for Forex (fiat currency exchange market) but aside from the fact we don't really use pips in crypto, the vast majority of the knowledge is transferable. It is also 100% free.",

If we keep making sweeping speculations based on wishful thinking, it does nothing other than create mirages and crashes and the rest of the world calling it a bubble and ridiculed.\n\nWhat is more realistic is that BTC gets easier to use and accepted as an alternative currency to fiat.  For that to happen, the fiat equivalent of BTC must first be stable.  When that happens, more and more merchants will price their goods and services in BTC (regardless of fiat).  The price of BTC will then appreciate/depreciate in accordance to it's usefulness. ",
