If you have the money to risk and enjoy a change from the slower paced stocks, have fun and enjoy the ride.  \nAnyone on her whining and complaining didn't listen. It's going to be attractive at a low price, and there's no shortage of high risk investors who are willing to put money in the game for the next round. No need for drama, it's the crypto market and this is what it does.",

If someone wants to invest say $100 dollars a paycheck into something that could possibly give them a great return then so be it.  Why waste your time attacking people, putting them down and making comments about the outcome of their investment when you don't really have a clue of what the future will hold.  No one's going to be able to tell me \"I told you so\" because I've invested what I could afford to lose anyway.  So its either going to pay off nicely or I will just be in the same position I've been in any way. Good luck to all!",

And despite things not playing quite in his favor -- the cryptocurrency is currently trading below $3,400 -- he\u2019s sticking to his guns.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fair value, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply, is between $13,800 and $14,800, he said in a note Thursday. His explanation for the divergence include last year\u2019s meteoric rally, a \u201cmeltdown\u201d in the macroeconomic climate and treasury sales during initial coin offerings.\n\n \u201cFair value is significantly higher than the current price of Bitcoin,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.\u201d \n\n \n\nUser adoption and Bitcoin\u2019s acceptance as an asset class are the key factors that will drive it higher beyond 2018. If Bitcoin wallets approach just 7 percent of Visa\u2019s 4.5 billion account holders, fair value would be $150,000 per Bitcoin according to his model, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of people asking us about target prices,\u201d he said, declining to update his year-end forecast.\n\n&#x200B;",

It's estimated that 1500 qubits would be required to break bitcoin cryptography; the big players (IBM, Intel, Google) range between 50-72 qubits at this point, but even at this level, the stability of these computers is highly questionable.\n\nBuilding a printing press is still a far easier option if one's aim is to generate illicit gains from currency (at least for now).",

One of the great things about bitcoin is that its hash power is increased as the machines rumming the mining software are upgraded over time. \n\nOh and also, I'd think we'd have many other security issues if it happened in the way you're implying.",

Buy/average down in a bear market, then sell later during a bull market. Bitcoin isn't going away and it doesn't care what we speculate its price to be. It is still the tech it was when we were trading it at 20k. In fact, it's constantly being developed and will continue to be moving forward so unless you're only focusing on this one past year, what's there to be pessimistic about? I'm pretty optimistic when I get anything at a lower price :).",

It does not need   utilization and adoption  to increase in price because the price has never been based on that - it's been based on buying and selling on the crypto market, and betting on a distant future where Bitcoin becomes more etched into society. Based on how far it's come, from a tiny project to a massive industry of miners, exchanges, apps, investment products, proposed ETF's, bakkt, etc., it would be foolish to think it's just goingto stop because the price on the market is low. If anything, that will eventually lead to more buyers picking up the beat up price.",

Volume, averages etc.\nIt's largely physiology. Nobody knows for sure where the new buyers are comfortable, but because it's a market there's always going to be buyers who want to get in where they feel is the best entry point.

So many of my acquaintances saw the profits I made and wanted in - I told them as I tell everyone, \"you will need a strong stomach for the wild ride, and it is going to go down again at some point, it always does\". But all anyone can see for the first ride is the ups, never the downs. So calling it gold at 20k or garbage at $1 is all perspective. If you're here to play the market, judge the bottom on the knowledge you've accumulated and be smart. Cheap digs about the price high or low is not going to get you anywhere.",
