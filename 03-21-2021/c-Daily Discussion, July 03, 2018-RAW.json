When I went to pick up my order, the cashier was confused why I used [menufy.com](https://menufy.com) instead of grubhub.  I used the moment to expound upon the virtues of bitcoin.  She had heard about bitcoin, but didn't know much about it or how it could be used to buy stuff.  She said she'd check it out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was on a bit of a roll, and also ordered some outdoor furniture from overstock.com with bitcoin.  Only paid a $0.05 mining transaction fee  (similar for the greek food above).  Order was confirmed, no problems.  Waiting for my stuff to arrive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall, once you get used to funding and using a wallet, this stuff is not hard at all.Next step is we need to educate and convince the merchants to sell us stuff at a discount since they don't have to pay the expensive transaction fees that credit card companies charge.",

            "Text": "Bitcoin manipulators fuck u. A year ago I began to be interested in bitcoin, because at that time I wanted to make some money on it. I'm an ordinary schoolboy at that time, from an average family. I accumulated and bought the first 0.3 satoshi at the rate of 3500. I went to trading courses for about 2-3 months. Then the market was easy and it was easy to make money. In December, when the rate jumped to 19,000, I was glad that I could earn about $ 7000 from that $ 1000. I made gifts to my parents and all my relatives. I felt I understand something in this market. But when he fell in the ferrel-March. All earnings merged. I began reading 24/7 about the market and for a month went into study. At the end of March, I started to deal with margin trading again, bought a couple of channel signals. The beginning of getting out of 0.2 bitcoins in 2 months I earned 0.5 from the top. But then because of the fucking manipulators. When the fake news began to appear, the fall began again. Part I paid for my university and just because of many reasons I left my parents. I spent part of the money on daily expenses. But he tried to minimize them because he believed that Bitcoin was the future. Here again this rate fell to 5700. And for 4 transactions I merged the whole dep. Now I need to pay for the university, for many extra lessons, because I'm going to China, for an apartment. But I do not have money even for food. I sold all my things, like a laptop, a watch. Parents do not want to help. I opened 3 deals in long and nothing happened, all because of the news. I do not understand how to continue to live stupidly and thoughts about suicide come more and more often. Fuck this fucking shit and fuck my life ",

            "Text": "We used to have to work and mine gold which costs a lot of money until people excepted it as a medium of exchange. It called Proof of work (POW). Bitcoin is decentralized and bringing back the PoW standard. \n\nCentralized banking has such a monopoly, they gave up the POW standard (Gold back dollars). \n\nNo more. This generation has the highest IQ in history due to having a supercomputer in their hands and any question answered in a minute. No more fake recessions, or wars for the sake of elections. \n\nHumans are evolving exponentially and the 1% centralized banking trick is dead. Don\u2019t invest in those stocks. Short them and you can make a killing. We made a few test shorts of bank linked stocks and bought bitcoin with the proceeds. We are going to short them massively. JP Morgan insiders said through darknet chat rooms that they are all invested in bitcoin and have to use Tor to communicate cause Jamie diamond threatened them if they supported crypto. They are pissed cause his daughter and family own crypto but he won\u2019t let them. \n\nShort all banking. You can\u2019t lose. It\u2019s finally a dying industry. No 8-10 year old who isn\u2019t allowed to open a bank account, is going to switch from bitcoin to banking\u2019s inefficiency. A simple app they used their e tire life to a complicate banking system that tells them they can can\u2019t spend money they earned freely on products they want. Makes no sense and these kids will be the smartest generation the world has ever seen. Banks are in fear and should be. The clock is ticking. A lot of people in the banking system are using Tor to communicate to short JP and buy more crypto. \nThe baby boomers are dying off, the millennials are building the future and kids under 10 today are using this technology. \n\nIt\u2019s the way of evolution. But banks will fight bank so it\u2019s going to have to be revolution. ",

If you're happy with your credit card and fiat currency because you prefer the existing system, or can't see the benefits of a borderless, permissionless, un-censorable, un-taxable, deflationary currency, by all means keep using them. \n\n\n\"If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry.\"\n\n  Satoshi ",

Worse than getting involved in WWI he said which the USA population didn\u2019t want to be involved in but it would make the capitalist a ton of money that they hold to this day. Centralized banking is done. It\u2019s done enough damage. Future generations won\u2019t stand for it after having an alternative in bitcoin. Which is designed to be decentralized. Bcash will be centralized by the miners who like bigger blocks so they have more control.

Saying 1 BTC = 1 BTC means nothing because it goes against what you said before that, about how it's supposed to bring down the central banking system by becoming the new world currency, but all currencies are valued in how much one unit of it can get you. There is literally no purpose to it other than spending it, or holding it hoping it goes up higher so you have more spending power. \n\n1 BTC always being equal to 1 BTC is such a meaningless statement, and is indicative of someone that doesn't understand core concepts of value.

There's also the case of tons of transfers being \"lost\", which triggered all of those consumer complaints to the SEC.\n\nAlso, you'll need to pay a transaction fee to transfer the bitcoin from your wallet to the exchange you're selling on. Right now it's basically free, but in cases where people are actually using bitcoin (like you're describing), I remember some ridiculous $50 transaction fees.",
