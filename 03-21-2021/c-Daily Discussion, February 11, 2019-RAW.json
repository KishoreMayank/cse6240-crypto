I don't know what the hell anyone expects. It's up 300% since just 2 years ago and  only came into inception 10 years ago. How much faster can anyone expect this to grow? Another few years and we're probably even going to see a phase where it starts providing easy to use advantages to the mainstream public and then it's going to move even faster.
