            "Text": "What is going on.\n\nHoping the whales don\u2019t read this especially if I am correct. But, I would analyze the crypto market now still in a massive bear market that will continue to descend to $140 billion something this year barring no major news announcements like an ETF, hard fork, etc. I predict the rock bottom price for BTC to be $4800 to hit between now and end of Jan. 2019. We are not in a flattening period yet but are getting closer (the point where you can buy BTC at rock bottom prices). As the crypto market descends towards $140 bill, Bitcoin dominance will continue to increase as high as 62% of the crypto market which would result in a $4800 price around a total crypto market cap of $140 bill. Until we reach the flattening period, I believe the whales will use this lag time to manipulate the markets through pump and dump, wash-and-repeat in order to accumulate more BTC. Until Bitcoin and the crypto market is revitalized, the whales will create as much FUD and FOMO as possible under the illusion that another big bull run is about to occur. But, I can\u2019t see that happening. THE NEXT BIG BULL RUN WILL LEAD TO BITCOIN SURPASSING $100K and not some fake bull run to $10K, $12K or $17K as we have all witnessed since it hit $20K. So, amidst all this uncertainty, the best thing you can do is HODL and accumulate more Bitcoin. And stop checking the crypto market everyday and every week. Bitcoin will serve you bet if you buy it and then look away for 5 years.",

            "Text": "I appreciate that many people use these charts as a source to paint a picture of the price path... but at this point it's pretty clear that Bitcoin is going to see a huge hike in price over the next few years. Cryptocurrencies are increasing at a rapid rate. I've never seen as much framework and global participation and buzz as we are seeing now. It's clearly only a matter of time before this leads to many more people purchasing crypro. Just wait until the late teens get onboard.\n\nThe coin price always dragged behind the infrastructure anyway. It's also important to realize that the big price swell to almost 20k that happened over a tiny time frame so early in the game HAD to drop back... of course any whales and average Joe's were going to take profits and this simply had to go on for a while. It's common sense. Now we need a price that follows the increasing framework, and the rest will be ...well... new history :).",

I would rather plot is as something like:  \n  \nPrice = $0.00846 * (Year - 2009) ^ 6  \n  \nThis forms a straight line on a log-log chart.  Price still increases massively, but the effect is reduced over time.  $100K around 2024, and $1M around 2031.  With the cyclical nature of price, the milestones will probably be hit earlier than those dates - that's just an average for the price.  Then again, with the increasing rate of technology adoption, who knows - might be way off.",

We got many times to that point now and every time we got big buying support there even when there was strong selling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion there seem to be enough big players who accumulate bitcoins around that price range. Big whales are not interested in the quick buck they are also not interested in pushing the price. They are happy to buy every time the price comes down. So they can get the maximum profit when the next bull runs comes where people FOMO in again.  \n\n\nTLDR: To answer your question is it possible ? Sure the future isn't set in stone.

            "Text": "Although often quoted casually, there is indeed some logic behind the reasoning that a dip is required for the next sustainable rise. It is to do with coins getting distributed into a larger number of independently controlled wallets. This usually happens during big falls when people panic sell or long time hodlers decide to cash out at least partially. Both of these dynamics don't quite play out in a rising market. Once coins change hands and into larger number of hands, the next rally sees lower sell pressure than it would have seen if no such fall had taken place. That's because the coins are now more dispersed with less at stake for average individual hodlers and also new buyers do not have the history of the previous fall's agony so not itching to sell. ",

Look at the number of listening nodes, look at the daily transactions, look even at the numbers of this subreddit lol ... then we have lightning, scaling debate done, next halving to come, bakkt, etf discussions, millenials coming into positions to earn, save and invest ...\n\nAs long as supply is finite and demand constant or growing, price will go up in the long run. How soon or how fast or how high nobody can seriously say. \n\nBut as it is now, these variables are in place. ",

It is a simple mathematical extrapolation model. \n\nOh and my short term prediction was that there would be a price boost upon the lines crossing on the cb pro one day chart.  Upon the crossing, price boosted $400 (5%) over a few days.  Anyone making a short term play would have made some money if they sold in time before the massive sudden whale dump.  I cannot predict when whales will decide to wake up and manipulate the market against its natural trend. \n\n",
