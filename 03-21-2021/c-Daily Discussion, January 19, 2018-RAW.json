If the market had gone over 1 trillion the narrative would have been massively bullish and we would have possibly seen 1.5 within weeks. IMO world leaders were getting nervous. They know they can't stop crypto but they can slow it down. When BTC corrected down to 13500 five days later then started back up again, world leaders made their move. South Korea announced a possible ban and made a big show of raiding exchanges. China made noise about \"cracking down harder.\" IMO, these events were timed to prevent another run-up of the crypto market. Take this with a grain of salt bc I am susceptible to conspiracy theories after 4:20 in the afternoon.",

Just wondering whether the veterans of you can tell what made Bitcoin recover yesterday.\n\nApparently, it initially fell due to FUD because of those regulation announcements. So my expectation was that we need something concrete to happen to make it rise again (some announcement or event). All charts show that those drops apparently happen every January. Therefore, my question is: What made Bitcoin recover in the recent years? Was there a concrete trigger or did it just kind of happen?\n\nWould be really helpful to get a feeling for \"is the worst over?\" or \"what needs to happen to end it?\".\n\nThanks!",

            "Text": "When you look at the chart for an alt coin that has been pumped and dumped it usually has a rapidly occurring high, then a drop, then a second run up that doesn't go quite as high as the first, then a gradual downward trajectory until, if the coin has any value at all and isn't just a shitcoin, it levels off somewhere above the point where the pump and dump started. This higher leveling off could be attributed to higher awareness of the coin brought about by the meteoric rise. Looking at the BTC chart back to November or so it looks the same, like BTC has been pumped and dumped. My casual non expert prediction is that BTC will level off in the 8-10k range then slowly grow, with spikes up or down based on positive or negative events.",

Monero is not compatible with the Lightning Network (lacks script support, has different timelock model, multisig works differently, etc), therefore this question makes little sense today. That being said, the Lightning Network protocol (for Bitcoin) will enable Onion Routing which will help aleviate the IP address concern. Subaddresses should aleviate the concern a\u2026\"\n\n\n",

It seems strange to me that just after the bear trend seems to have reversed (at least for now) all these people suddenly start to talk about the Tether conspiracy. \n\nI\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t think there is any conspiracy here. I think it\u2019s just large players who want to enter the market without the regulatory risks/magnifying glass that comes from using huge amounts of USD. \n\nThe irony is that with fiat currencies and banks no one even questions this at all. Do you believe that every bank holds a physical dollar in a vault somewhere for every dollar in your bank account with your name on it? I would be very surprised if they did, but no one questions them or demands an audit knowing that banks do much shadier things than Bitfinex/Tether such as launder money for terrorists. \n\nThe only reason I can think of why people keep spreading this FUD is because they shorted or cashed out and their buy orders < $9k did not fill so they need to try to scare people away. It reminds me of all the Bcash shills that woke up and started talking about how Bcash is the real Bitcoin right around the time Coinbase launched BCH trading.",

            "Text": "> I'm afraid HODLing won't work this time and the bloodshed would be higher.\n\nsit along and enjoy the ride.  You probably don't mean this intentionally but that's concern trolling.  \n\n>If a not official note from South Korea triggered a -30/40% of the price of the CCs, what should we expect from this?\n\nCryptocurrencies are far more subjected to being manipulated than traditional currencies and don't quite have a large liquidity market yet (compared to traditional equities)...as such its easy to see volatility.  Historically there are always downturns and corrections backwards - I'm not sure if we see it cross below 8K or if it fully recovers and keeps bolstered growth.  One thing is for sure, we were sitting around 4k for a while then we suddenly saw 10% day over day kind of gains...\n\n>I am still positive though, but what the government want and do is scary...\n\nLet me know how DACA is going or how DCMA is shutting down torrenting or how the DEA is shutting down DNM... those things are fairing out poorly for the government...do you really think we should be concerned about cryptocurrency law?  Clearly a stranglehold can be acertained through enough persistent effort by lawmakers but the lack thereof is telling that aggregately crypto isn't considered a threat by lawmakers...once it happens and they do feel threatened... the sleeping giant of crypto awakens imo....but I too don't definitively know for sure.",

But that being said, right now maybe the best time to do day trading, because it is wobbling up and down, not by that much but very cyclic trading happening (for example, at gdax, during the last 4 hours,  we had 3 cycles that has highs around 10.05K euros and lows of around 9.9K...so if one was to follow very closely, and invested say 1 btc to play with, he/she could have theoretically made around 400 euros. .... but still very risky game to play full time with a lot of cash",

He has a cyber security background and thought of it as simply as hackers who have access to devices in bulk will just collect wallet keys and wait. This may be happening currently on a small scale but now that I think about it, if a state actor or someone with access to a lot of devices were interested, they could issue a large transference of funds into several wallets of their own. This panic will cause the public to lose trust in Bitcoin for quite some time. Until the public is educated to use secure storage, crypto will have an iffy immediate future. It is not as if this stuff is backed by the FDIC or secured by gold in a secured vault.",
