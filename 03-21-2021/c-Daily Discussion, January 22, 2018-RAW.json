Since the hash rate adapts to the total hashing power, it is even better for bitcoin if they shut the big players down because it gets easier for normal people to mine. But I don't understand why it is always used as a reason for the price drop.",

A long while. I mean, it has to go down to a price that is supported by adoption and other fundamentals. Then it has to level out for a while so everybody forgets about it. It has to become boring. Then it will need a chance to grow based on the fundamentals again. Then the press will be like \"Guess what asset grew 400% this year? Remember Bitcoin?\"",

And the only computer you have access to is one in hotel lobby.  Oftentimes these computers only have a browser enabled and you can\u2019t install other browsers (must use ie and can\u2019t install chrome) and they also have USB ports blocked off. \n\nSo for travel you need to\nHave a chrome book basically?  Can a phone be used ? I read something about androids  being usable but prob not iPhones. Right ?\n\nThank you ",

It makes sense for Wall Streeters because they make huge profits from selling off BTC from the futures, and then buy it back up to make even more money.\n\nI swear, these guys should get arrested for manipulating the markets.

            "Text": "Bitcoin hasn't yet solidified its place in the world beyond novelty and speculation, which means rumours are the wind beneath its sails. Even news items still just fall under the category of \"more substantial rumours\" until Bitcoin has tangible, real world, *realised* utility. \n\nThe same wind that blew it up to its ATH can just as easily bring it crashing back down to a fraction of that. Because it's all speculation. \n\nBut it doesn't change the fact that IF Bitcoin has viable real world utility, then none of this will matter, because the price will organically gravitate towards that point in due course and we'll look back on this month as the time when Bitcoin was insanely undervalued.\n\nNote the emphasis on \"IF\". We need to be realistic, but above all, the community and developers need to be smart and innovative. ",

Patterns, the time of day, movements and behavior, watching the order books, it all has to come together for you to be a good trader. I only day trade when it tanks.

There have been quite  a few periods in recent history of hyperinflation, where there would be a strong reason to use bitcoin. That describes the situation in Venezuela and Zimbabwe right now and Germany after WW1. Given the way the US government is totally incapable of responding to financial crises, and relies on short terms hacks like quantitive easing, massive inflation could easily happen there too. Do you believe the government of the USA is in any way competent right now? Are you familiar with why bitcoin was initially created?",
