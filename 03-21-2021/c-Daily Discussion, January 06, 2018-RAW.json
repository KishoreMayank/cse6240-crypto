            "Text": "I have a Trezor and I would like to monitor the coins in those addresses via google sheet with: https://medium.com/active-income/how-to-get-crypto-balance-from-your-wallet-in-google-sheets-c79a2702a038\n\nI have generated 4 fresh addresses with my Trezor and sent bitcoin to them.  The odd thing is that when I look at the balance of those 4 addresses, the total balance does not match the balance showing my Trezor UI.\n\nThis leads me to think there are somehow some hidden wallet addresses I'm not seeing in the Trezor UI.  I looked at on one of my test transactions and am trying to make sense of this.  I'm not sure how safe it is to post a link to one of my transactions but details are as follows:\n\n-I had previously sent x btc to a Trezor address\n\n-I then sent y btc (smaller than x) from my Trezor to another address \n\n-If I click on the y btc withdraw transaction in Trezor, it shows that x btc was sent from the original address to two 2 addresses.  y btc landed in one address I wanted to send it to (expected) and [x-y-fees] landed in another random new address (unexpected).\n\nSo it looks like instead of pulling y bitcoin out of the original address and leaving [x-y-fees] in the original address, it created a brand new address to hold the [x-y-fees].\n\nDo I own this new address and it's just not showing in the Trezor UI?  Does anybody understand my confusion here?  ",

It's a move to be more sure of avoiding big losses, but also big rapid gains.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bitcoin should be 30 to 70% of your investment, to have a solid base on which you can rely, but if you're talking about gains, gains, gains,  17k->21K is a little change.",
