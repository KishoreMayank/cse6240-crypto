            "Text": "To anyone who keeps focusing on price movement in the last few months and tends to evaluate bitcoin based on that:\n\nIf it goes lower then make hay and accumulate while you have the chance. It all depends on whether you are convinced by the use case or not. If you are then you should be happy to get an elongated accumulation period. If you are not then why did you consider bitcoin to be a good investment vehicle even while 'price was going up'? Did you decide that something becomes a good investment vehicle purely based on a supposition of sustained good sentiment?",

I like it when the price goes down because I get more BTC on my next purchase and I like it when it goes up because my existing stash is worth more. Helps that such regular purchases can be done at a click of a button on your phone. \n\nWhy do I do this? Because I am convinced of how bitcoin is unique and useful as an asset and transaction medium and I don't need market sentiment to make me understand this.\n\nIf you did this strategy starting Dec 2013 (peak of last bull run and start of multi-year bear market), you  broke even as early as nov 2015 which is just 3 months after the bottom was reached.",

And if I follow a rigid DCA accumulation strategy then I am sure many others are too. Even if such users are a tiny fraction of overall users, it means that every passing day results in bitcoin supply slowly passing into the hands of this base who don't assess bitcoin by just price sentiment. \n\nGiven that bitcoin has limited supply and the coming halving will even further cut down new supply, guess what this diminishing free float will eventually mean for the price. The mechanics here differ from what happened in the previous bear market only in scale. In the meanwhile technological and infrastructural progress in the bitcoin ecosystem continues and lubricates this process.",

You will also be shocked at how many books, web sites, classes and expert news and analysis sites there are, but none of them offer any guarantees or detailed statistical analyses of their own historical success. Lots of TA \u2018experts\u2019 point to one or two great calls that they\u2019ve made as proof, but they don\u2019t offer a full view of all their trades and their overall performance versus the market. \n\nWhat made this so hard for me was this idea that \u201cSurely this many people can\u2019t be COMPLETELY wrong - there must be SOME truth to it.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, there are many, many belief systems that are really popular but have no objective merit whatsoever. Zero. That\u2019s not uncommon at all. My expectation is the problem: human cognitive biases run really, really deep. It takes a crap-ton of effort to see them in your own thinking.",

Many bulls \ud83d\udc02 are on vacation right now, are optimistic long term, and not paying close attention to the price.  \n\nBears \ud83d\udc3b on the other hand are pessimistic and are constantly watching the price because they are scared or are opportunistic shorters. They have no life and are always watching price and don\u2019t take vacations.  \n\nMaybe that\u2019s why price is dumping despite TA that suggest the price should be increasing above the $7100 line since the short term moving average was just about to cross the long term moving average on the Cb pro one day chart.  This is usually an indicator that a pump is imminent. \n\nThat and possibly the Koreans are shorting now that Bithumb is finally back online.   \n\n",

Bitcoin is a rising tech, it's so obvious that my 8 year old nephew told me he wished he'd asked for some for his 5th birthday, His peers all the way up to young adults are all over this. They talk about it regularly. Just wait a few more years when they have influence over global finance.\n\nAnyway, I digress. You are a crypto bear, that's fine. Nobody cares about you or me or any of our opinions on here. But the future is happening with or without us and it's as clear as reading a book. It's playing out like a book with crypto developments and advancements made on every turn. STOP looking at the price. It's gone up IMMENSELY since its inception, more than any of us ever even fathomed.\n\nNone of us thought we'd see BTC over $1000 back when we started. To think even back, it still feels surreal that it has made this much progress.  Bitcoin is an unstoppable rising innovative tech. It's path is undeniable, based on what it has accomplished in such a short time. That blip of bubble in Dec past is not what you should be focusing on if you're smart. But then ... your math is pathetic.",

If you make a lucky call walk away and never come back. If you try again, the odds are good that you won't improve your track record.

I've been on reddit with 3 different user names over the past, and the investor group members I am with used to all post here regularly. There were trolls and and the odd person that never thought Bitcoin would become what it has then too. But everyone in my group left because the ratio started to shift from useful sharing and help, to whining and negativity and lambo talk.   \n\n\nI came back with this username because I still believe there can be value in this platform, but you really have to not let the bullshitters bother you. The world is pretty well aware that crypto is going to be a very large part of its future, with Bitcoin as the crown jewel. I have never felt more certain about this in 6 years than I do at this very moment.   \n\n\nKeep up your hopium and keep up your sharing. People like your posts.",

After looking for years I discovered that the explanation for why TA even exists is found in the science of behavioral economics and human cognition. It doesn't work, it never worked, but we are strongly biased toward finding patterns in randomness. We are compulsively drawn to narrative explanations for the things we see and TA is a byproduct of that. If you give a human a bunch of market data they will always find patterns and they will always avoid doing any probabilistic analysis of their patterns because we suck at estimating probabilities and we want the story to be true. It's the way human brains work. The same forces that drove us to invent god, astrology and faeries are behind phenomena like anti-vaxxer-ism, homeopathy, and TA.",

The price of all assets that are traded on markets goes up and down due to unforeseeable events, and it isn't possible to predict a particular price move (unless you manipulate the market). People who watch the price of an asset but don't have any particular time-frame in mind for selling it get trapped in the 'narrative illusion'. Imagined trends are analogous to 'lucky streaks' - they don't exist, but the perception of them drives people to turn unrealized losses into actual losses. The safest way to avoid this is to be very clear with yourself about your initial investing hypothesis and the fact that you have not actually suffered a loss until you realize it. \n\nI bought BTC at $6900, with a plan to hold it for a day. When it fell to $6850 I had lost nothing, because I didn't sell. When it went to $6950 I sold it and realized a gain.",

Nobody could tell me what the probabilities were for simple stuff like resistance levels. Nobody could explain to me why 10 different analysts could come up with 10 different numbers for a resistance level even though we all have the same data to work from. I started doing more research and our firm even hired 2 intern mathematicians to work on a study of our trading platform. \n\nThey tried to explain to the traders why TA didn't work, but the traders couldn't believe that the patterns they were seeing didn't actually exist. If you know any day traders, you can probably imagine how dismissive they were. The fact remains that one of our traders did better and outperformed the market, the others under-performed. They all had the same tools and they were all true believers, but over time, they all regressed to the mean and were not outperforming the traders that *never* looked at a stock chart or did any sort of TA at all. \n\nIf you talk to some insiders in the larger firms I think you'd find that this is a common pattern. Folks who outperform are welcome to blame it on anything they like: God, TA, Magic 8-Ball, lucky rabbit's foot, etc. Much of the time a reputation is built on nothing more than one or two lucky bets early on, but over time all day traders regress to the mean.\n\nThis isn't how my company works, but I have heard it suggested that some firms use TA as an excuse for kicking up a lot of trades to obscure the trades that are actually driven by insider information. If an investigator looks at the data and asks why a trade was made, they just point to some chart patterns and all the other noisy trading they've done. Makes it very hard to spot.",
