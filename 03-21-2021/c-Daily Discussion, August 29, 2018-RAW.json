Bitcoin actually has developers working on it and a solid small community that wants to see it succeed, so if you want to be part of the next 1000%+ increase you're gonna have to waddle through the bottom.",

            "Text": "If you look at the chart BTC/USDT (Binance), it has made 3 tops in the main bull run being 19,798.68 and after that it got a massive correction it again got pumped up to 11,786.01 and  after another correction back to the same level of 6,000, it got another pump up to 10,020USDT. Then it again dropped back to around 5,750 and pumped up to 8491.77 which again got dumped back to 5,700USDT. As you can see, according to this pattern, after every time it tested 6,000 support throughout the year, it made a bounce back but only to meet a lower high than the previous one. Therefore, in order to confirm that we are in a bull run, I believe Bitcoin should break 8,500USDT and that would definitely give a clear indicator of a bull run which would indeed lead to a new ATH.",

I may have jumped the gun.  Not much of a reaction yet.  We may have to wait another 24 hours to see  an effect. \n\nThus, let\u2019s be prepared for highly probably boost at approximately 8/31/18. 00:00 UTC time when the lines cross with more conviction. \n\nEdit 2: \n\nOh, by the way, it may boost anytime between now and then as well. \n\nEdit 3:\n\n10 hr update:  Well I\u2019m just gonna admit now this was a bad call.   The variable I did not consider this time was how time of year might affect price action.  End of August is prime vacation time in the USA and it may be the case that some of the bulls are in vacation mode and not paying close attention to price. \n\nI\u2019m no expert by far, but I have been watching price action for the last 6 months and have found the crossing of the moving averages to be a fairly reliable indicator of short term action.   As I showed back in April we had a huge rally after the moving averages crossed on the one day chart.  But it also happens to a much smaller degree when the averages cross on the 6hr, 1hr, and 15 min chart. \n\nI find it interesting that as soon as the lines started to cross this time all of a sudden we have a large dump. Could be shorters just taking advantage of the buying vacuum.   Very strange price action. \n\nNow with price dropping, the moving averages may not fully cross and ema12 may drop back below ema26.  We\u2019ll see. I still say September is going to be bullish leading up to the VanEck etf decision.   But of course, this is bitcoin and anything is possible. ",

I then asked about 10nm as it's not even out yet. Internal debate on moving forward but the gains on 7nm are massive I was told. TSMC has a 7nm process out already. Anyone who has been able to develop an asic on 7nm from what he was saying would have a massive advantage. \n\nAnyone else wonder why difficulty is going up with a flat price? Next gen is likely already in secret use and will eventually be made public after the low hanging fruit is picked ",

I imagine that will happen within the next six months, and I don't think we'll see terribly lower prices, but mostly market sentiment just needs some time to turn and I would be surprised if that occurs in 2018.  \n  \nFrom a technical standpoint, it all looks like roses to me - LN adoption coming along nicely, schnorr sigs on the way, so those could help.

I think it will be a bear market until at least 2020 (and that it will be a hard bear market for the rest of 2018, with 2018 finishing around $4000 or less).",

In the case of crypto, the naysayers have really ran with the tether thing. They have no comprehension of the way tether works and how massive volume in tether is perfectly understandable. Take the Korean exchanges for example. All those alt coins that had their revenue drained out to tether. If the exchange does not deal with tether then the alts are typically converted to BTC and transferred to an exchange that does offer tether trading. That's just one of many variables not considered by the conspiracy theories.",

If you wait it out there's a strong chance you'll regain your losses because this is still a very young market. \nBut if a door opens and closes, and you walk into it while closed and break your nose... that doesn't mean you should waste hours of your time trying to preach to others that the doorway is a bad way to get to the other side. Maybe use the lesson you learned to make better decisions in the future. Or even advise others to invest at a more opportune entry point. At least that would be a decent use of your time.",

They want to feel secure that they aren\u2019t sending their money to a scammer or fraudulent site.    \n\nI started on Coinbase and felt relatively safe.  Then I learned about Gemini.  IMO these are the safest for newbies.  Coinbase is very simple to use.  I think both are as trustworthy as you can get. \n\nThe wallets do need to improve and must become absolutely idiot proof.   It should become nearly impossible to send money to the wrong address.  Maybe need multiple verifications before sending. I\u2019m not sure the best solution but someone will invent it. \n\n\nEdit:  we need to start seeing commercials for Coinbase/Gemini on tv and on banner ads for mainstream sites.  Marketing, Marketing, Marketing.  Need to make it really simple and inviting for the masses. ",

There's a great deal of progress being made, both with framework & code and with partnerships among industry giants. Before you publicly cite your opinion, at least do a little research so as to make that opinion an informed one. As an example, you mentioned bitcoin being an old tech... but it's that very fact, with its proven network  stability, that makes it a worthwhile investment of the time and effort that coders are contributing to improve its ability to accommodate higher volume, faster transactions, and user friendly interfaces for acquiring. \nYou need a test period of actual use to become worth improving. Not some project that is no more than a white paper concept.\nThe internet was not replaced, it was scaled. That's how it works.",
