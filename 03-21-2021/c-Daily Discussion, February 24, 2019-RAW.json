If it drops again you buy another 20%, and if it moons you got your main stack so you don't miss out.

Then you open Electrum with your hardware wallet, and set up Electrum so that it reads/sends everything through your own node.  \n\nIt sounds a bit tricky, but soon bitcoin core will be implementing hardware wallet support directly, so it'll be less complex (it's not *that* complex anyway, but might sound like it at the first glance ;) )  \n\nEdit: for a raspberry pi node this is a helpful guide for connecting a hardware wallet: https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/blob/master/raspibolt/raspibolt_64_electrum.md",

I just want to get in and be one of the people making money off of these new bees.  Knowing that some of the new bees will be buying/selling bases on emotions, how can i take advantage of their emotions to make myself wealthy?
