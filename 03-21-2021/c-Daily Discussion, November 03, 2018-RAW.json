Ver and fake satoshi Craig Wright are too good at getting at new investors. First time I\u2019m worried. Segwit is dropping to below 45%. \n\nPeople naturally want kings, queens and presidents and Btrash is centralizing itself according to human nature. Bitcoin needs to step up and stop being the leader in name only. The community is stronger than this. Come on!! Segwit has to get higher. It\u2019s the one thing that separates bitcoin from Btrash.
