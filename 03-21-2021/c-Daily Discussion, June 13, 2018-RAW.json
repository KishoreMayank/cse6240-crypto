            "Text": "In early days when I first joined the community, there was a saying about what to do after you have bought bitcoins. Basically it is \"Hold and only spend\". At first glance, this seemed contradictory to me. But with time I get the idea and it makes total sense. That's the way to help bitcoin grow.\n\nSadly, nowadays people are waiting for the main stream adoption, which equals to \"institution pumping up\" the price. In general , institution money are the smarter one, especially in the traditional market. Expecting to make money from theirs is a bit cute.\n\nIn hinder sight and look what happened in the end of the last year, bitcoin's network had huge problem and vendors that accepted bitcoin were also leaving in group. That should have got us worried when the network seemed not working well. But the \"good\" news was that the future markets were opening. If we had been sober, there were enough signs indicating bitcoin would suffer huge drop after the future market opening.\n\nIn short, we should focus on the definition of mainstream adoption which is having more places where you can spend bitcoin, instead of institution money pumping for us. It was very likely much of institution money has been in, they pumped prior the future market and had eaten those who had bought at the top.\n\nAnd today, with much better fundamentals for bitcoin, the price is however dropping like no tomorrow. This is almost the opposite to what happened in the end of the last year. So better watch out.\n\nFor those who can make money in this volatile market, good for you. To the believers, \"hold and spend\". That's what I learned in the earlier days here. I'm saying it again to those who are new.",

Crypto is not going anywhere and  big money wants to play. For that they need regulatory approval. Banks also want in.\n\nHere's the catch, they need time for that. Regulatory bodies need time to debate and draft documents. Banks need their software slave army to make their systems compatible. Until then they don't want to see price growth so they are doing their best to spread misinformation and FUD.\n\nDecember 2017 was just a media test case to see what kind of frenzy can be generated. Conclusion: unprecedented frenzy level. So that was shut down to prepare for the next one.\n\nThere is all this talk about selling. selling selling selling selling. No one is selling anymore. The trivial amount of retail investor capital that came in was not as much as the hype suggested. Most people didn't know how to or couldn't get through the account registration bottle neck. Whatever portion of those that cut their loses have already done so long ago.\n\nWhatever 'selling' is occuring is shorting. At this point that is all just paper proffit. The only way to realise the profit is to close the positions with a buy order. There is a tremendous amount of short paper proffit currently. It is not all going to be realised as as soon as the first big player to flinch in this game of chicken closes their position we are going to see things jump fast and the whole domino cascade occurs.\n\nContinuing to short this further is just mental. It is no different than going hyper-bull long at 19k.\n\nBitcoin was doing just fine without the banks or the regulators. The only thing that has changed since then is their FUD and a torrent of bullish fundamentals, tech evolution and adoption.\n\nIn my view, waiting out for 5k is just chart reading hocus pocus. I'm eating popcorn waiting for the first whale who is delusional and high from staring at paper proffits to wake up and realise \"oh crap! I forgot I actually have to close this, and doing so when the bear pressure has dried up is the worst time for it.\" and closes out before the big green super dong candle suddenly appears.",

Big blocks have been sold dropping this down to where its at, but the problem right now is that BTC sentiment and interest is at a low. Google trends shows bitcoin searches, buy bitcoin searches, etc have just plummtted. In 2013, BTC went to about 1200 and fell to around 100. A fall like that would mean BTC could seek the 4-5k price again. I doubt it, but the bottom is where people are at a point where they panic and just dont think it can go any lower. I wish 6300 was bottom but one big dump of 3-4k coins again and we will break 6000. GLTA.",

Determine your own loss threshold and do not be afraid to sell if it hits that threshold.  If it goes lower after that, you can always buy back.  And if it goes higher, you simply missed a small profit opportunity.\n\n2.   Hodl if you can afford.  There were two spikes (2013 and 2017).  Whether manipulated or not, it happened and there's a chance that it might happen again in future.\n\nStay safe, don't lose more than you can afford by listening to other BS here promising the moon.

Iam not worried or selling anything. I will just buy more maybe next month when the price will floor before next rampup. I dont know why people dont se it in wider perspective. If you will buy 20M bitcoins and there will be massive shortage of it on the market, the price will skyrocket and you can then sell then slowly for major profit. (Same is for stocks/bonds/housing...) As soon as people understand that they need to make huge shortage on the market to make real profit, the faster the price will go up. On the opposit when crysis starts, there is always flood of everything and price go down... Thats the principle of rising prices of eggs during easter, turkey on thanksgiving... You have to make shortage of anything. When i unzoom Price chart on GDAX (that tide graph in the middle) you can see 12K BTC to buy and 4K BTC to sell. If I remember correctly, the chart on november looked like 9K to buy and 3K to sell. We only need to shrink the market now. There is too much BTC on markets. Yeah a lot of people want to get rich, but this time is best time to buy BTC from weak hands and just wait for opportunity.",

Although, I doubt that the most aggressive bulls among you are actually buying the dip. You and all the other moonboys are likely just trying to inject hopium into others so that they will buy. ",

More suckers buying into the same dream that you have, that they too will get rich quick. Maybe it does moon again, the price going higher relies on newer people coming in, paying higher than you \n\nSure we like to look at stories of few early adopters that got rich, that's what makes bitcoin so enticing. But the fact of the matter is most people don't make money off crypto. We can't all get lambos, the few lambos and whales who take advantage of pumps and dumps do so out of all the people's investments who got in for the same reason as you. ",

If my assessment is correct, Bitcoin may stay below $3k for some time if it does get that low. \n\nIf you haven't unloaded already, then holding and waiting for this storm to pass may be the best option. No reason to sell any now as it is nearly $6k. Selling now means instant loss. Holding and waiting for it to rise, and it will rise again, will preserve your stash and future capital.",

I'm not saying there's no guarantee it won't, but there's no guarantee either ways.\n\nI don't know what price you bought Bitcoin at, lets say 10k. You bought it because you believe it will moon to 100k. For someone to buy it at 100k, they have to believe it will moon to 1 million and so forth. Do you not understand my point? Bitcoin's price reflects this speculative game that's zero sum. It's not some magical infinitely growing money where everybody wins. People don't buy bitcoin to use its technology, they buy it for dreams of yacht based on \"potential\" adoption of the tech by *other* people. Isn't this a perfect description of you and many others here?\n\nDoesn't feel good right now that Bitcoin is at 6k right? Right now there are people who made their profits selling bitcoin to you. All you're hoping for when it moons is for the next batch of idiots to buy into the get rich quick scheme so you can profit off  *their* dreams of retiring, getting rich, not working, etc. Maybe they want to study physics too instead of being at corporate office. Even if your dream comes true, all you've done is profit their dreams while they're still stuck at the office with their hard earned money gone",

BTC speculation does not involve recruiting participants under you, and then taking profits from those people under you. That is the definition of a pyramid scheme. BTC has no relation to a pyramid scheme at all. ",
