            "Text": "The fact that it's not mooning now doesn't mean it's not a good investment opportunity or it's a bad situation. The fact the price is flat for a couple of months is actually a good thing after a crash. This is what you want to see after a crash. Every good investor will tell you the best moment to invest is when the volatility is gone. It means short time speculators pulled out and the market pretty much hit the bottom or is close to the bottom. It means people are numb/pessimistic or cynical about the market. No fomo, low volume. The best signs when you want to invest long term. Now, it would be different if the market imploded and btc was going down to zero. Then you deal with a tulip mania. It means nobody believes it has underlying value. The last crypto crash is like the .com bubble: weeding out bad projects, lots of people losing their money cause they invested in bad project, hypermania gone. One thing we learned about the .com bubble is it takes time before prices go back to all time highs. Luckily, ten years with .com businesses is like two years in crypto. So everything moves faster. It took Microsoft 15 years before reachibg ath of 2000 again. Let's say with btc it's going to take 3 to 6 years. Still a long time and it's difficult to have patience. But it is what it is ",

The network fees are much higher than others.  And the price is volatile so you can't really use it for everyday currency to buy things.  Now that USDC is available, you can purchase it, buy and sell things without the risk of price fluctuations, and then convert it back to fiat for very little cost.  Who on earth would accept Bitcoin when you can accept USDC without the high cost, 10-90 minute verification window and the risk of it's value going down?

If you understand blockchain, you know how much more effective and efficient it can make economies. So it's only a matter of time before the whole system works on blockchain, from governments to companies.  Now, what will be the role of btc in this system? You need to see btc as the symbol of this new system that will emerge. The dollar is the symbol of the old system, btc will be the symbol of the new system. The more blockchain will be adopted (governments and institutions are working on it everywhere), the more popular btc will become. It doesn't really matter if btc will become a good payment method. It is the symbol of a new system, and alot of people have TRUST in it, like people trust the dollar. This trust will rise. The more blockchain adoption, the more trust there will be in btc.",

            "Text": "you could delay sending out the mined block (lets say block=100) and start mining a new block (block=101) on top of it, but there is a risk that another miner will also find a block (block='100) and propagate it through the network first.  \nIn that case unless you mine block 101 before the entire network finds block '101, then your block 100 and 101 will become worthless.  \nEven if you have 50% of the hashrate you will be risking a 50% chance of losing the reward over a slight advantage of mining the next block.  \n\nIt might be an interesting study to see whether there is a divergence between the ratio of the pool's hash rate to the actually found number of blocks.",

Even if USDC does succeed in mass adoption, it doesn't mean its success will hurt bitcoin. They have two different purposes and goals. There are other stable coins that have been out before USDC so its not like its anything new. Bitcoin and other cryptocurenccies have room to improve, but more importantly it is possible for it to improve.",

Functioning as a currency may have been the original concept, but as we know from history, sometimes the most disruptive technologies used by society began as a solution or tool for a completely different use case than it became adopted for. \nEven if Bitcoin ever replaced FIAT, that would take many many years. But to function as an alternative currency, exceptional store of value that could easily return gains for years to come, high speed transfer of large amounts of money overseas and a bridge to cross currencies, and multiple uses not even thought of yet... Bitcoin has incredible potential for a growing digital society. \n\nIt has the network value of computing power and can become the most accurate accounting tool to record wealth and transactions on a global level. It's potential to function as a hedge alone has barely even been recognized compared to how it will be utilized in years to come. This is just the beginning.",
