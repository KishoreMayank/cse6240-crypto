I hope we moon short term but this also helps re-affirm the long term bullish outlook for Bitcoin.\n\nSegwit adoption is doing very well, and growing fast\nLightning Network is growing much faster than expected\nPeople are more aware of Bitcoin than ever before, and Bitcoin is taken more seriously than ever before.\nWe have new talent from all over the world working on various Bitcoin and Blockchain products, from coders and software developers to entrepreneurs.\nPossibly the biggest fear that the US govt will somehow try and BAN Bitcoin has been assuaged with things like approval Bitcoin futures trading on the CBOE.\n\nIn the last year, especially the last 6 months we have seen the Bitcoin ecosystem grow more than ever before. People are writing books and speaking at conventions, people are making a living running YouTube channels dedicated to Bitcoin. People are making a living with Bitcoin ATMs or facilitating the need to buy sell and educate about Bitcoin, in much higher numbers. Universities offer real courses about Blockchain.\n\nAnd of course the ecosystem around mining has grown immensely. Creating jobs and benefiting companies who make  graphics chips like Nvidia.  Samsung alone has invested massively into the Halong miner. The list goes on.\n\nThe ecosystem around Bitcoin has become a integral part of our economy and in another year will be responsible for a A LOT more economic growth. \n\nThis is only going to get bigger.\n",

Over the past week there was a temporary perspective of transferring existing alt investment into BTC, because it required no additional FIAT.\n\nIMO, that phase is over and you'll start to see alts being dragged up right along with BTC again now. This whole market is one of balance, and unless you're trading daily, it won't affect you in the long term. BTC dominance is good for both Bitcoin and alts if you really think about it.",

In the future, however, the protocol may be updated to allow further subdivisions, should they be needed.\"](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/114/what-is-a-satoshi)\n\nThere are currently about 14 million Bitcoin in circulation (3-4 million have been lost forever and the rest of the 21 million have yet to be mined). 1,400,000,000,000,000 Satoshi's (14,000,000 x 100,000,000) is enough for 7 billion people to each own 200,000.\n\nIn 2015 [Credit Suisse published a report](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=F2425415-DCA7-80B8-EAD989AF9341D47E) that calculated the total of all wealth in the world to be valued at approximately $250,000,000,000,000 (250 trillion USD). If all the wealth in the world (as of 2015) were converted to BTC, each Satoshi would've had a value approximately equal to $0.18.\n\nIn 2017, [MarketWatch published an article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-money-exists-in-the-entire-world-in-one-chart-2015-12-18) that estimated the total USD value of all gold and currency in circulation to be $7.6 trillion and $7.7 trillion (respectively), for a total of $15.3 trillion. If all of the currency and gold in the world were replaced with Bitcoin, a Satoshi would have a value roughly equal to $.01.\n\nI don't think running out of Bitcoin is going to be a problem.",

Legal ownership is not the same as physical control. If Coinbase fucks up in some way (gets hacked or suffers a techical issue), you may never get your money back. A personal wallet is insurance from that, but now the responsibility not to fuck up is on you. As Andreas recently stated, the best way to store Bitcoin is probably hardware wallets because you can have full control while eliminating most security risks, and you don't need to be a security expert for that.",

Run it, carefully do what it tells you to do (create a mnemonic phrase so that you can restore the wallet if something bad happens, write it down, store securely). Once set up, go to the \"Receive\" tab - there you will find the address to send to from Coinbase. Send the money and wait anxiously for 10-100 minutes to see the transaction go through.\n\nEdit: Perhaps the most important thing to understand is the only asset here is the **private keys**. Your bitcoin balance is recorded on the blockchain and does not exist outside of it. A wallet does not store bitcoin, it stores the keys. The keys allow you to sign transactions, i.e., to change your balance on the blockchain. Right now, Coinbase has the keys to your money.",

            "Text": "In principle, yes. It is just less secure* and thus not a wise choice for long-term storage, especially for large amounts. For now, you will probably be fine, but you should at least learn how to store your money in your own pocket and not somebody else's.\n\n*Why less secure? Basic economics of theft. A centralized exchange is a lucrative target for hackers - little risk, high rewards. If someone finds a vulnerability in Coinbase security (which surely exist, as they do in any complex system), they will sweep all the accounts they can. On the other hand, if you have a personal wallet, the potential gains are tiny in comparison, and the costs are large: the attack would need to be targeted, they would need to access to your specific machine, and in the case of hardware wallets, they would need physical access. Not really worth it in most cases, and outright impossible if nobody knows you have bitcoin.\n\nBut Coinbase is probably better than a software wallet on a malware-ridden personal machine.",
