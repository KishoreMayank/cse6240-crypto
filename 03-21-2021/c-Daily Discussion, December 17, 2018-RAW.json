While it\u2019s true in the sense that mining decentralization is essential to the network\u2019s  security (e.g. to prevent 51% attacks), full nodes also play a role a significant role. Any invalid blocks would be detected and rejected by any full node in the network, which includes, but isn\u2019t limited, to miners.\n\nThe second one is about the network not being adaptive to supply and demand, since supply is only decreased by halvening which doesn\u2019t occur often. The network is, in fact, adaptive to decreased mining power, by means of difficulty adjustments that occurs often and re-balance mining profits with bitcoin price.\n",

Last time I saw anything similar was when Mtgox was going down, and they had problems with fiat withdraws, so the only way to get funds out was to buy bitcoin, and transfer that out. This had the effect of distorting the price on the specific exchange. I have not head of any problems like that on Bitfinex. So my guess is that it is a similar effect, but caused by people using Tether to buy bitcoin, and these trades being more likely to be buys than sells for some reason.",

There're some in this reddit who believe in conspiracy theories and so I wouldn't be surprised if they have Dinars and/or silver. Not saying silver is worthless but a lot of people bought it because they read somewhere that it's going to skyrocket soon. The Iraqi dinar is a terrible investment, mainly because of the high premium.",

A while back someone asked how bitcoin has never been hacked when all these stories were floating around about stolen bitcoin. It's the same difference, bitcoin was not hacked, exchanges were. That's like blaming money that a bank was robbed. Bottom line, the kind of manipulation happening with markets will always be present  and regardless of the currencies we use, there will always be a small percentage of people with a large percentage of wealth, because some people are far more resourceful than others.",

Others value the fiat more, so they sell BTC.  It really is that simple.  Of course the hard part is deciding how much you personally value BTC.  Many people here value it highly, which is part of why they hang in this sub.  Doesn't mean you have to value it.  Where you might learn something interesting is if you ask why people value it.  \n\nYour Second question... I don't speculate or care if a pump and dump happens.

We're just tried of answering the same questions.\n\nI believe that a global currency on a tamper proof ledger that can be applied to endless scenarios to provide benefits going forward is worth betting on. Of course we want to see gains on our investment, but most people I know personally that are invested in Bitcoin also believe it has an incredibly bright future as an alternative mainstream currency, particularly for future generations in a digital society. That being said, this is indeed a very speculative market... but a very real market that is growing rapidly and not going away. So, in short to answer your question, a little of both!",

When I think of all that bitcoin can do for society and the internet my heart beats faster. I'm passionate about it that's why I didn't sell at the peak. It's gambling and it's also a protest to our financial system. The biggest display of it's intrinsic value will be first seen with decentralized identity. The lead dev of Microsoft's decentralized identity project recently revealed that Microsoft has partnered to offer decentralized identity via a public blockchain. He said that if you look at the source code you can figure out which public blockchain they plan on using. When digging through the source you will discover that they are going to use Bitcoin! You can figure it out because the source code states they are going to use a public blockchain where the miners use proof of work. Ethereum is going to switch to proof of stake so... You can connect the dots from there. They already have an identity system that uses Ethereum via Azure.\n\nCheck out @csuwildcat\u2019s Tweet: https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/1069889631313752064?s=09\n\nEDIT: Here is the source code: \n\nCheck out @csuwildcat\u2019s Tweet: https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/1069761400518496256?s=09\n",

The thing is though, when it was soaring last year it was not rational to expect it to keep going up, and now, it is not rational to expect it to keep going down. Whether it was 3200 or if it drops back lower nobody can know, but it will almost certainly go back up.",

The stock market took a massive hit today which is ALWAYS AN OMINOUS SIGN FOR BITCOIN. A bad economy and bad stock market will lead to bearish signals for Bitcoin. So, why did today\u2019s crypto market contradict the stock market? Because it is a fool\u2019s pump planned by the whales after the past two horrid months of a bear market. They have been running these bullish signals in the past two months. It\u2019s been a setup for even a greater fall. Small pumps followed by large dumps. That\u2019s how we got from $7K in November to $3K in December. I have no clue what bullish signals you\u2019re referring to - there aren\u2019t any. Are you making that up? For the most part, a poor stock market has correlated to a bad crypto market. The whales planned this small bull run before this stock market crash. The whales can\u2019t predict the stock market. If the stock market did great today, people would create some fake rationale that stock market optimism leads to Bitcoin optimism. I guess it\u2019s a novelty these days to rejoice when you see green - Stockholm Syndrome likewise a rape victim who sympathizes over her attacker.",

            "Text": "Network value is directly correlated with its participants. There's computer networks and there's the general concept of network. If Bitcoin were a few years old, one could perhaps say that anyone could set up a decentralized network, but after 10 years and somewhere around 10,000 mining nodes to secure and maintain the transactions, good luck trying to emulate that kind of success. However, if someone does create a new network with the same security and participation then of course that network would also build value.\n\nHow much do you think a secure tamper-proof network maintained by perfect math and redundancy would be worth to a large business? What about Facebook's social network, how is it valued? - by participants. The inventor of Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe, created Metcalfe\u2019s Law which states that a network\u2019s value is proportional to the square of the number of its users. Networks need to have features that attract participants, and then the compounded value of the features plus the participants, creates total value. In Bitcoin's case, many add in the cost of production, or its POF feature which provides the exceptional security that Bitcoin has demonstrated for years.\n\nCurrently we are in the process of discovering value, and this will go on for decades in my opinion, as Bitcoin becomes more distributed and used as a container to store wealth. Because another argument, which makes a lot of sense, is that Bitcoin's value is directly proportional to the amount of money people store within it. The economists of the future definitely have their work cut out for them! Currently, they are having a hard time relating to value in this sense, because their entire concept of money and their careers, have been built upon the fiat system. We'll get there! One thing is for sure, Bitcoin is growing across the planet rapidly and will be here long after we are all dead.",

Because it's a closed loop and it produces no benefits to society, sounds a tad familiar doesn't it.\n\nIt's also interesting you brought up social networks. While they certainly have value, a pure social network is not sustainable - like the Ponzi, you need a constant injection of new data, new users, to keep it going. Once it reaches saturation, it slowly dies out. Facebook knows this, which is why they are monetising the data on the social networks like crazy - sometimes immorally or illegally. It's also why they are aggressively expanding into other areas with the money realised from social networks instead of reinvesting it into that aspect of the business - because they know it is on a timer.\n",

            "Text": "No it's not at all like a ponzi scheme. But it is a lazy way of making a comparison. It's like comparing an orange to a pumpkin because they share the same color. Look harder before you say things that showcase your lazy research. The demand of participants is a common denominator across the board. No customers no business. A currency and store of value needs to be valued by participants in order to function as such. That's what is happening with bitcoin. It's what's been happening for a decade. Acknowledge it, or pretend you think it's a 10 year ponzi scheme, either way this is happening. You'd be a blind fool not to see it.",
