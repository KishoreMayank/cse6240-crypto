I just convinced my wife to continue our balls to the wall, pedal to the metal crypto investment strategy into 2019.  Once in a lifetime opportunity here to accumulate at the bottom that I will not be so stupid to miss. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Wall Street Could Change The Game For Bitcoin Again**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>That\u2019s according to a recent story published on Friday\u2019s Wall Street Journal. Launched by the Intercontinental Exchange, the new contract will be settled in Bitcoins rather than in dollars.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>Reducing the price volatility will pave the way for the digital currency to be accepted as a means of payment in everyday transactions. Like the buying of coffee in Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts outlets.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n> All these products could help the digital currency move from the \u201cinnovator\u201d and \u201cearly adopter\u201d stage in the Rogers Curve, to the \u201cearly majority.\u201d That\u2019s when demand for a product turns into a cascade, and the product becomes an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>And that would be good news for Bitcoin bulls, as an \u201cepidemic\u201d means higher Bitcoin prices, especially since Bitcoin is in limited supply.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/12/22/wall-street-could-change-the-game-for-bitcoin-again/#1ea917b02e01\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n[- Hopium Time Archives -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/) ",
