After all, things actually did look a lot bleaker at that point than it does today not just because of price but because of the mt gox hack, much lesser mainstream interest, etc.\n\nI also answered in a separate post about your concern of 'better tech' supplanting bitcoin.",

Neither me nor any of my friends even tracked or cared much about the price beyond the usual conversion back to fiat when we buy stuff.\n\nSo my viewpoint is that it was useful, not a big game changer as only anonymous sellers insisted on being paid with it.
