After all, the whales are the biggest HODLers. The whales don\u2019t actually define true HODLers but they believe in Bitcoin\u2019s adoption-and-fortune more than everyone. That\u2019s why their primary interest is to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible towards our 21 million destination. This is why they run constant buy sell walls, rinse and repeat, pumps and dumps, etc...all just to get novice traders to sell. The whales all want your Bitcoin because they know it will prosper in the end and become the new gold. To those who can\u2019t be shaken or swayed by such manipulation, I respect you.",

This is likely a daytrading whale who has $100 million he can afford to lose...and he noticed a trend that the bigger whales were going to dump BTC again below $6K so he panick sold. This is something the whales don\u2019t like. They don\u2019t like being beaten at their own game even though technically they won this smaller whale should sold at $6500 which would have saved him $2.4 million. But, my point it was NOT a stop sell order. It was definitely a market order that people are speculating it to hidden when hidden orders on most exchanges is an oxymoron. Don\u2019t believe that whales can only see limit orders on exchanges, particularly on those Asian exchanges. Whales can see ALL orders, so this is smaller whale was smart by pulling a surprise on them and dumping $75 million of BTC for the whales to eat up. I kinda enjoy watching the whales feel powerless for a moment.",

            "Text": "First I'd suggest learning about Bitcoin, the current growth in development, and why that growth is continuing upward while the coin price for years, always seems to lag behind the growth of infrastructure. If you can understand why Bitcoin as an investment does not always line up with what's going in with efforts to make it easier to acquire and store, then you will have enough understanding to make a sound decision on whether or not you want to buy it. Because along the way of researching the above, you will learn a great deal about it as a currency, store of value, and as an investment, and what it has to offer as a hybrid decentralized entity in all three verticals.\n\nI am a part of a group of friends and online acquaintances, who are long time investors in Bitcoin,  and by collaborating with these gentlemen I still learn something new every day. So don't worry about knowing it all, just get an overall knowledge.\n\nIf you decide to buy in, learn the options to purchase and store it safely. This is critical.\n\nIf you'd like some personal insight, I can tell you that some of these guys have been buying Bitcoin for over 6 years, and with the exception of coins bought since January, they have never lost on their investment. Nobody can possibly predict the future, but I can tell you that not one of us is worried about this year's price decrease. We saw it drop 90% once and still gained everything back in less than a year. Bitcoin is a wild ride but the overall projectory is up, so long as you have the stomach for the rollercoaster ride... because it has never moved straight up. The bubble last year was a bad entry point and the peak of the hype cycle. All innovative tech experiences this, but you're in luck because we're past it.",

Even tho they all have different parameters. Most likely Van-Eck will get delayed again as well. Was Sept 30., prolly hear a week before that they are delaying again. The market will react negatively...again (even tho most already have that intuition that says an ETF will eventually get approved...)\n\nPS. Notice they haven't jumped out in front of the Aug 23rd date for Proshares to say delay like they did with Van-Eck... Thats one of the reasons i picked 75% denial. Also notice no hype or fomo with 3 days left for decision. Just my take on it.\n\n\n",

You're going to have more people buying .1 btc at 25k than you will people buying 1 at 2.5k\n\nLow prices scare people off that's why this thing has been feeding on itself. People say that bullshit about crypto moving faster than Wall Street but this bear Market is lasting longer or at least as long as the average equities bear Market\n\nThe real irony I find is there is absolutely no reason for it. I can point to very specific reasons in every equities bear Market in the past hundred years. I can even point to a really good reason in the last Bitcoin bear Market. This one however. Zero\n\nThe only thing we're going to get if we have substantial drops from here is a drop-in Network hash power. Then you're going to see a lot of the altcoins get 51% attacked\n\nThat's the one thing I find very concerning about the price action right now and this setup we are creating for another drop.

There is no impending catalyst that will result in Bitcoin reverting to a 5 digit number. People don\u2019t like your comment because it\u2019s depressing and it eliminates their hope. They want to hear Bitcoin will hit $25K this year. But your last statement is a little absurd. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to be adopted by the masses as a payment methods in order to increase in price. If an ETF is accepted by the SEC, then see you at the moon. That is the type of development that could totally refute your statements here. But, as it currently stands, you\u2019re right. It just seems that you\u2019re more concerned with being downvoted than posting links to support your theory.",

You ever notice whenever a crime happens they have this emotional Outburst but before the crime took place they never gave it a second thought? They do the same thing with markets. It takes people months for their mind to begin to turn. Unless we get constant support from institutions Iceberging orders and giving us a horizontal Trend I think a lot of Main Street is going to just continue to dump. when the market finally turns they will be the same ones buying their same coins back at twice the price.  I'm just really not sure how low or how long that will take. We are due for a market turn in September on the long cycle. If we start getting higher lows and higher highs that's very bullish for next year. If we get a down turn testing 5300 and then bouncing off of the sixes that's bearish. We have an announcement on another no name ETF on Thursday and it might be an excuse for the shorts to Pile in again because it's very likely to be denied or delayed.\n\nRetail buyers are simply terrified right now.",

There's a really good chance it's going to be a solid brake and it could go either way. The nervous part of me is looking at the ETF on September 30th as being the catalyst. If this lower high pattern continues we're going to Rally up again into the mid 7s. Then drift. Test support and at that point there is basically nowhere to go.

It's going to take awhile for people's emotions to switch over.\n\nIt's like that ridiculous comment that we have heard all year. Yeah I'm bullish long-term but I'm short-term bearish.\n\nI really don't think it will take a lot to get people excited again period a few key players that bring our trading range up to $10,000 would probably bring a lot of people back. We just need to have a series of higher highs begin even if we go into a sideways range. I think the most depressing part right now is that every month you keep getting lower lows and people wonder where it's going to end",

That pretty much completes the wedge which means sometime before the end of October we should have a break out one way or the other. If this thing breaks bearish it's going to be a 2014-2015 repeat all over again for absolutely no reason. \n\nThat's why I'm saying people are terrified. The news is actually really good.
