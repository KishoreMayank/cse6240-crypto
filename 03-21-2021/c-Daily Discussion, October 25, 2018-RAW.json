Come on what bs, i would LOVE that to happen but i think we, the non-rich investors, are being seriously set up. The institutional investors have bought in a LONG time ago after bitcoin fell to $6k and ripple at $0.22. They missed 2017 bull run but they manipulated the market back down to get in and as greedy as they are i am anticipating a further decline. The seriously rich don't play with small fry, they take from the poor and trade with the rich. Would you see rich poker players playing with poor poker players? No they play BIG stakes. The OTC market is theirs for the time being and unfortunately for us,the retail market, the true value is not being accounted for on coinmarketcap - our retail exchanges order books do not reflect this, BUT if we put our crypto away and forget it - DON'T LET EMOTION DICTATE YOUR ACTIONS. Before you guys flame me, understand this is just a opinion that can be something to keep at the back of your minds, and should the above prove true you can act accordingly. The Elite, the governments, wealthy want all the money and control, they don't want us to have wealth as they will lose control because of it. Eventually the OTC market will bridge into ONE market and THEN i think the Crypto Market will be massive but dont have expectations of a time frame guys. Invest with money you wont need for a few years and HODL! Wishing you all FREEDOM as i do for myself. ",

Given bitcoin's clear deflationary properties, I don't see it being used as a primary medium of exchange. The promise of bitcoin is libertarian with hints of anarchy thrown in by some if its more fervent supporters, but government will never cease to exist. Groups of people will always organize and compete against one another to consolidate political power. My guess is that governments will ultimately issue their own cryptocurrencies (with all the inevitable abuse that will come), while the reserve currencies that emerge as such will remain decentralized and help facilitate transactions between nations. Moving fiat around is so incredibly inefficient and expensive right now, which is why I believe there is so much potential for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to add real value in our lives.

Not entirely sure how accurate these sources are, I know coinmarketcap does a pretty reasonable job in averaging the Bitcoin prices among all the exchanges while taking a greater account at the larger exchanges. Bitcoin unlike a stock will never have a definitive price...but it should be within -+5% among all exchanges. That recent BitForex fiasco where prices were absurdly higher than Coinbase was an anomaly. The reason I ask is that I still have trouble grasping the peak crypto market cap of $830 bill in Jan. 2018. We\u2019re at $209 bill now. Where did that $620 billion go? Nearly 2/3s of a trillion vanished out of thin air. That\u2019s what scary about Bitcoin but also details it\u2019s potential. I was convinced the total market cap was going to surpass $1 trillion in Jan...but I am beyond certain it will surpass $1 trill in the next big bull run. Basically, I don\u2019t know whether to second guess the price sources or to believe that Bitcoin is extremely volatile to pumps-and-dumps leading to 100s of billion being wiped out at the blink of an eye...",

            "Text": "This is why completely 'replacing' the dollar is likely lifetimes away. Bitcoin/Litecoin etc. could easily become mainstream currency, but it has to be bench marked. So, if a mortgage/loan is agreed upon and amortization is settled, it would be in terms of whatever amount of Bitcoin will equal the amount of dollars required for the monthly payment.\n\nBitcoin running alongside of current FIAT structure is the only way to transition to a cryptocurrency economy and that transition would take many years. The solutions to issues of the future are not created yet, so naturally we don't think about them as we will once they materialize. As an example, many perspectives of the future of media storage when CDs and DVD disks were mainstream, was that the future would be tiny disks lol! Nobody thought in terms of SSD drives and streaming! In the same way, it's really difficult to see how a constant value will be determined in a Bitcoin economy, but I have no doubt we will find a way.",

            "Text": "Interesting question. Have you ever wondered why houses increase in value over time? Why should your house be worth more after 30 years than it was when you first built it? Just about everything else gets less valuable as it gets older.\n\nThere are lots of factors that push home prices up and down, but one factor that consistently pushes home prices up is devaluation of money. People need to live somewhere, and money gets less valuable every year, so home prices tend to increase, especially over a long time frame - like a 30 year mortgage.\n\nAs long as people value bitcoin in relation to their national currency, bitcoin will continue to go up. When we someday reach a bitcoin economy, people won't think in terms of dollar values anymore. Now, imagine that bitcoin mortgage scenario again. Let's say a lender wants to finance your house at a 5% interest rate. The house costs 100 BTC and you're paying for it over 100 months. You pay the lender 1.05 BTC each month until it's paid off. When you've paid off the mortgage, the house is still worth 100 BTC and you've paid the lender 5 BTC for the loan. Easy peasy.",

Deflation is a lot worse than the low single-digit inflation government central banks try to maintain (so long as they can). Sure, the purchasing power of your money will erode over time under those conditions, but money needs those properties otherwise you would get very little growth in the economy. Just look at Japan. People have a lot less incentive to put their money to work when they can increase their purchasing power by stuffing cash under the mattress. ",

Considering the population, how much it's growing and how fast the percentage of the current population is moving into digital use... Bitcoin's measly 21 million coins would have to divided among billions of people. Thus, the value of Bitcoin would explode into highs not even imagined by the most outrageous predictions put forward. This is why IMO, Bitcoin is much more suited to a store of value, investment asset and alternative currency that can be used to make large transactions. One day sure, it may be a viable currency once the deflation slows, but I would think Litecoin or some other alt would be the currency medium that delivers value to and from the main bank of bitcoin value that any individual or organization owns.   \nA digital currency economy is very likely to occur sooner than later, and Bitcoin has an enormous head start in terms of network proof of stability, security and accuracy.

He's now fully paid in the currency that he just spent.\n\nIf I'm using bitcoin I would need:\n\n\\- A balance that's not locked in an exchange or in cold storage\n\n\\- A friend who is willing to accept bitcoin (to replace USD that he just spent) and doesn't need this money in at least 2 weeks (assuming he will need to transfer to an exchange, sell it, and wait for the exchange to transfer USD to his bank)\n\nIn a world where everyone is using bitcoin for everything all the time, maybe it's easier, but in the world we're living in it just adds unnecessary steps for really no advantages.",

You're analyzing a single spoke of a wheel that solves a much larger problem.\n\n- Apple Pay simple works as a digital medium for a currency that has already been established. That's not as impressive as one may think.\n\n- I've said multiple times, Bitcoin as a mainstream currency would take generations if at all.\n\n- Try sending huge payments to another country with Apple Pay for the costs of a few pennies, including the conversion of currency.\n\n- What about the investment asset aspect? Store of value? Global acceptance? Network value? \n\n- The first cars in 1770 were horrible and did not hold a candle to horses... they couldn't move as fast, go nearly as many places, and even as cars were improved they required an entire new ecosystem of roads to interconnect main locations. They weren't dinosaurs compared to horses, they were the beginning of something that was not replaced, but rather, improved ongoing.\nBitcoin also requires an entire ecosystem to be built before its true value can be realized.",
