            "Text": "Bitcoin continues to bounce off it's cost floor, looking for a reason to go up. Demand is still primarily driven by speculators, although they are long-term (1-5 years) speculators rather than day traders (as I believe we saw at the beginning of 2018). These speculators are accumulating BTC at what they believe is close to cost.\n\nLet me explain my rationale (please comment):\n\nIf you want to acquire BTC legally, you must either trade for it or mine it. Creating mining infrastructure, getting licensed, hiring staff to administer machines, paying the costs on the debt to acquire facilities, hardware and electricity are all significant. Recovering your initial investment (getting your BTC) by mining BTC is typically a year or more. [If the cost of mining a BTC is in the range of $6,000.00](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-a-single-bitcoin-in-your-country-2018-03-06), then buying it on the market for a comparable price is better - faster, easier & lower risk.\n\nInvestors have been plowing vast sums of money into mining BTC and the BTC [hashrate has been climbing steadily](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate). As the BTC hashrate continues to climb, the cost of mining BTC will climb as well. If the price of mining a BTC in April in China was $3,172.00 and the hashrate has increased from 27,000,000 TH/s to 53,000,000 TH/s since then, you could imagine that the cost of mining as increased by 50-100% as well. At this point, it is likely that the market price of BTC is close to the average cost of mining BTC.\n\nWhen the market price of BTC is close enough to the cost of mining, the investors who are trying to accumulate BTC at the lowest cost will stop investing in mining and will instead buy BTC on the market, which has the effect of increasing demand and driving the price up. When the market price reaches the point where a longer-term mining investment yields more BTC for a given price than market purchases, those investors stop buying BTC and instead put their money back into mining. This has the effect of reducing demand and causes the price to drop.\n\nIf you believe that BTC offers a technically superior alternative to a store-of-value asset like Gold and therefore will not become valueless, then you should be comfortable buying BTC at it's cost of production. It's cost of production is rising steadily, however, as illustrated by the hashrate growth trend.\n\nI believe that there is a very good chance that the current market value of BTC is close to its cost of production and investor capital is likely to sustain these prices. I do not believe that we are likely to see prices drop much below this level, and if so only briefly (hours, not days).\n\nI also believe that it is likely that price appreciation will track closely to the rate of increase in the hashrate of the network, until BTC is more directly integrated with more external economies. This integration with external economies will serve to somewhat decouple the price of BTC from trading behavior, because more transactions will be driven by the opportunity cost of the economic activity that is being facilitated by a given transaction.\n\nMore BTC transactions being executed based on time-sensitive economic events other than mere fluctuations in the market price of BTC will have a stabilizing effect. Today, the opportunity cost of a BTC purchase (to most speculators) is merely the cost of debt, and they can execute their trades whenever they are comfortable with the BTC price. It's a game of 'chicken' between speculators. When more BTC transactions are being executed for things like purchases of major assets, repayment or purchase of debt instruments, investments in businesses or payment of taxes, (and so forth) then the behavior of the markets will change as well - it will become less volatile and greater demand will lead to more consistent appreciation.\n\nFurther, this appreciation will also directly lead to still more price stability and appreciation. As the total global wealth stored as BTC increases (the so-called 'market cap') the ability of individual actors (funds, private investors, individual exchanges) to alter the market price by mass purchases/dumps will also diminish - there will simply be fewer and fewer actors able to move capital at the scale necessary to deliberately, dramatically affect market prices.\n\nWith all this in mind, I am accumulating BTC and I am bullish for 2019. As for 2018, it remains to be seen where we will go, but we should expect it to be choppy.\n\nADDED: For the record, I think 'Technical Analysis' is complete BS and is a waste of time. It has no proven predictive power at all and is a silly pseudoscience. I disregard all price predictions based on TA, without exception. People who talk about \"support\" and \"resistance\" or \"descending wedges\" are full of crap. Do some statistical analysis of TA and you'll immediately see what I mean.",

            "Text": "DCA is the way to go. Daily if feasible. Then you cheer every day like today like you do if your neighbourhood shop hold a discount sale for a short period. Then your buy price hugs the curve tightly and you land in green within a very short period of recovering from the bottom. Just like how DCA hodlers starting at the Dec 2013 peak were in the green from Nov 2015 - just three months after the bottom. If you started DCA in Dec 2017, your average purchase price at the moment is around $7.8k so you could be in the green within weeks or even days. Brutal bear market throughout the year?\n\nDCA makes you enjoy the volatility rather than frustrate you.",

            "Text": "Nice theory but you have one small flaw in it. What utility does BTC have other than a store of wealth? The only thing driving demand for BTC is speculation. There are solutions emerging that utilise blockchain concepts that will likely prove useful and therefore valuable but the concept that BTC specifically is valuable because it is valuable is just odd.\n\nBTC is an interesting experiment in human greed and psychology but unless you use BTC is protect you from the weather, feed you, transport you etc etc then it has no real purpose. The only potential use was as a currency but it has already failed at that. Plus the concept of a global currency is crazy because localised currency is an important factor is market control and insulation. People seem to think Venezuela or Turkey prove the value of BTC but in reality is just shows the danger. Just look at Greece and the EU for examples of how having a common currency was part of the problem rather than part of the solution. ",

No way we can adapt, adopt, evolve, advance? We are doomed to digging up rocks and putting them back into the ground with name tags on contracts that say we own a piece of something we'll NEVER actually see or hold or smell or touch? Wait a minute.... oh hey there's this thing called bitcoin that provides a similar but superior accounting system, backed by redundancy and perfect math. Maybe you've heard of it? Maybe a newer, smarter generation will shift towards this as opposed to continuing to dig up and store these heavy rocks for eternity! ...just a thought, maybe I'm crazy :)",

Any other accompanying utility is just added benefit but will not compensate for any lacunae in the primary use case of 'store of value '.\n\nIf you doubt that Bitcoin acts well as a store of value tell me please how you could store wealth securely in a way that is unconfiscateable and involves no physical storage and costs negligible to transport anywhere across the world in minutes. Add to this where the supply cannot be manipulated by any govt or event. And where the item in question does not decay over time or get physically damaged. And where the item is infinitesmally divisible with no inconvenience.\n\nThis has been an important use case to humanity from time immemorial.\n\nBefore you say 'any crypto', think hard what securely means. \n\nAs for the criteria you have listed, bitcoin is difficult to acquire (being strictly limited in supply) and impossible to destroy. Possibility of losing keys or getting hacked is not a counterargument as gold too can get stolen. As for your third criteria, I have argued above that no additional demand via some other utility is necessary for something that performs the 'store of value' usecase well.",

You can copy or 'fork' lots of open source projects, go to town on it ... that doesn't make it worth anything.\nAsk any company how much a stable, secure and redundant network is worth to them? Bitcoin took ten years to provide confidence in its network - ten years of never being compromised. In this technical age of data, that hold a great deal of value and its the mining nodes and code contributors that make this all possible. Why do you think the number of coders on the bitcoin network have tripped in just the past year? You won't see that in a fork, lol.",
