I actually can't pay most of the employees in checks because they are constantly traveling because it's a shipping business. Those employees that I can pay with checks are often in remote areas in Alaska where it can take a week for the mail to arrive. Also, if you think that direct deposit is the obvious solution then you're right, but only for the normal payroll. If for some reason we need to pay an employee outside the normal payroll, then we have to manually push it through the bank using a template so that it can go through the clearing house process. To put it into perspective how bad this process is, after I entered an ACH payment in on Thursday it did not process the direct deposit until Monday morning because I missed the 5pm deadline.",

Then it peaked and people started leaving as they grew concerned they would lose their money. That massive pool of buyers (including my little sister, a total technophobe) are still leaving. There's a lot of room for the price to deflate.\n\nBitcoin can't moon unless new blood becomes interested. Unfortunately part of the reason it mooned last year was the narrative that Bitcoin has only ever gone up making it a sure bet. I think this new track record of major prolonged devaluation is going to slow things up a bit. People are afraid to get burned.",

            "Text": "**Loss aversion**\n\nIn cognitive psychology and decision theory, loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. The principle is very prominent in the domain of economics. What distinguishes loss aversion from risk aversion is that the utility of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
