            "Text": "OK So I have a question. I have a ledger S, and some funds (not much at all) on Coinbase. Now I'm starting to think about how to keep the gov't out of my business. I'm not some drug lord, or some industrial miner. However, I think I have previously sent money from my Coinbase (with all it's KYC crap) directly to the Nano's address.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes that mean if any gov't was to pry into my affairs, they would forever associate that Nano S address as probably belonging to me? I know one can use \"coin mixers\" to have one's coins mixed up with other peoples and then sent on to wherever, perhaps I should have done that in the first place. Is it too late to remove the link between my coinbase and my nano accounts?",

There's nothing the authorities can do because there's simply no regulation and no real identity to match with Satoshi so there's no real evidence that he is actually impersonating someone, for all we know Satoshi Nakamoto could be a group of people.  So it's definitely a grey area when it comes to the authorities but for us we can simply see through his lies and over time it will come down on him.",

            "Text": "Not sure why it would bother you. Blockchains don't scale and the logic for a smaller blocksize is fairly sound. While it will likely never see a consensus, the discussion itself is valuable in that it keeps the subject where it should be - the ever expansive resource usage required by nodes. It's unsustainable. More than that, bringing these problems continually to the forefront of discussion will help keep at arms length larger blocks which would further exacerbate the problem. These are important technical discussions which would otherwise not be in the average Bitcoin users mind at all.\n\nHate him all you want, there have been a couple times now Luke has been the villain we need. I don't always agree with him but I do respect that he has a role to play in this community.",
