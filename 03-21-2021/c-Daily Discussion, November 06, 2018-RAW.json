They still control a shit ton of hashrate, and, while they can't do much to manipulate BTC with it anymore, they can definitly use it to cash in on greedy cryptonerds who believe they can make quick money on that fork. \n\nIn any case, BCH has been slowly dieing off for months. What will happen soon will probably finish it off. Good timing for Ver to empty his BCH bags too and get back on BTC, claiming he now has seen the light following the fiasco of the BCH fork, transfering a large influx of money from BCH to BTC, so that he can make some mad profit on the incoming bull market. He probably expect bakkt to start the FOMO, but I expect his own huge investment in BTC and his following \"apology, I am back on BTC, I was wrong!\" video to actually start the next bullrun.",

I can't see any way for Bitmain to not get what they want since they'll have 1million on any BCH fork (unless they blacklist his coins in the HF). So I'd imagine this pump is largely Bitmain pumping up BCH to bring in more miners to decrease the hashshare of CSW and Ayres pools.\n\nIt has the side effect of riding off the air-drop fomo; and if there ends of being a fork Bitmain can just dump the side(s) they don't like and pump it into the fork they want to preserve.\n\nIn the end; isn't it in the interest of producers of mining tools to have more assets that can be mined with those tools? If you were selling shovels it would be awfully convenient if you could also create mountains filled with veins of valuable ore.\n\nI think we are going to see the profit motive push the forks to the limit. What is the smallest hashshare before 51% becomes likely? It would be interesting and useful to see how/when this plays out.",

            "Text": "Greenie here.  Look, entirely disregarding climate science or just being an ass about it isn't going to win you any points from me.  Most folks still don't give a shit about climate change anyway - look at how much it's discussed in politics - almost never.  AI and nukes no one cares about either, which are even hairier issues.  \n  \nThere are several good counter arguments that could actually persuade someone, here are a few:  \n  \n1.  All industries use energy to make a profit - most are dirtier energy than Bitcoin.  We don't tend to rail on them.  \n  \n2.  Bitcoin's demand for energy is a huge boon for renewable energy - finally the world's hydro projects are actually getting used close to capacity - remote and aging wind farms have co-located customers now which reduces the need to maintain expensive long distance, high power transmission lines, etc.  This increases the base demand and profitability for these projects.  Most renewable energy projects are massive, long-term affairs.  New installations will have increased profitability and viability going forward.  \n  \n3.  The economics of Bitcoin as a sound money encourage saving when possible.  Fiat discourages it by constantly and unpredictably inflating it.  The only reason for McMansions and overheated stock prices are that they suck less than other savings vehicles - Bitcoin can change that.  Now we can actually save money without having to blow it on shit we don't need, or CEOs or bankers that are going to extort or scam us.  This is great from a greenie perspective because its more efficient and less wasteful.  \n  \n4.  The benefits of frictionless sound money to enable world trade give power back to regular people.  It's more and more going to expose  the ridiculous asshole governments of places like Venezuela as absurd and backwards.  Actually all trade friction and monetary controls are going to start appearing in the same light.  This is a boon for humanity and the temporary energy cost (still benefiting renewables) is worth the cost in my opinion.  \n  \nJust one more thought - I'm looking forward to seeing how alternative consensus algorithms work out.  I'm not ideologically opposed to PoS, but I haven't seen an implementation yet that I would trust my savings to.  I like that PoW is game theoretic and mathematically provably secure.  Right now, it's the best we've got.",

            "Text": "Great - I can relate to that sentiment and had very much the same view up until I read 'The Bitcoin Standard.'  I can safely say that it reversed my views on the subject by about 95%.  Saifedean Ammous covers a lot of historical examples and data that absolutely destroy the Keynesian economic theory.  \n  \nBy the way, Keynes was essentially an arrogant privileged dude with no background in economics who sold a load of shit to governments.  They found it politically expedient at the time to receive free money to finance and repay war debt.  \n  \nAnyway, Ammous presents plenty of data to support the notion that sounds money encourages a longer term view, which makes the world more prosperous in general.  Keynesian inflation and economics only benefits the economy in the short term and can be very detrimental to the world economy over longer time-spans.  Not only that, but centralized planning and control of local interest rates creates enormous boom bust cycles, with very little feedback mechanism for self-correction unlike the system we had during sound (inflation limited) money.  \n  \nSeriously, find a copy of the book - it's quite enlightening.",

Before the pump, 93% of the world sha256 is mining bitcoin and 7% mining bch. Now bch has about 9%.\n\nSo you may ask why bch need more hash power? well this is because one of their leaders (Csw) threatened to fuck up the opposing chain upon the fork. Csw allegedly control about 43% hash of bch. Without new hash power he will take over bch easy",

Nor would I venture to say that \"the price of Bitcoin will be $100k-$200k 3-6 years from now; not hype just facts\"\n\nIts all speculation.",
