I know I\u2019m just old man Crytogrip who tries to hype up excitement in the crypto world when it was obviously dead all year, but I feel you lied to me. Bakkt, I know you\u2019re not a real tangible thing - merely an abstract idea that comes in form of Bitcoin futures but I believed in you. My heart is broken and I know I must hide in the Bitcoin subreddit since I have lost total credibility. I know Jesus rose from the dead on the third day, but I believe you Bakkt will rise from the death in the 6th month. I am old man Crytogrip and I believe in urban myth.",

Bitcoin works well with Litecoin, because Litecoin can test things like confidential transactions, and if it\u2019s successful it can be implemented into Bitcoin. Ethereum has a place too for things like CryptoKitties, decentralized finance (like MakerDAO and Dai), and other useful dapps. All of which, by the way, help bring people into the cryptocurrency space which weren\u2019t there before. Anyone can buy a CryptoKitty and sell it at a higher price, and decide to keep profits in BTC. It all works together nicely, and the Bitcoin community should be happy about the achievements of other cryptocurrencies.",
