The best part? We don't need Coinbase to go Segwit to get it working. Once the testnet app is sufficiently complete, they can turn it on for mainnet and we're ready to go.\n\nA new day is dawning.",

Could the current small dip (10:22 am EST) be due to large investors trying to drive the market down to then buy back in at a lower point in anticipation of futures starting tonight?\n2. Why would trading on GDAX be difficult to make small profits on? I completely understand HODL but I also have some that I want to play around with just to get oriented. With the rather large swings day to day, shouldn't it be fairly easy to, for example, buy at $19,500 then sell at $19,700. Wait  for it to dip to $19,600, buy back in, then sell again at $19,900. That seems easy to do from watching all the charts on GDAX. Is it just the time it takes for the order to fill that throws a wrench into this line of thinking?\n\nAnyway thanks in advance for feedback and soul crushing burns.",

As soon as there is resistance everyone fears the worst and pulls out.  \n\nThe market is just balancing itself out you have to look at longer market trends than 24 hours..... Unless you are daytrading you shouldn't react to a 5% retraction when it grew 12% over the last 7 days and only 150% for the month... (sarcasm)\n\nThese parabolic moves are unsustainable therfore, it needs to stabilize before it makes a bull or bear move...\n\nIf you lost money already then your entry was poor and you didn't understand the market.  Before investing again I would review my strategy and review what happened in the market during my holding time. \n\n",

Do I just say cost basis is $0, or the cost basis should include some electricity and computer costs? or is that like $20 max which is almost $0 so I should just ignore that?\n\n2) Any creative ways to legally avoid the capital gains? \nNothing illegal like \"sell to a friend and don't report\" or \"just spend the bitcoin on things on dell/newegg\". I was thinking I could give it to my son/daughter and they could sell it, claim capital gains as their own and since its only $5000 they probably would get a $0 tax bill? I tried to make a Gemini account for my daughter and they needed her state ID or passport which she doesn't have. Can I sell it on her behalf and just show the IRS that I moved it into a UTMA account? Anyone else do things like this?",

Not having to wait 2 days for a wire or longer for an ACH is a very strong feature of Coinbase for which one pays heavily in fees.  I understand parking money ahead of time is preferable, but there are times like right after Pay day where I\u2019d like to use the money to buy right away. I cannot find anywhere else that does the same at all, let alone at a cheaper rate and so I\u2019ve come to the mountain top to ask. Thank you in advance. ",

Just like CB failing to handle the volume today, its website would frequently crash during frenzies which could induce a panic sell event. very few called the top back then",

Also the run up was fueled by the Willy bot on a single exchange (mt gox) not by actual new influx of users. Now we have reliable exchanges scattered around the world, big volumes, big new influx of users and good coverage. I still think this can get nasty and that most new users are not used to the panic and violent moves bitcoin can deliver so we will see what happens if we start a decent correction.",

Gdax is like a farmer's market where people in your community gather and sell things to each other.  Coinbase is that guy that goes to the farmers market and puts farmers market items in their convenience store and jacks up the price to you for the convenience of not going to the market yourself.\n\nThe only difference is that since this is all digital.. coinbase doesnt have to run to the market and buy in bulk every once in awhile.  They can go and buy your order instantly when you ask for it in the convenience store.",

THey stop posting on all teh various forums and they wait.  Then once Bitcoiners have attracted a lot of newbies to the space, they attack again in full force.  To the newbie it appears genuine, organic.  Hes just bought something he doens't understand and now the bridge is collapsing. The poor soul sells at a loss.

You really need to store any serious value paper wallets in a safe and in multiple locations in case of fire.\n\nHardware wallets improve this by having PIN protection with automatic wiping of the device if you enter too many wrong PINs. However, storing the restoration keywords on paper aren't much better than a paper wallet unless you have a photographic memory or a cypher or split storage method you can trust with your partner or family.\n\nHardware wallets seem to be the way to go at the moment.\n\nThere are some new options like \"cryptosteel\" from Ledger but it's starting to get a little silly and we are just moving the point of security failure around.",

            "Text": "The three basic types:\n\nMarket buy: I want to buy now for the lowest available price.  You will be buying from the people who have posted limit sells, meaning you will be removing liquidity. \n\nLimit Buy: you are not immediately buying, you are saying that you would be willing to buy X amount if the price reaches Y.  For a buy, this will be lower than the current market price and for a sell this would be higher than the current market price.  In a lot of places limit orders have no fee since they add liquidity.\n\nStop: this is a way to trigger a buy or sell if the price reaches a certain level.  For example, you could place a \"stop sell\" at $18000 so as soon as that price hits you would initiate a market sell. The down side of this is that temporary dips or manipulation can trigger this sell, and you'd be selling at the bottom.  \n\nPlaying around on GDAX, looking at the recent transactions, and browsing the depth chart should make limits pretty obvious! The sell and buy walls on the depth chart are all \"limits\" ",

            "Text": "You\u2019re better off selling to me at $15k rather than living with all this stress and uncertainty.\n\nBut really you need to do some research and learn a bit about the dangers inherent in stop loss sales. They do certainly have a good and useful purpose but they are not \u201cguaranteed\u201d and can also cause an undesirable effect in a volitale market where a \u201cflash crash\u201d triggers your auto sale but moments later the price climbs right back up.  Whales and market manipulators use these automated sells to there advantage. Small minnows like me look at it as an opportunity to buy on sale.\n\nTake a look at the last couple weeks of BTC charts... and be sure to zoom in on details. Count the number of times your $15k stop loss sale might have been triggered and ask yourself if you really would have wanted that to happen seeing how things progressed over a few days time.\n\nAs an example, a week ago there was major volatility around the CBOE futures start. BTC dipped into the mid $13k range.  Likewise, if a similar dip occurs with CME futures starting (just minutes ago), I would/will buy as much as I could at $15k.\n\nWhen you set an auto-sell for stop loss, you need to be comfortable in knowing that if it successfully triggers then you sold at that value *regardless* of what happens to the market thereafter.  Yes, if you auto-sell at $15k during a legitimate massive crash and BTC stabilizes at a price significantly below $15k, then you\u2019ve protected yourself from additional losses.  If you think that scenario is likely, then an auto-sell might be appropriate protection (but it\u2019s not guaranteed). Likewise if a dip chases your stop loss sale to trigger and BTC stabilizes back above $15k, then you need to be comfortable in giving a buyer a nice deal.",

I'm looking now at this thread\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/\nVery interesting and informative stuff.\nYour point about new coinbase applicants rings true as I know someone who cannot get verified still after almost a week of trying.\nI'll think a little more and research more as you suggest before I commit to anything :)",

I also thought it would have been 25k as I believe many others did.  Looking at the price of 19616 it. I would assume you bought 16 hours ago or 27 hours ago. \n\nIf that's so then you would had seen the resistance in the exchanges and the wall stacked at the 20k threshold.  When you look at the exchange you can see how many sells are set at a given price.  Last night there was around 1.2k btc sitting around that 20k mark.\n\nThat was a sign of resistance and would have taken either a whale purchase or a large volume increase. Neither of which happened and therefore resistance held.\n\nThe people that hold large outs of btc are more than likely financially savvy and day trade.  I would recommend looking into basic stock trading strategies",

There may be some going all-in, but that's a terrible decision with any commodity or market at any time in history, no one can predict the future.  People tend to behave the MOST rationally out of any of their decision making when it comes to their money, so I can't figure there are that many behaving that way.  For example I am a newcomer, started playing last week at 15,800, and have already set up a plan for buys every pay period that are worthwhile but entirely insignificant towards my total budget.  I would imagine most of the newcomers are closer to that mark, which is great for the market.",

I have a problem with how they positioned themselves and tried to influence the whole segwit2x fiasco.\n\nThat being said... If you are looking to take donations or receive crypto funds and want to turn it into fiat they are probably your best and maybe only choice if you want it as automated as possible and want the conversation to fiat to be instant.  You of course could just setup a BTC wallet and exchange it on quadrigacx or coinsquare for fiat, but you would have to be transferring an executing the trades manually.  Something like bitpay is the way to go of you want a similiar experience to how accepting debit or credit cards is.  It's also likely the easiest sales pitch to your treasurer and board of directors because it will be seen as the safest option in the event that BTC devalues from the time it's received to the time it's converted to CAD.

            "Text": "Do you plan to sell it or to store it for later?\n\nIf you plan to sell right away I'd use something like Kraken or livecoin.\nI've heard Kraken is easier to get your money off of while livecoin is easier to convert, buy and sell in real time.\nAnyway BEFORE you receive the coins, sign up for kraken, connect your bank account and activate 2fa. (2fa just means you have to supply 2 ways to prove you are you, and it helps to ensure no one impersonates you and steals your money. These might be your email, cellphone or a pin number) You may then need to wait a few days depending on their rules. Since you are a newb they may tell you you have to wait for a certain amount of time before you can withdraw. Wait for that time, then when ready to receive your coins, the site will give you a special secret code. Give this to the angel who is giving you the coins. They will send you the coins in approx 2-10minutes. Once it arrives, immediately convert to USD and send to bank account. DO NOT DELAY.\n\nIf you plan to sell sometime but not exactly soon, I'd put it in Electrum.\n\nIf you plan to save it, I'd invest in a Trezor or Ledger Nano S, bought directly from the official sites. (approx $150 and $100 respectively. (These are like USB flashdrives which they'll ship to you and are one of the safest ways to store your Bitcoins if you don't want them stolen.)\nTake the trezor directly to the angel and ask if they would put the coins on it. They will likely be very impressed you got the trezor.\nOne thing to note: when you first use it, Trezor may give you a \"seed\" which is basically a series of random words. That's a secret code that will allow you to keep your coins even if you lose or break the trezor. You must write this down and make sure you NEVER lose it. If you lose the code you WILL be sorry.\n\nOne more thing: do NOT put and leave your coins on anything that is called an \"exchange.\" those are not safe websites. You will likely get hacked and lose your coins.\n\nThis is a very watered down explanation but one i wish I'd had when I started. If anyone sees any errors please do correct them.\n(I use cold storage because I have no intent to sell my knowledge of the warmer options may be less accurate.)",

It is very complex and takes a long time to get good through a combination of: theoretical study, study of empirical evidence, and real life experience of the stress involved. Some of the smartest people in this world are recruited straight from undergrad and dedicate themselves to the science and art of trading.  Now previously you were limited by your body.  Now with computers, 1 trader can multiply his moves dramatically through all sorts of mechanisms. \n\nNow, there are plenty of newbies too and you only need to be better than the \"average trader\" theoretically (based on volume and less in certain corner cases).  But aside all that, just don't trade.\n\nUse GDAX to make your buys & sells and use cold storage. Hodl until you have life needs for spending.

Stated simply: By hodling you are actually likely to earn a greater return than trying to \"time\" an unregulated market.\n\nA bit longer: Bitcoin is inherently valuable. We are in the price discovery stage. It is a bootstrapping process. There are many speculators. You can try to daytrade, but likely you are going to get eaten by exchange fees and whales making coordinate moves in an unregulated market. If you understand it is inherently valuable and will eventually reach its true value (for many this is much higher than todays price), then you should simply hold onto your coins and not trade. In that way, you are likely not to miss out on coordinate by buys by whales, etc.",
