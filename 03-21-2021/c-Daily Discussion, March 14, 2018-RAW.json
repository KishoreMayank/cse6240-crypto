But after the 1,400 percent rally of 2017, with wild swings along the way, the great crypto craze has cooled, at least for now. For the past month, Bitcoin\u2019s price has stalled between $8,500 and $11,300 -- a minuscule range by its standards. And internet searches for \u201cBitcoin\u201d have plunged, suggesting public interest has, too.\n\n> \u201cThe general public is now realizing that this is not a risk-free, get-rich-quick, investment opportunity and general interest has since diminished,\u201d said Lucas Nuzzi, a senior analyst at Digital Asset Research.\n\n> Online searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d fell 82 percent from December highs, according to Google Trends. Tweets that mention the coin peaked Dec. 7, at 155,600, and are now down to about 63,000, BitInfoCharts says. And the number of bitcoin transactions is off 60 percent from its record on Dec. 13, according to Blockchain.info.\n\n> December brought \u201cBitcoin Craze Propels Coinbase App to No. 1 in Apple\u2019s Store.\u201d Now there\u2019s \u201cBitcoin\u2019s Wildest Days Are Over as Regulators Circle.\u201d Indeed, Bitcoin\u2019s been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately.\n\n> Its price slumped Wednesday after Google said it would prohibit cryptocurrency ads, following Facebook\u2019s move from January. Major banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America banned crypto purchases on their credit cards, the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up cryptocurrency oversight and Congress is holding hearings on how to treat the digital coins. Earlier this month, Allianz Global Investors argued the the coin\u2019s \u201cintrinsic value must be zero.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe story with Bitcoin is pretty straightforward,\u201d said Roger Kay, president of research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. \u201cIt went up fast, and then came down even faster. Consumers who flocked to it late got burned. They are in the shadows now, licking their wounds. And others contemplating how to get rich quick are acutely aware that what goes up can come down, and maybe Bitcoin isn\u2019t the way to go about it.\u201d\n\n[Source]\n (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/bitcoin-pop-culture-moment-fades-as-fad-gives-way-to-regulators)",

            "Text": "This is a comment I'm quoting from someone who commented on a Coindesk article.  Curious on peoples thoughts.  I agree that if true they can only bring down the market so far.\n\n\"Options market closes at the end of the trading day Eastern time today March 14. They (Killer Whales, owners of the option exchange, and MTGox trustee) always short the options market and they have the control (bitcoin) to manipulate the market. Adoption is at about 9500, so they (the options controllers) have purposely gambled the price to a short using the option funds to pay for their losses. (They raised the margin to 44% to increase the ability to short deeper and still not lose.) But one thing is for sure, the Killer Whales have a LOT of bitcoin and cannot afford to CRASH the market. Fear selling below 8300 to 8500 will present incredible buy opportunities for the big guys or those in the know. I personally bought in at 8800 and will wait for what I believe will be the next two week run up toward 12K. This is my personal SWAG and individuals should not invest funds they cannot afford to burn. I am not a financial consultant and any risk should be based on your own due diligence\"",

            "Text": "Well, this is interesting. Have a look at the market [momentum](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aSRn1K4Z/), which is one of the few indicators I tend to trust. See anything unusual? The sell momentum after the price increase has lost strength. Meaning that people / bots / whatever have been selling *less* than before even though the price has been basically the same between the two momentum periods. In short, it looks like buyers have surprisingly regained some trust in the market in the last hour. So there's a high chance $8000 is actually today's bottom. We'll see.",

Google and Facebook are probably concerned about their own stocks after the stock market plunged and I don't doubt that the fact they banned bitcoin ads has something to do with that. Do I really understand how buying a coin helps the technology behind it if it's already created and ready to be used? NO. Do I believe it has benefits? I want to. Now.. if you want the technology to survive and thrive so the value goes up. Don't try to milk every dollar. Hold. Because you are killing bitcoin.",

We went from 10.6 to well under 10k in a minute candle on GDAX from a huge market sell. All drops since have been 1000+ coin market sells that have tanked the price. It's not a bear market, it is people trying to drive the price down. Look at the sell wall going up? Thin as hell. Price spikes back up as buying pressure is there but then big market sell to a lower low. Been happening now for the past week. Once we break up again I think we should see $12k+. ",

Not amongst those of us who have been here for years - but amongst your average joe. \n\nAnd that matters more than anything. Without that sweet FOMO money we aren\u2019t going to see 20k again regardless of how good the fundamentals are. \n\nLightning? Yeah cool. Sadly until people can use it to buy their Venti Frappuccino at Starbucks - it won\u2019t really matter in terms of moving the price upwards. \n\nBitcoin rocketed in the fall because people thought they could get rich quick when they saw how it paid off for people who held through the years where nobody even knew what a bitcoin was. The moment it clicked that investing AFTER it went mainstream was nowhere near as profitable and much riskier - money exited fast. \n\nInb4 \u201cprice doesn\u2019t matter\u201d bois ",

There are patterns that cause responses from traders, but it isn't that simple, and it certainly does go up after it's been flat for some time. Honestly, one thing that does show which direction things might go is whether there is low order volume ahead or behind for about $100 to $200. That usually is too attractive for someone with a lot of coin. Resistance builds up in either direction either from those trying to day trade or from those who were looking to either get in or get out at a better price and who have gone in on an order.",

We\u2019ll see in due time which securities people run to when the economy gets ran into the ground by overheating of the market, debt and inflation. It might not happen this year, the next  or 5 yrs. but it is going to happen. There is absolutely NO way that the path the world has gone down will end up as a good scenario. I know I sound apocalyptic but the reality is that we cannot sustain printing fiat for trade that really has little to no value. It would take substantial reform to turn the current trajectory around. Which people that live comfortable lives that don\u2019t really care will not tolerate major reform to save everyone\u2019s asses and by the way I pay my taxes on crypto so as far as I am concerned they can try and crush btc and run it underground. But there\u2019s people like me that actually see it as a real security. I do have a red line however and will sell all my crypto if it reaches a certain low to preserve earnings.",

People sell Bitcoin for Tether when it's at a high point, say $11,000 USDT, and then they wait for the value of Bitcoin to go down and then they buy more Bitcoin with the tether they have. They just day trade using Tether to avoid paying taxes. I don't understand why you're bringing up cash. You can't buy Tether with USD as far as I know. \nThe reason they print Tether is because the demand for tether goes up.. when demand goes up, they have to increase the supply so that the price will remain relatively the same.

            "Text": ">Why is that?\n\nBecause dumb money is easily confused and frightened. Just as fast as people latched onto the dream that they would get rich overnight - they quickly realized they could also lose everything overnight. So panic kicked in and they began exiting with the little profit (or losses) they made. \n\nSmart money knows that things move in cycles - dumb money thought Bitcoin would skyrocket upwards forever. Dumb money always gets stung. Smart money took profits when the writing was on the wall that the price was parabolic and unsustainable. \n\n>when will it come back in\n\nThe long answer is when it has a reason to. Right now all the average person knows about Bitcoin is that \"it crashed\" - even though technically it's way up from this time in 2017. But specifics don't matter, perception is reality. In late 2017 money poured in because the perception was that Bitcoin would make you rich quick - and that was partly true granted you knew when to get while the getting was good. Now the perception is less optimistic - it generally ranges from \"Bitcoin is dead\" to \"Bitcoin tanked!\" or \"I told you it was a scam\"\n\nThese are not the type of buzzwords that generate FOMO money.\n\nThe short answer? In a month. In 6 months. In 2 years. Maybe never. ",

Save your MUH YOU JUST DONT GET IT - I get it believe me. I've probably been involved in Bitcoin longer than you (think early days). \n\nBut this idea that purchasing power of an asset doesn't matter is ludicrous. Absolute nonsense. \n\nIf the dollar collapsed tomorrow and we had to use BTC to pay for things - how would we price things? If person A charged 5 bitcoins for a loaf of bread - and person B charged 1 bitcoin - would you buy from A or B? Why?\n\nHow would we attach a price to anything unless we determine a value of the commodity we use to purchase it? We would have to agree that the commodity had purchasing power. Now if I stripped that commodity of all purchasing power overnight you wouldn't mind? How would you use it to pay for anything then?\n\nIt's the same thing on a less extreme scale now with a USD amount attached to it. \n\nYeah the dollar may be inflationary but it's not going to inflate by 50% overnight. Bitcoin however, can easily deflate in value by 50% overnight regardless of the fact that it's deflationary by nature. \n\nThere's an altruistic way of looking at it - which is you. And then there's reality. \n\nBut this is all besides the point because daytrading this fuckin thing is FUN and EASY and PROFITABLE. Don't like profit? Are you a communist?",

I don\u2019t just buy one lump sum and sit on my ass waiting for it to go up.  I continue to buy and increase my stack.  The only difference is I take less risk by not selling.  Sure I may not make the quick buck like day traders but since I believe in bitcoin I strongly feel in the long run I\u2019ll be ok.   This is the same strategy many 401k advisers give to their participants.  It is extremely risky to time the market. That\u2019s ok for some people but not all. It all depends on your individual risk tolerance.   On the flip side, if you are really unsure about the future success of bitcoin then you have no business hodling in this market. You either day trade or get out.   ",

During this time, it was subject to periods of above-average inflation, followed by a period of hyperinflation.\n\nThe Zimbabwean dollar was introduced in 1980 to directly replace the Rhodesian dollar at par (1:1), at a similar value to the US dollar. Over time, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe reduced the Zimbabwe dollar to one of the lowest valued currency units in the world.\n\n***\n\n**Hyperinflation in early Soviet Russia**\n\nNote: This article uses the American naming system for large numbers (i.e. 1 billion = 1,000 million; 1 trillion = 1,000 billion; 1 quadrillion = 1,000 trillion; 1 quintillion = 1,000 quadrillion, etc.).\n\n\n\nHyperinflation in early Soviet Russia connotes a seven-year period of uncontrollable spiraling inflation in the early Soviet Union, running from the earliest days of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917 to the reestablishment of the gold standard with the introduction of the chervonets as part of the New Economic Policy. The inflationary crisis effectively ended in March 1924 with the introduction of the so-called \"gold ruble\" as the country's standard currency.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

If you have no idea on the timing, then you don't really know bitcoin is going to go down.

Leave some money aside to cover losses for short term fluctuations but if you know the whole trend then just don't put all you eggs in one basket so to speak and you should be theoretically fine.  The only hard part is knowing the price direction.  \n\n>So if for you, you need to know all of the details then you're right\n\nNo not at all.  I originally replied to a guy who came in here, never being right and not supplying any details, accusing people here of having delusion of grandeur.  I pointed out that people have been (wrongly) rolling out the same criticisms of bitcoin since 2012.\n\n>To me, you sound like you're saying: \"If you don't know what the temperature will be on June 15, you don't know that it'll be warmer!\".\n\nI like your temperature analogy.  Im saying that the temperature trend until june 15th will be warmer.  Some days it may be colder true.  But if I bet every day from now until june 15th that the following day would be warmer, I could make a ton of money overall.  More than enough to cover the few outlier days where we hit cold snaps.    \n\nAgain if you know the price of btc is going down, just bet that it goes down a little every day and make money despite fluctuations.  The reason I was replying to the kid originally was this though.  \n\n>none of us know anything about what Bitcoin will do. Nor do any traders, ever, in any asset, know anything about what's going to happen with their trades\n\nThat was my point to the kid, he doesn't know squat.  I would argue that while traders don't know with 100% certainly whats going to happen with their trades, good traders use the information available to them to bet on things that are more likely to happen, thats how the turn a profit and its what makes them \"good\" traders.

Which in my view amounts to nearly the same percent of USD domination in the international market. Meaning those big deals that basically control who gets what, how much and when. That being force on the world by strong political and military tactics gives USD its value. Everyone has agreed to accept the USD as a valuable form of exchange and there's little they can do about it. The US has control of spoken USD, basically monopolizing the world financial and economical sectors. I don't know. I'm following the whole thing with interest, because big big power is at stake, and not just for the United States. Other countries would like to take the spot of the US and are creeping up.",
