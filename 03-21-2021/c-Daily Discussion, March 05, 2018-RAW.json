            "Text": "Carter Thomas was spot on today. The people who moved the price from $6k to $11k were likely those who've been in the crypto space a while and not newbs. There just isn't a lot of excitement materializing into new sign-ups on Coinbase that we saw back in December. Even Youtube activity is slowing down among the crypto Youtubers.  \n\nThe solution? We've gotta get right back to talking about cryptos with our family, friends. I personally have no more holidays where I'll be meeting with family and relatives for at least 2 months, so I can see this being tricky to pull off for many in America alone.",

So these frequent hits, small dips and recoveries... well, I won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s back to normal until it pushes past 12.75k or so, or the volume picks back up to somewhat normal range.

At least we can say the market isn't super bearish now and either consolidating or slight showing some bullish momentum even though the Volume isn't great. I've seen these kind of consolidation in the past few years :) overall very happy even though I'm not holding any BTC but it affects the overall crypto market so good :) ",

It\u2019s looking pretty good now. Just as soon as it shows that it has truly bottomed out I will buy back in and not only will I instantly have more BTC than I had before. I\u2019m going to make money all the way back up. Holy shit!!! I\u2019m making money going both directions, increasing volume, and making the market a healthier place as hodling causes unhealthy growth if too many do it. \n\nI will accept your bitterness and tears as your apology.\ud83e\udd11\n\nEdit: \n\nLinked to said shit talking.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI just bought back in.

There was a moment of grand panic at 5.8k, such an enormous and quick drop.\n\nBut now, sentiment is better than it ever was, bitcoin is back at a constant growing rythm like it was before the enormous fomo. Almost every media is bullish on it, also. Every single news seems to be positive and volume is slowly picking up each week.\n\nIf you bought in at 15k+ on the rise wanting to be rich yesterday without effort or patience, sure, you might be salty. The way a market works means that most people bought before 11k and a lot of them cashed out on the rise and during the crash, making profit. Don't see why people that profited from the last bull run wouldnt be back in soon to profit again seeing how things are going. \n\nAlso, most hodlers are still fine and either bought months ago under 10k or bought again during the crash to up their holdings and are then fine average price wise.\n\nI think you are the only one in denial...!",

They sat in a wallet I had forgotten about until the 2013 spike, and I sold them @ 200USD. Didn't really have any faith the BTC would be a long-term survivor. \n\nFast forward to Nov 2017, and I'm kicking myself. Can't realistically get back into mining at this point in the game.. so I bought some BTC @18kUSD.\n\nFast forward to now, where I'm kicking myself again?\n",
