I think they are behaving like the fed with \u201cover the market\u201d operations to target overnight interest rates.  When it deviates too much from $1, they buy or sell USDT (that they generate out of thin air or take out circulation/destroy) with BTC until it gets more in line.  This will work until they run out of btc to sell to prop up the USDT value (like the Bank of England running out foreign reserves to defend the pound fixed rate in the early 90s). So if there are too many USDT sellers all at once, look out!",

Gdax has a huge sharp drop in volume starting somewhere around the new year that has remained consistently low. I do t see that in the other platforms, oddly. I would almost have expected that given how many had turned off registrations for a bit. But the volume on, say, bitstamp, has been much more variable. Down a bit from December, for sure, but nowhere near as much. Odd. ",
