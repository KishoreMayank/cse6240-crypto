The companies noted that both have previously filed individually to list bitcoin ETFs on various stock exchanges.\n\nVanEck chief executive Jan van Eck said bitcoin is \"a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios.\"\n\nThe CEO noted that the ETF has not yet been created, saying \"We're pleased to join with [SolidX] in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\" When asked by CoinDesk, he declined to provide details on what assets would be used to back the fund.\n\nNeither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date. As previously reported by CoinDesk, both companies withdrew previous attempts at launching the products at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nVan Eck expressed optimism about the fund's potential, despite the regulatory obstacles they have faced, saying:\n\n\"We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.\"\n\nIf approved by regulators, the new ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange, according to the release.",

No doubt some of that investment (which is pure speculation - or closer to gambling) is transferred from BTC.  \n\nThat pumping isn't necessarily the mythical whales - it is people trying to make a buck, who have no medium or long term interest in XCoin, or ArseCoin - or indeed Rogercoin aka Bcash - and why shouldn't they?\n\nThis is prob. why some shitcoins rise absurdly, while BTC rises a little.\n\nBut then everyone realises they are investing in shitcoins, the little bubble bursts, the market corrects, and BTC rises again as everyone comes back into the fold.\n\nBTC is suffering that, essentially, IMO.\n\nIn the long run it will be fine - but until people stop putting dollars or their BTC into 'TittyCoin' or 'BeerCoin' or 'WankCoin', this will continue.\n\nJust need to be patient.",

I'm sure that everyone is infected with malware exploits so everyone should just buy a hardware wallet. \n\nWhat are you, some sales expert?\n\nEveryone with some good sense is perfectly capable of storing a wallet file. It's no rocket science. You are just pushing others into buying that crap which security is unauditable, since there's no access to the source or the hardware schematics.\n\nAnd you even have the nerve to tell me *Go do some reading* ??

The only people supporting such devices are people like you who are incapable of maintaining a clean PC and push everyone around them into buying that crap, so they don't feel bad about themselves for buying some useless shit.\n\nStop spreading your bullshit and stop deceiving others into buying closed-source hardware wallets.\n\n\n",
