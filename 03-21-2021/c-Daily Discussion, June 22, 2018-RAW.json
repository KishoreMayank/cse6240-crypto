SEC declares Bitcoin Currency not a security.  Nasdaq launching, etfs coming.  Hash rate at its highest and rapidly growing.  Weak hands are flushed as was the intent of the market.   The reversal of the Mt Gox selling is the removal of a huge overhang.  So a few of the Japanese exchanges were ordered to clean up their act.  Hey it is legal currency in Japan, they should clean up their act.  Coinbase has its high roller index fund, responsible holding facilities are in place for institutions.  Yeah now is about the time.  And removing the Mt Gox overhang takes away the shorts cover.  Today is an inflection point.",

So if you think about it, and put $50 a week for 10 years that's $24,000 dollars saved or $48,000 in twenty years. So its a win win. But in order to profit off of bitcoin you need to have as many as you can afford, so if your watching the price you will lose in the end but if you set a goal to own bitcoin you will be well off. \"Never listen to someone who tries to predict the future, based on the past.\" -Tbone Lucchesse ",

It's the freakin day traders and the emotional buyers killing us right now. Anyone who thinks for more than 5 seconds knows it's completely foolish to sell right now or below these levels.. which is why I don't think it's going to fall off a cliff like in February. Volume exploded last week when it hit 6,200, imagine if it hits 5,900 - 6000 this time around. Smart people are lining up to buy or just waiting to jump back in. If I had more I was willing to throw in at this time, I'd be buying a full bitcoin for sure at 6,000.\n\nFUD along with the traders/emotional buyers are going to keep us low and range bound until the sentiment changes or something brings a spark to this market.",

Some people think what the USA says or does, does not affect global sentiment and price. BS, you're looking at that effect. Bottom line: Other countries certainly do mimic USA monetary policy. Don't believe it? Read world news. Okay, throw several mil peeps that are tired of the slimebag scammers coming out of the wood works in there too, as being a large part of the reason for the decline. The thieving assholes of the world are in dire need of some instant charma. If it doesn't happen, global regs will see that it does; in some form or another. I feel for the millions of people that got burned on dreams over nothing more than hype. I feel a lot less for those that got burned; parading around in their e-clown costumes, with rockets strapped to their backs - moon or bust  printed on them during the charade. Oh well, clowns will be clowns...hard lessons learned. And for God sakes people, don't sell it if you believe crypto will make a comeback in lets say.... 10, maybe 30 years. GLTA, except to those assholes that also fucked up a good thing while forgetting charma pounces when one least expects it!\n\nedit: for the trolls out there...no, I didn't get burned. I picked up some BTC last August, threw it in a cold wallet and it's been forgotten ever since. I did not buy what I was not prepared to loose. Common sense, if you will -  about a 10-12 year old digital currency technology intended to supplant existing monetary systems that took hundreds, if not thousands of years to evolve.",

You only put in enough that if crypto goes to zero you go \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \"Oh well, I tried, I was wrong. No biggy.\"\n\nIt doesn't really matter what you \"tie\" it to. For instance, you can tie it to gold or anything *right now* by converting from fiat money. Fiat money is used because that's the easiest method of trading. Much more difficult to buy bitcoin digitally with physical gold (or even securities that represent gold).\n\nThe problem with number 3 is just because a government or anyone creates new crypto it doesn't mean it's going to affect the market in any large way. People have to be willing to adopt it, willing to trust it. It's hard to develop trust in new crypto long term. \n\nThe reason Bitcoin is probably the least risky bet is because it has the most history, the most trust. That could change eventually, but it's where we are now.",

            "Text": "A responsible government WOULD buy bitcoin as a hedge against its on deflationary fiat.  If you think about it, the US government has about 11 trillion in current gold value all in.  running a 21 trillion debt and ever growing.  Having some bitcoin that hits the big numbers wouldn't be such a bad hedge. Especially if they bought them now.  But knowing the US government they would buy at the all time high, kinda like they did with oil filling the SPR.   Not really financially strategic but hey they do have a printing press.   \n\nBitcoin doesn't need to be tied as it is it's own commodity. Per most governments.  The point is to unshackle from the oppression of central banks and corrupt governments.\n\nMy opinion is I would rather hodl, not spend, although spending is fine and the network and hash rate are growing exponentially.  I'll take the ride as a store of value and spend depreciating fiat.",

The normies are gone, even the 'buy-the-dip' folks have virtually disappeared,  and now we place our faith in the 'institutional buy ins', which may never materialize as long as volume and interest is this anemic. Even if/when it starts to rise, people are still going to be selling constantly to just exit the market to break even and to take profits all the way up. This market will take many, many years to reach a new all time high. I'm going to HODL some of my investment for Moon^(tm)  and actual usage, but I am definitely selling most on the way up; I don't like the risk anymore. My money can be invested much better elsewhere.",

You don't care about the dollar against the Euro because you get paid in dollars, and you purchase goods priced in dollars with dollars. \n\nPeople care about Bitcoin vs USD because they still have to purchase things with dollars (or at least PRICED in dollars). Do if BTC loses half it's value you still have the same number of bitcoins, but now you can only buy half as much gas or milk with it. It's all about purchasing power, which is what you should actually care about.  ",

            "Text": "Your message could have been shared at many points in Bitcoin's history. It's possible that this is it, and everyone is disillusioned... but I think that's unlikely. \n\nBitcoin is continuing to gain respectability - it was recently mentioned in the US Supreme Court. Some people who were previously adamantly against it are now more tempered, at least in what they publicly say (e.g., Jamie Dimon). There are people who still seem to associate Bitcoin with high fees, despite that being a quite short period, with actual improvements in the transaction situation since that time (exchanges batching, increasing adoption of segwit, and development of the lightning network). This also reflects continued advancements in the technology, with many people continuing to contribute their time to make it better.\n\nAny bad news today (aside from the price) seems to be easily interpretable as good news - Mt. Gox's creditors will be able to receive Bitcoin rather than cash, helping reduce the massive amount of coins in Mt. Gox's control, and redistributing them back to the people who should own them. There are stricter regulations for exchanges being imposed in Japan, which could either be seen as bad by those who advocate for complete freedom to transfer and exchange wealth, or good news for people who favour some sort of official oversight or legitimacy.\n\nAs near as I can tell, the only really bad news lately is the price. This has happened before. It will probably happen again. There doesn't seem to be any reason (to me) to suspect that this time really is different, and Bitcoin is on a permanent decline.",

These people are despairing pretty much as they are watching what they believe is \"losing all they have\". Bad news on top of bad news causes whales to sell and the despairing hands follow. The loss of $6k support means extremely increased despair as we have not gone under that for ages. A test of $5k is probable (that's the previous bottom before $6k was set). Eventually as it gains awareness it will recover everything but that might not happen until the end of the year.",

(bitFlyer Japan) was one of several virtual currency exchanges to receive an improvement order from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA), the regulator of virtual currency exchanges in Japan, in accordance with Article 63-16 of the Payment Services Act. This order is directed to bitFlyer Japan and not to its USA or European entities, which are regulated in their own geographical jurisdictions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe order received by bitFlyer Japan relates to the compulsory ID verification procedures of our operations in Japan. As a result, we will be re-examining the ID verification for certain existing customers. To ensure this process is completed quickly and effectively, we will be voluntarily and temporarily suspending the onboarding of new customers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nbitFlyer Japan wholeheartedly apologizes to our customers for not having met the JFSA\u2019s exacting standards at this time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nbitFlyer Japan\u2019s team is united in our sincerity regarding this business improvement order. The safety and security of our customers and their assets on our platform has always been and will remain our primary concern.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs a company, we strongly believe that regulation is fundamental to the long-term future of Bitcoin and the virtual currency industry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused to our customers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBusiness Improvement Orders\n\n(1)\tIn order to operate a suitable and reliable business, take the measures listed below\n\n\u2460\tPerform an intense review of the management system\n\n\u2461\tBuild out risk management system for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism\n\n\u2462\tBuild out management system for rejecting antisocial forces, etc.\n\n\u2463\tBuild out management system for user assets and take a managerial approach to books and documents\n\n\u2464\tBuild out management system for user protection measures\n\n\u2465\tBuild out management system for system risks\n\n\u2466\tBuild out management system for user information safety\n\n\u2467\tBuild out management system for ensuring the appropriate interactions for complaints from or consultations with customers\n\n\u2468\tBuild out risk management system for the listing of new virtual currencies\n\n\u2469\tRegarding improvements \u2460 through \u2468, a third party shall verify the improvements\u2019 appropriateness and effectiveness\n\n(2)\tA business improvement plan for the improvements ordered in (1) must be submitted in writing by July 23, 2018\n\n(3)\tUntil the time that the business improvement plan has been fully enacted, a monthly report must be submitted by the tenth of each month detailing the previous month's progress and implementation status",

For it to head back that direction literally means people have given up on it. The problem with hash power is when the price starts to get down around $4,000 a lot of miners are going to shut down. If they get sold which many of them will what you're going to have is a situation where network hashpower is down and the Pirates now own a lot of what was Network  power. Welcome to the age of 51% attacks. This Will Destroy sentiment even further. There is so much more hashpower out there today than there was years ago. ",

Then all of a sudden today you decided to come here and shit on bitcoin. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I respect it. But for my own understanding, I would like to know why this comment, why today? My first instinct is that you are part of some sort of organized campaign to spread FUD, but I have a hard time believing it to be true. I'd like for you to respond to me, not to tell me the reasons you don't believe bitcoin will succeed, but rather to tell me what made you make this post today. If you don't respond, or you respond by telling me why bitcoin sucks, I will have my answer all the same. Thanks.",

There was just a ridiculous amount of hash power sold in 2017. Did you see that chart of how much it would cost to attack so many coins on the market? Now imagine taking some of that network hash power offline. Now imagine being able to purchase hash power cheaper\n\nThat's a perfect scenario for attacks\n\nIf you could make all of that hash power disappear then sure. You could go back in time. Let me know when you find the DeLorean\n\nThe absolute best-case scenario is more mining will start to take place in the parts of the world with the lowest power costs. If that were to happen we can probably withstand 2500 to 3000? Somewhere in there but even that is a gamble because you don't really know how much hashpower is going to continue to increase. Just looking at the difficulty chart it's still going up even as the price goes down. If you start talking about lower prices than that then you're talking about a drop in difficulty and hash power coming off line. Which rewinds to my previous statement.

You can create them, but the question is, will people come? By definition, no other crypto will have as long of history as the original Bitcoin. That unbroken chain garners a lot of trust, and trust is what gives Bitcoin it's intrinsic value.\n\n>Just because you can't eat or touch Bitcoin doesn't mean it's intrinsic value is zero. It's value is tied to people's opinions of it, and the amount of attention people pay to it. As this increases, the value increases, and Bitcoin is the most likely candidate to draw an outsized portion of attention over the long term.",

Yes, I am certain that the vast majority of crypto investors do not believe in the technology and are only in it for the short term gains. Yes, I do believe there is fear, uncertainty, and doubt around bitcoin. The issue is I believe all three of those things are completely valid descriptors of the crypto market.\n\nI think bitcoin/crypto currencies (as they are currently sold) are some of the silliest ideas I have heard of, that\u2019s why I criticize it.

            "Text": "Ok, if the value is based on people's opinions, what are those opinions and what are they based on? Positive opinions of Bitcoin/crypto seem to fall into a few categories:\n\n1. Those who see it as a speculative investment and whose ultimate goal is to eventually cash out for fiat currency or other value stores. The cleverest and luckiest among these people make money off the vast majority of others who pump cash into crypto hoping to do the same. These people are not contributing to the long-term viability of crypto beyond its use for scamming and predatory investing. Works for Amway I guess, although they at least nominally engage in real economic activity in the form of sale of physical products.\n1. Those who believe it will become a viable currency in the future. You and I both apparently agree this isn't likely to happen, and even if it did, it'd lead to deflationary economic chaos which would be unsustainable.\n1. People who \"believe in the technology\". These fall into 2 camps: people who don't  understand how blockchains actually work and latch onto its mysticism. These are the same people who believe in homeopathy, astrology, qi energy, crystal powers, and other pseudoscientific charlatanism. The second camp is people who do understand how blockchains work and are convinced there is a viable economic application beyond cryptocurrency as it exists today. Thus far, it doesn't seem anyone has found such an application. If they do, it probably won't do anything to drive the value of Bitcoin since it will be a completely different blockchain serving a fundamentally different purpose. Bitcoin will hold as much comparative value to this new technology as stagecoaches do to automobiles.\n\nPeople's opinions are not what give Bitcoin value anyway. Its value lies in people's willingness and ability to exchange other things of value for it. Opinions are certainly a *proxy* for willingness, but they are not value in and of themselves. The pool of people who are both willing and able to exchange value for crypto already hit its all-time high point and is going to continue to spiral down for a long time to a zero or near-zero baseline since there are no long-term factors that will reverse this trend.",

            "Text": "Do you mine? Because I do. I'm really familiar with this. \n\nThe reason Bitcoin can never work at those lower prices again is the hashrate. If it's unprofitable for miners they are going to shut off. As that happens the hash rate will go down and the adjustment will take place. However the network just became weaker. This is the problem. When you look at all the hash power that was sold in 2017 alone. Shit if you took all of that and lumped it together you could even attack Bitcoin. That by the way is going to be the last one to go. The real concern is with all the altcoins. If they start getting blown up it's really going to hurt sentiment. The kind of hash power on the market right now is just nowhere near the same as 2016. That's why we can't go back to 2016 prices. Network hash power would fall and difficulty would correct which would make it far more vulnerable. Reread this until you get it if you still aren't getting it.\n\nFrom the time Bitcoin began in 2009 we have never had a situation where the lowest cost power was unable to be profitable.. bitmain just negotiated a contract in Washington, if it's like a lot of the others it's going to be about four and a half cents a kilowatt hour maybe 5. You can do the math on that to figure out where their bottom line is. ",

They are not the same, so why compare an apple to a car? \n\nThe thing with the stock market is, since the crash in 2008 and the flash crash a few years later, markets are not allowed to crash anymore like in the past, as soon as too many sellers come in on the stock market and the price drops too much the markets gets halted 5 minutes, then an hour and if it still doesn't work a day. To only allow bid orders so the price stays up. \n\nThis is why the markets can't crash anymore, and only small corrections can occur and that's why I think we will have a bull market with sideways times that could take a year and corrections of around max 10% in the next 10 years. \n\nAnd what I say is already working, we are currently already in the longest bull market ever while bonds drop in price with rising interest rates and still the market isn't crashing. \n",
