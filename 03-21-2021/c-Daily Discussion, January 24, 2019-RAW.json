You'd only sell at a loss if you were scared it'd go worthless (causing you to lose more money or all your money). The lower the price is at, the less people would profit with selling their BTC. Thus the chance of the bear trend stopping is greater. The inverse is also true, the more the price climbs abnormally, the higher the chance for it to stop climbing, because more and more people will want to sell their BTC in order to consolidate profit, even those who bought high.",

It has affected cryptocurrency negatively, and I believe it's one of the main causes of the unexpected drop from $6k (a very cemented support nearly no one believed would get breached). People are basically scared now because after the price action we had, they don't feel quite in the mood to buy BTC. Which means that it can take a good while before BTC recovers.",

Because potential buyers/sellers are finite. The more is bought the less people will want to buy (price is high), the more is sold the less people will want to sell (price is low). Only FOMO and the belief an asset will fully crash are exceptions to that.",

Again, what I am saying is: The more supports the bears break the more likely it is for a turnover. This is not emotional reasoning. The lower the price is at the fewer people will want to sell it. Ok, there might be those who gave up on BTC and just think it will continue falling endlessly, and will sell at a loss. But the more this continues the less people will have that kind of reasoning or will profit from selling. The inverse is also true. I am not being emotional. I am not analyzing history, I am not analyzing facts, I am just using logic. It may still fall further - yes. But it's more likely for it to stop now than when we were at $6k.",
