            "Text": "Bitcoin needs useful constructive criticism to challenge its development. This has been beneficial to all emerging technologies, particularly during the first few decades of growth. \n\nSo why can't we get some quality criticism in this sub? Why are we stuck with a handful of kiddies with multiple accounts spamming their ignorant schoolyard digs? Our sub has become riddled with highschool drop out trolls with the intellect of larva, spamming that bitcoin is worth zero. They have no knowledge of economics, and even less of technology. Soon they will be talking to themselves via their own multiple accounts, but bitcoin will continue to thrive as it has for a decade.",

I know other crypto's might do so faster or even cheaper than BTC but there's no denying that for now BTC is by far the most internationally liquid and reliable option out there. \n\nNow whether that's worth 3.5k, 2k or 20k per BTC I don't know, but if you're using it rather than speculating on its value it doesn't really matter anyways. \n\nAnyways I think we should all support actual usage of crypto's, even if you're just speculating on it, go out and see what you can do today with your crypto. Speculation alone will not bring us into the next bullrun with current sentiment, I think a trigger in the form of demand from adoption is needed. \n",

With the total combined value of the two new BCH alt coins now worth LESS than 200usd, it is an appropriate time to offer our help with any negative feelings that you might be having. For example if someone started out with say 5 bitcoins valued at todays prices of about 17,000usd in total minus the 980usd your Altcoin is now worth(in total) a net loss of $16,020. Although 16,020USD lost is small potatoes to some of us, for others this could smart a little. For your own mental health please feel free to tell us your own personal experiences. We particularly wish to help those who have lost much much more than that. Tell the community how you made that call and if you perhaps blame any body for this? I am sure the community will rally around and give you much needed support. Let it all out, I guarantee you will feel much better...\nWe really feel your pain. Anybody who feels depressed about making that call (obviously it seemed sensible at the time to you) please share this with the community.",

Improvements such as LN address this, and will continue to as we move forward. There was no future for streaming video when the first 30 years of internet had no bandwidth to accomodate. Email was text based at first, highly complicated for any average person and initially higly criticized as a potential means of mainstream communication. No sane supporter if bitcoin feels it could be mass adopted as it stands right now. We're betting on the future when we invest in high risk potential tech. If it was already evolved to mainstream status, there would be no investment opportunity.",

Anyone that felt as convinced as you claim to be that bitcoin is worthless would not spend this much time and effort on bitcoin. You're fooling nobody. I've tried talking with you on several occasions about the pros and cons, the flaws and benefits, etc. You just go around in circles because you have no interest in exploring bitcoin in depth. You have an agenda and it's obvious. What brought you to this low in your life that you need to troll to earn money is your issue, but nobody here has to have any inhibitions about down-voting bullshit, so please get over yourself.",

If you were sure and were warning others, and were right all this time, why was this your strategy?

So clearly there is an agenda. \n\nI am interested in Bitcoin, and I am aware of the path this is all on, and it's not going away. The price thing? Well, this is a bear market, and who knows when it switches gears and reverts to bull. But are you trying to tell me that you are spending time in this sub for an asset and technology that you have nothing positive to say about, just because you enjoy writing pessimistic comments to a bitcoin community?\n\nI barely have time to involve myself in the things I support and I can't imagine investing time on something I don't support, just to criticize it, unless I was being rewarded in some way. I mean would I go to church where a community of believers gathered, if I was not a believer myself? Just to tell them I believe they are wrong?? Would I expect a warm welcome? No! So, in short, this is why most people will assume your repeated visits to this sub are a result of paid trolling.",

What doesn't make sense is how you could be so sure ever since February 2018 that it was going down (all the way to $1k-$2k according to you in this thread), and just decided to keep holding on to it. \n\nI also find it funny you're claiming you've been so sure and right all this time, but from the same comment I was linking to before from you a few months ago:\n\n>there have been little up-ticks, but mainly it just goes down. when will this end? its just seems to be endlessly less and less. I keep hearing it will never go below $10K, then $9K, then it will never go below $6.5K, now i hear it will never go below $6K (some are even saying that $5K is the botton, and it will never go below that) - but honestly I don't know. I just want it to 1.) stop going down 2.) start going up.\n\nPeople sometimes misremember the past, and think that they've known what was happening all along. However, this isn't really true. You're either wrong now about how certain you were before, or you were lying then about how doubtful you were (but then, why did you hold all the way to the current lows?). This isn't a specific problem with you, this is something most people do called the \"hindsight bias\". It does mean you should be skeptical about your own (and others!) claims to have been accurately and confidently predicting things.",

One more generation with bitcoin, and your tiny simplified reason of how bitcoin can not be accepted and utilized as an alternative and functional currency will be decimated. Simple.",
