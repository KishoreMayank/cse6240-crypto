While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market.\n\nIndeed, it's true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower.\n\nHowever, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month.\n\nNotably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nView\n\nBTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000.\n\nOn the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).\n\nOnly a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival.",

It broke out at $9,260, peaked at $9.9k should have pulled back to $9.2k and then go to $12k.\n\nNone of that has happened so far.  So everybody and their dog knows we've broken through.  $12k is a week away if it is even that slow.\n\nIt's just my opinion, not trading advice.  I've loaded up to my eyebrows. I bought everything I could afford on that down move 2 days ago.\n\nI think we're going to see big bars soon. We're not going to $10k tonight, we're going well past.  Just my opinion.",

Daily, weekly, even monthly salary value price swings in a day, wow. Mass adoption... really? Or are we only talking about the west? ",

Depending on time zone actually.\n\nI'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise  people who do make quite accurate calls ? Seems to be fashionable over here. Bit of group hysteria. Maybe that's why I don't see other competent traders here. They just go away.\n\nIn all fairness it is a Bitcoin reddit, not a trading reddit, but the two go hand\\-in\\-hand. You can't do one without the other. I'd think the group would like to encourage people with technical skills, not chase them away, ",
