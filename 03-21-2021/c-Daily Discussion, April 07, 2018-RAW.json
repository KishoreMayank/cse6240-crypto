I blocked him yesterday for spouting the same unsubstantiated negativity over and over and over and over.....While he thinks what he is posting is very clever and insightful, all that he is doing is spreading FUD and using \"brilliant\" hindsight to try and prove his point. I have never seen anyone with so little of a life before. If bitcoin dies, I will move on with my life, go do something else. This poor basement dweller spends hours on this sub, trolling and spreading FUD for all he is worth. All he is managing to do is showing that he is actually a poor sodd that lost his shirt with bitcoin and he is so scared that anyone else can be successful. So scared bitcoin will go to the moon, he cannot go on with life. All he has ever done was ask for proof or ask \"what do you really mean by saying this or that\". Not one valid point ever, not 1 shred of proof for what he is sprouting except: bitcoin did this and bitcoin done that\", ignoring the fact that bitcoin also did GREAT in the past. I advice everyone to block him. The peace from silencing him is worth at least 20 bitcoin. Don't bother trying to reply to me MrJokeOfTheSub, I will not see it anyway. NOTE: r/bitcoin: a community dedicated to bitcoin. If you do not believe in bitcoin, then go away, we do, and no amount of trolling or FUD from you will change that. Side Note: I am truly sorry for your financial loss, but how about giving others a chance?\n\nEdit: spelling",

It seems like a large group of this subreddit expects that the price should and will be rising by thousands per month. I'm convinced that most people here know very little about how any of this works and likely bought in months ago while the price was higher.\n\nHow many times has it been now during this drawn out downward spiral where, we see a brief upswing, and everyone comes out of hiding saying \"we've hit bottom! 6900 has major support!!!11!. If it breaks through though, it will hit even large support at 6400. If it breaks through 7k then it will continue up until 11k.\" ? People are really pulling this all out of their ass.",

One thing I realized is that US customers is all that matters with regard to price. Refunds are coming now and if the community cares about the future they will keep it simple and easy rather than needing a computer science degree to operate. We see lightning is coming on but without uers, whats the point to scale? These hardforks need to stop now. Mistakes were made and passions ran high but lets move on and ignore the 8/1 fork and move on with 2nd layer. We need better interfaces. Coinbase hurt the market more than anythingby allowing bitcoin cash on its services. If they keep allowing hard forks, no one will invest. There is one bitcoin. adding blocks is just centralizing miners to have more power. Coinbase would be wise to get ride of bitcoin cash and any future hard forks. Enough ideology of the free market will decide. The free market are uneducated and we are just confusing new users. Enough. Apologize, remove it, focus on adoption and ease of use and lets go. This year will be the last time the current generation gives bitcoin a second look. 2 weeks all.... enough of editors allowing FUD. Lets get this right in the next month and take back the years lost that bitcoin cash and coinbase cost us. Get to work. ",

It's already been 4 months since the move down started, momentum is fading for shorts, in fact we couldn't get to $6000 again. So if history repeats itself we should start heading up now and take out $20k before the end of the year. Because that's what happened last time.\n\nSo no it's not coming out of the ass, it's just looking at what's happened before and thus is the most likely to happen again. ",

            "Text": "Tech investor Tim Draper, whose recent re-entry to India\u2019s market was prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s promise to crackdown on corruption, nevertheless criticized India\u2019s negative stance on cryptocurrencies during an interview with The Economic Times published yesterday, April 6.\n\nDraper had returned to the Indian market in February 2017 - having exited it in 2016 due to a perceived lack of \u201crule of law\u201d prompting Draper Fisher Jurvetson to sell their entire Indian portfolio - when the Mumbai-based startup backer Blume Ventures joined the Draper Venture Network.\n\nIndia\u2019s central bank had announced on April 5 that they would no longer deal with crypto-related accounts - not the direct government ban on crypto which had been falsely rumoured in early February. India\u2019s Ministry of Finance had also criticized cryptocurrency as a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d without \u201cintrinsic value\u201d at the beginning of January.\n\nDespite his positive outlook on Modi\u2019s ability to stamp out corruption, Draper calls the Indian government\u2019s denial of cryptocurrency as valid tender as \u201cthe stupidest thing,\u201d also referencing China\u2019s similar stance:\n\n\u201cIf I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake.\u201d\n\nDraper notes that \u201cBitcoin and [B]lockchain are the best things to have happened for business,\u201d adding that \u201ccountries such as India, where billions of rupees are wasted on inefficiencies and needless paperwork, will benefit most from the ease and security of blockchain.\u201d If India makes cryptocurrency illegal, then, according to Draper, \u201cother countries will raise their hands to get all the [Indian Blockchain] entrepreneurs:\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the local authorities are banning crypto, then companies in the space should move elsewhere. The government needs to realize that it is stifling innovation and should instead be creating an environment where these ideas can be tested and promoted. They have the choice to be trendsetters and attract the world\u2019s best engineers and coders, or lose their best and brightest to other regions.\u201d\n\nDraper, who is a Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast, said during the interview that Bitcoin \u201cshould be the national currency\u201d of India, for Draper believes that its \u201cglobal\u201d nature and ability to store value will make it \u201cacceptable everywhere for transactions\u201d in a few years.\n\nDraper also spoke about the potential for Blockchain to \u201croc[k] the venture capital business,\u201d creating a competitive virtual environment where only the \u201cflexible and reinvent[ive]\u201d will be successful:\n\n\u201cDown the road, you won\u2019t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.\u201d\n\nIn regards to investments in future Indian Blockchain and crypto startups, Draper mentioned that Blume Ventures and Boost VC had co-invested in Unocoin, and that he will \u201ccontinue to seek other opportunities.\u201d\n\nOne of Unocoin\u2019s co-founders, Sathvik Vishwanath, had said earlier this week that the central bank has not taken the \u201cright direction\u201d in regards to cryptocurrencies, citing that the bank\u2019s ban will \u201ccause panic among a few million people in India who are already using [cryptocurrencies.]\u201d",

            "Text": ">But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.\n\nI find it very unlikely that taxation is what creates \"inherent value\" for fiat currencies. Taxation means there's some need for that particular currency, but no evidence is shared that argues that that need is what drives the value. \n\nFor example, consider the United Arab Emirates. There is no income tax and, until recently, no VAT either. Government spending was done through the money raised for oil. Yet they still had a functioning fiat currency. According to your argument here, this should be impossible.\n\nThe reason this is possible is because currency gets its value from what others are willing to give up to get it. Taxation may create some small amount of demand, but it is not the only source of demand, and is not a necessary component of demand.\n\n>Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency \u2013 its limited supply \u2013 ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.\n\nYour scenario here doesn't really seem to make sense - as you said, bitcoin would increase in value as the quantity (and quality) of goods and services for sale grows. If this leads to a high level of deflation that discourages investment broadly speaking, then the quantity and quality of goods and services for sale would no longer \nbe growing. The deflation rate should be tied to the productive capacity of the global economy, which means that is should reach some sort of balance - if it's growing really quickly, investment is discouraged, if it's shrinking, investment is encouraged.",

            "Text": "You seem to think I'm saying that Bitcoin is a bubble and that Bitcoin believers are delusional, and that Bitcoin will collapse, or something. Actually I did publicly predict that Bitcoin would fall below $10k back at $12k, as did in fact many experts and others, so the idea that nothing is predictable except in hindsight is not exactly true. But I wasn't trying to make a bearish statement with this post, actually the opposite.\n\nWhat I can tell you from my personal experience with hodl is that it is a form of self-deception, a willing blindness to logic and reason. What I can also tell you is that it made me a lot of money and I am going to keep doing it. If logic and reason will lead you astray, you must blind yourself to them. You must exercise doublethink. Just as the party makes its own truth in 1984, hodlers will make their own truth by hodling. \n\n",

            "Text": "> trading the market and not giving a shit about the Asset itself\n\nThere's hardly any big money player that gives a flying fuck about Bitcoin. They are in it to make money. \n\nMost ppl in general are trading Bitcoin to make actual money. Because that's all it is for now. A get rich quick scheme.\n\nYou think they give a shit about hodling ? Using it as currency lol? About decentralized? None of those things matter. It's a basic pump and dump\n\nGet in low, ride it to +50% or whatever profit range you had in mind and leave a winner.\n\nThat's what happened on that bullshit manipulated ride up to 19k. Big money pushed it up and sold the fuck out. It would have a sustained move up if they actually believed in \"hodling\"\n\nOnly fools are hodling. The minute you are in a decent profit range, cash the fuck out. \n\nDon't care about no damn future use as a currency, as a decentralized tool, etc etc. Ppl just wanna make money. Could care less about the morals of this asset lol. ",

A global hyper-inflationary depression. \n\nThere is a ton of ways ja, and none of them are coming close to what the crypto's are doing.

It doesn't take just new money to send it up, it takes the current holders to decide the value is too low I don't sell at this level. \n\nThe more it goes up the less likely current holders are to sell. Everyone watching Bitcoin knows its low. There's a few short sellers but they are getting less and less convinced as you can see by the slow down in downwards momentum. And in fact Friday there was a big short cover as you can see by the jump. \n\nSo now as we start hitting the levels going up more and more people are going to cover driving the price up and less and less will be selling, they'll be holding out for higher prices. \n\nAnd we have the next leg up. And historically it will be maybe 1000%, maybe 2000% up. I think you'll find sellers thin on the ground once it's confirmed we've turned. I think that will be at $12 000",

How many of the very few merchants that supposedly take bitcoin actually rely in intermediaries to promptly exchange it to fiat?\n\nIt's about choices, for us in the west, I'ts not really a problem using third party services to process our transactions - we can afford it. The true power is YOU are your own bank and processor (or atleast the network that you are part of is). Where the likes of PayPal may take high fees, or cause problems with chargebacks, YOU have more control.\n\n>How's Silk Road and its founder doing these days? Some success.\n\nSilkroad died because the owner was stupid enough to link his dark web identity to his real world identity - but that irreverent. Again, the desire to process you own payments is very powerful and it means governments CANT stop you - even if it was made illegal.\n\n>If you don't mind your supposedly stored value swinging up and down in such a wild manner that you can't financially plan for even a few days ahead.\n\nStore of value is not the same as being immune to inflation/deflation.

I see no reason to believe that it is necessarily to be extended to any and all currencies.\n\nWell, that's the claim that was being made. If the argument is just that \"US dollars derive their value from being taxed, while this is not true for other currencies\", then it's not really relevant for Bitcoin, is it?\n\nThe claim was:\n>But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars.\n\nI provided an example where this wasn't true - a fiat currency that did not get inherent value from being needed for tax.\n\nIf the argument is that fiat currencies gain their value because there is a demand that exists for them... this is true for Bitcoin too. The argument that fiat has some sort of inherent value that bitcoin doesn't is wrong. There may be some base level of demand for fiat currencies for taxes, but this isn't where most of their value comes from.\n\n>Here is a question: what is the (mostly) standard currency for trading in oil? What currency have the sheiks been taking for their oil for all these years? Why? What do you think would happen to the UAW currency if USD tanked?\n\nThis has nothing to do with whether Bitcoin has inherent value or not. For a while, the US dollar has been acting as the world's reserve currency. \n\nI don't know what would happen to the UAW currency if the USD tanked. I think it would depend on the reason for it tanking. If a weak USD indicated a general slowdown in the US economy, decreasing global demand for oil, it would go down, presumably. If the weak USD was due to some other reason, then it's possible it wouldn't affect it so much.\n\n> \"limited volume of money\" is ultimately a disaster; and we know that from past \"experiments\"\n\nI'm not aware of disastrous experiments that clearly show problems due to the fixed supply of currency, rather than other problems that have traditionally accompanied it (challenges with the divisibility of currency, or sticky wages, for example).\n\nI agree that in a Bitcoin-only world, monetary policy is no longer a tool that governments could use. I don't think we'd ever end up in a Bitcoin-only world. If we did, governments would have to rely on fiscal policy to the extent that they want to impact the economies of their citizens.",

If you are used to focus on details and analyzing structures this benefits you in many lines of work. The problem with the strongest autists, if I may speculate, is that they may not be able to have the self-control in order to distinguish between that which is useful and purposeful and that which is not.

            "Text": "It's off cause I don't think this forum condones gambling and I don't think the price will drop that low within the next few hours; I already said that the price will probably go up like two times because the price fluctuates so quickly and my hunch think it's due for another increase in price anyways.\n\nI am only convinced that the price will be lower than the price right at this moment 7 days later. Not going to bet on it anymore but if I had to hypothetically, I would bet at most $50.",

            "Text": "I said before that the price fluctuates too quickly to make it a convincing bet, which is why I am more confident in waiting 7 days to see the result. It may be 7100 now and it may even reach 7500 very soon but I think that this is only temporary and the price will continue to decline in the coming days since it's been like this for months. I don't want to bet on something that takes only luck to find out.",
