            "Text": "Bitcoin Cash was trading at $4300 at one point around a year ago. Today, it\u2019s barely $130. I get it cryptocurrency is flooded with manipulation including Bitcoin. But, how is a 97% drop even possible? BCH was $75 at one point taking the loss further into 98.6%. This leads me to believe even 100% is possible. That\u2019s how altcoins get destroyed. But, a top 10 altcoins really? I fear that Bitcoin could fall a lot further because the whales maintain the same stakehold in BTC (around 40-50%). BCash just about Enron\u2019ed itself. Despite the 2000+ currencies, I think BTC is the only credible one because you don\u2019t hear Satoshi selling the same way Vitalik sells Ethereum left and right.",

            "Text": "It does not matter, tech or banks or retail or blockchain. End of the day its supply-demand. Bitcoins demand was created by hype and the smart ones sold at the right time. Warren Buffet knew there was nothing which could keep the demand strong as there are no real time adopted mass scale usage of it. Just some punks who thought they are the new cool. Hence once the hype died, people found it as a lossy investment and the volume went down and with it the price. As of now I do not need Bitcoin for anything at all, apart from buying it and retaining it as a novelty.  Other tech stocks have value generation by actual usage as a platform for trade or a service or a platform and hence they generate value in form of stocks. Basically, we have been fooled. Unless Bitcoin is adopted in a massive scale by some international event and someone finds value to trade it, it will go down and down for years and possibly be at zero.",

This is more secure than a single sig wallet while being easier than a hardcore cold storage setup. \n\nBe sure to write down the seed words that are shown during the wallet creation process and put that piece of paper somewhere safe.

You know if you look at what he did in the past and you think man he got a really stiff sentence. No one should have went to prison for that. Well I agree but you have to wonder if the DA realized what a flaming piece of shit he actually was and that's why he got such a stiff sentence.

All addresses and balances are now on your new phone. For extra safety, create a new wallet (with new seed) and move everything to that one.\n\nIts far more important to safely secure your seed than your phone.",

Additionally you can have a pin or password.\n\nIf you have the words, you can download a compatible wallet software and recover the wallet with your money. \n\nSo... Keep those words safe!\n\nAlso, 1 BTC is enough to justify a hardware wallet, in my opinion.",
