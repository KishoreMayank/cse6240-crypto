There are many models you can adopt. The best suggestion I can make is to play around with a small amount of funds while finding a model that works for you. But if you have enough bitcoin to worry about, then get a hw wallet.",

Of course there is manipulation in such a young market, but you neglect to acknowledge the driving forces that brought bitcoin from pennies to thousands of dollars in just 10 short years. I'm not claiming that bitcoin is going to be worth a million dollars anytime soon, but it is realistic to recognize that the same forces are still in play, and that crypto is a growing entity globally... not the market price of bitcoin, but the entity itself. It could easily be years before we see another hype pricing phase, but gradual growth relative to development and infrastructure is far more realistic than your whale conspiracy theory.",
