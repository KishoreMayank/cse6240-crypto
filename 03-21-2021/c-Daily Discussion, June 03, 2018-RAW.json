            "Text": "I am optimistic about the long term prospects of Bitcoin. It sounds like you've looked at its history - I'm not sure if there has ever been a more volatile asset than Bitcoin, so keep in mind that over the short-to-medium term, the worth of your Bitcoin may go far up or far down. I think in the long-term it will go up much higher, but it could still go to almost nothing. \n\nIf you buy Bitcoin, make sure that you are extremely careful - move it to a private wallet (look up cold storage for anything you're not hoping to spend).\n\nKeep track of how much you buy and what the cost is. \n\nRegarding timing the market, this is notoriously difficult - Bitcoin's history is littered with people who made some money day-trading, only to lose on unexpected swings. People here will often find a short-lived pattern that soon vanishes, and many people will confidently predict what will happen in the short term, despite how often they are wrong. \n\nIf you're interested in investing in general, buying index funds that track whole markets is an excellent choice. These tend to have low expense ratios (much lower than traditional mutual funds), and over the long term have consistently done well. View Bitcoin as something with a great deal of potential and risk - try balancing this out with some other investments.",
