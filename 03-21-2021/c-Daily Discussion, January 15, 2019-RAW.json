These are the periods where the real building happens, after the heavy load on the network during the last run up identified and helped prioritize where improvement is needed most. I remember many of the exact same discussions, same troll posts, same bullshit naive comments saying bitcoin will be replaced (It won't - it will be improved). etc. So there is a lot of similarity but we'll have to wait and see. There are definitely new developments in the works with proposed ETFs, bakkt, etc, so who knows.",

These could easily increase demand, and now there are also talks that the platform operators are considering adding other digital-assets. 2019 will likely see an expansion of the crypto payments sector, and partnerships like the one between Ledger and Crypto.com. A study from Visual Capitalist report shows the number of brick-and-mortar shops accepting cryptocurrencies grew by 30.3% in nearly 11,300 retailers worldwide. Plus, their forecast shows that the e-commerce and payments sector will experience exponential growth by 2021, rising from $528.2 billion to $885.4 billion. Then there's stablecoins which offer a convenient and safe place to put funds as Bitcoin and altcoins whipsaw back and forth for banks and businesses looking to enter in crypto. Oh and payments companies like Nexo, FOTON Bank and Revolut are already making it easier for crypto-holders looking to acquire capital or make crypto payments quickly and bypass taxable conversions. Lastly, the dev team are still working on bitcoin upgrades and new ideas for layering and sidechains, etc.\n\nSo no, you're not right.",
