What a Wall Street Chart Tells Us About Bitcoin\u2019s Price\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/panic-mode-what-a-wall-street-chart-tells-us-about-bitcoins-price](https://www.coindesk.com/panic-mode-what-a-wall-street-chart-tells-us-about-bitcoins-price)\n\n \n\nInvesting in financial markets can be an emotional roller-coaster and the bitcoin market is no exception.\n\nWhen it comes to investment, human emotions tend to oscillate between two extremes \u2013 fear and greed \u2013 and the constant balancing act between the two creates a cycle of market emotions. \u00a0\n\nFor years, traders and investors alike have studied the cycle of market emotions with the help of a chart known as the \u201cWall Street Cheat Sheet.\u201d (See link at top for picture).\n\nAs seen above, at the top of the market cycle is \u201ceuphoria\u201d \u2013 a point of maximum financial risk.\n\nThis is the time when investors think nothing can go wrong and a self-feeding cycle is established: more investors enter the market for its stellar returns, leading to a further rise in price and valuations reach dizzying heights before, eventually, reality bites hard.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market was gripped by euphoria in the last quarter of 2017. Bitcoin prices rose from $6,000 to $20,000 within seven weeks on speculation that futures launch would open floodgates for large institutions to buy cryptos.\n\nFurther, every other altcoin, regardless of its fundamental story, had rallied to record highs by the first week of January. Most pundits came out with bitcoin targets of $50,000 or more at the time.\n\nThe bubble, however, was pricked just two weeks into January by a regulatory crackdown in China and South Korea \u2013 two of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies back then.\n\n## Where are we now?\n\nSince then, the bitcoin market has arguably gone through \u201ccomplacency,\u201d \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201cdenial.\u201d\n\nIn this interpretation, the denial stage, it could be argued, lasted for five months as BTC\u2019s repeated defense of $6,000 offered hope that the broader market and altcoins with strong fundamentals would recover lost ground before the year-end.\n\nThose hopes, however, were shattered as BTC nosedived below $6,000 on Nov. 14, pushing the bitcoin market into the \u201cpanic\u201d stage, causing investors to look for an exit with no price floor in sight.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has since fallen nearly 50 percent from the $6,000 mark, trading at an average price of $3,327 according to CoinDesk data at press time. More importantly, trading volumes jumped more than 30 percent month-on-month in November. That high-volume sell-off likely indicates many weaker hands have left the market.\n\nThe argument for capitulation not having set in yet is that it is usually a single extreme selling event, short in duration but backed by a surge in sell volume and subsequent buy volume.\n\nAs recent as Nov. 1, bitcoin suffered just that and it seems panic is still the most likely candidate for bitcoin\u2019s current stage in its market cycle, at least until a break below the psychological price level of $3,000 incites capitulation.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nThe result of capitulation is a lengthy period of sideways price action and misery felt by investors.\n\nSo this leaves us studying the market cycle\u00a0after recent violent price drops, searching for visual cues of a \u201cbottoming out\u201d of the current bear trend.\n\nAnd by having examined the different cycles it\u2019s safe to assume bitcoin is close, but not quite there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first stage after capitulation is \u2018anger,\u2019 when investors look for some reason for the horrific losses they\u2019ve just experienced.\u00a0\n\nFinally, reality sets in for investors who then shift from feeling anger to \u201cdepression\u201d in regards to the financial state they are left in and this is when the bottom hits.\n\nWhen all hope in the market is lost in the eyes of the public, the market quietly starts to pick up a bid. At this stage, investors have been emotionally battered to the extent they will not believe any rally from here on out can be sustainable.\n\nAlthough it may be hard to grasp, this point of what seems like utter disaster can be seen as the point of maximum financial opportunity and minimum risk. With all the sellers now out of the market, accumulation at basement prices can begin, which eventually provides the energy for the start of the next market cycle.\n\nLike billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously said, be \u201cfearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d",

Every penny mattered.\n\nThen in 2017 it finally became possible but it was obviously too late - irrational exuberance had already taken hold. I told myself I'd buy in if it ever dropped to $2k, safe in the knowledge it probably wouldn't.  \n\nBut now here we are, it's a real possibility. I've got 50k that I could afford to lose without affecting my quality of life and if the price goes to 2k I will have a real decision to make. Risk a lot of money or risk living with regret again. I can't be the only no-coiner hanging around thinking like this.",

You can open payment channels for any commerce.

When they experience a loss, they re-examine the fundamental assumptions they made initially to see if they\u2019re still valid.

It's not about how low it goes, most people with insight and time in this space agree that it will go back up of course - it's a market, but nobody is foolish enough to pretend they know when. It's become a very real active market, and one that is growing rapidly. \n\nIn markets, you buy bear and sell bull. Sounds easy enough, but guessing the bottoms and tops only appear easy when looking back on charts. It's not easy looking forward. Some are saying $3250 is bottom, others are saying as low as $2500. Nobody knows, and if you average down you reduce your break even point and will eventually be buying the bottom. Those buys at bottom will return gains as soon as the recovery begins. Ignore noise, Ignore ridiculous claims both high and low, ignore trolls and FUD. The path Bitcoin is on has already been etched into progression. Bitcoin has already started to sync with the social collective program of human society, and seems very likely to continue evolving. Everything is data. Good luck!! ",

To all those people who HODLed between 2014-2016, shout out to them because they were rewarded handsomely. Patience is a virtue. Bitcoin does not rise when you want it at the snap of a finger. It\u2019s a very volatile asset class, one that will experience much more turbulence in the years to come. All you can do is HODL and not pay attention to the current price.",

There is a fabulous tool over at http://worldbitcoinnetwork.com/BitcoinPriceModel-Alpha.html  that let's you plug in a few variables, and it will calculate the per coin price based on your estimates. When I use the tool with my best estimates, I get about $20k. That is a figure that I have held as what i consider a realistic target since 2013 - ie well before the momentary 20k market spike last year.",

            "Text": "Genuine adoption as a currency would also imply that Bitcoin has a relatively stable rate of exchange.  The last week or so where the price has moved within a narrow trading band would actually be ideal if Bitcoin were actually a currency.\n\n\nBut Bitcoin isn\u2019t really a currency.  HODLers really see it as an investment.  But if it\u2019s not being used as a currency, then it\u2019s actual value as an asset is negligible.\n\n\nWall Street is mostly done with Bitcoin.  The SEC and Chinese authorities also weren\u2019t too pleased with irrational exuberance and massive bubble at the beginning of the year, and will seek to regulate it in the future.  And so many \u201cregular Joe\u201d investors got burned on the most recent bubble (or saw their friends get burned) that they\u2019re not ever coming back.\n\n\nSo this leaves Bitcoin\u2019s price largely dependent on the cost it takes to mine it.  And those miners need to offload their newly-mined coins as quickly as possible for that \u201cuseless fiat\u201d to pay for real electricity bills.  And as long as bitcoin mining produces negative returns or minescule profits, miners are in serious trouble because they still need to pay for 1) electricity, 2) property taxes on the mining farms, and 3) loans they might have taken from banks to rapidly expand and mine at scale.  I think even if the difficulty of mining a block decreases as more miners go offline, the above three fixed costs could lead to terminal decline in the mining industry (and ultimately lead to further drops in price per coin).",
