If you missed getting out near the top, then you should have sold on the first dead-cat bounce, and waited to re-enter after a new high was achieved, or shorted after the dead cat began to fall again. Even if Bitcoin was at $40K right now, there was evident price exhaustion at December's blow-out top, which required traders to step aside. HODLing without a strategy is like burying your head in the sand.",

In other words, increased adoption does not drive up the price.  \n\nIn fact, it is the opposite.

If you missed getting out near the top, then you should have sold on the first dead-cat bounce, and waited to re-enter after a new high was achieved, or shorted after the cat began to fall again. Even if Bitcoin was at $40K right now, there was evident price exhaustion at December's blow-out top, which required traders to step aside.  HODLing without a strategy is like burying your head in the sand.",

If that doesn't happen we may have a support level here. Technical analysis is almost never down to the dollar. The other thing that is getting overlooked is where the big players have agreed to defend the price. I can almost promise you a lot of the major wallets all know each other and all chat with each other to some degree. It would absolutely blow my mind if they did not come up with various strategies. When I look at the trade index a lot of it is retail investors. All kinds of 50 to $1,000 orders popping off. \n\nI actually asked Charlie Lee about this a few hours ago on Twitter. I said remember 2017, in December when you were warning about the market getting hot? What's your opinion of it right now? I'll just cut and paste his reply\n\nMarket does what market does. It's correcting and consolidating. Could be quick, could be slow to recover.\n\nWhat he said is what any non-emotional logical person would come to for conclusion. \n",

Whatever the price was to be in the future, up or down, it would have been best to get-off and back-on, rather than staying in your seat, willing to accept a long ride over the cliff in wishing on a future star.

On the one hand there could be one last exhaustive push. On the other it would surprise me if all the YouTube stars were actually right because that's what they are expecting. \n\nThere is a near-certainty that large hands have already agreed on where they will defend the price. None of us little people really know where that is but we can guess that the $6,000 number has been in play all year. Now if you really wanted to run in some short sellers you could allow the market to drop to 57 5800. They are going to start piling in as 6000 is taken out. Give it a couple of days and Pile in the money. Get to 7000 within the hour.\n\nPlan B is just let the market Trend sideways. Let the retail investors sell themselves out. Let all of the depression and despair run its course\n\nI'm personally not that concerned with what is going to happen this year. My eyes are on regulation and getting something formal that allows an Institutional ETF and eventually a retail ETF. In order for this Market to move substantially higher the big money funds have got to come into it and they will once certain criteria have been met. If it goes to 5k. Oh well. If it goes to 10 or 15k to me it changes nothing other than how much coin I can accumulate. None of those numbers really interest me",

The current rumor that was getting floated is that there was manipulation in the market and what you're seeing and a huge part of this price drop has  been it unwinding. I think bitfinex and the others know eventually they can't continue to run. Once they have cleaned up the books and everything is Peachy there will be some kind of an announcement to say look we have everyone's money here. There are this many tether tokens and we have this many US dollars. The only real problem I can see from the United States perspective is the way tether is right now, it's a security. It's not decentralized. It's a product that you put US Dollars into and expect a return. I have no idea how that one is going to play out but I think this whole usdt thing is going to come to some kind of conclusion over the next 12 to 18 months",

Nope - he will just buy the needed quantify for $100.\n\nSo the entire notion that adoption will increase price is baloney.

Kennedy**\n\nJohn Fitzgerald \"Jack\" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 \u2013 November 22, 1963), commonly referred to by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. He served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his presidency dealt with managing relations with the Soviet Union. As a member of the Democratic Party, Kennedy represented the state of Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate prior to becoming president.\n\nKennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.\n\n***\n\n**Stephen A. Douglas**\n\nStephen Arnold Douglas (April 23, 1813 \u2013 June 3, 1861) was an American politician from Illinois and the designer of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. He was a member of the House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 1860 election, losing to Republican Abraham Lincoln. Douglas had previously defeated Lincoln in a Senate contest, noted for the famous Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates of 1858. He was nicknamed the \"Little Giant\" because he was short in physical stature, but a forceful and dominant figure in politics.\n\n***\n\n**Wendell Willkie**\n\nWendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 \u2013 October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin.\n\nWillkie was born in Elwood, Indiana, in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

This is why I'm not a total conspiracy theorist about tether because from a few different angles it's actually in their interest to stonewall until they figure out another system to use for US dollars.

They are adjusted to meet demand when it is possible.  Your assertion was that demand lowers the price and that just isn't true as we saw last year with GPU prices.\n   \nYou also said above that the price of mobile phones dropped with adoption and that is not true either.  If you compare certain models that have had a persistent production, then those may have fallen in price because the cost of fabrication has lowered over time.  But the cost of the best selling phone has gone up.  Meaning that the mobile phone in demand has done nothing but go up year over year.  Just go look at iPhone prices and what it cost for the latest iPhone for an example.\n  \nYou're ignoring a lot of factors and the result is that you are wrong.",

You and I also both know that as a norm, we have been paying lower prices for higher GPU performance year after year.  \n\nOf course you can continue to pay higher prices for a premium iPhone but doesn't the last model continue to plumper in price?  You can pay for a more expensive Internet package but don't you get far better performance?  It is a GIVEN that we have been paying lower prices for the same Internet performance year after year.\n\nI seriously don't understand why you want to debate an obvious fact of modern life - that we pay increasingly less for the same performance where tech commodity products are concerned.\n\nOf course adoption must be tied to merchants.  They are the ones that dictate where BTC is used as a currency and not just for speculation (which delivers ZERO economic value).",
