That said it won\u2019t let me see any fees until I transfer the amount I want to spend, and as I\u2019m planning to buy quite a bit, I\u2019m reluctant to do it until I\u2019m sure Coinbase is the right place.\n\nI also heard it can take a a long time to get your bitcoin from Coinbase, whereas localbitcoin can be instant. Is the rate you buy at locked in at the time you buy?\n\nA lot of questions, I know, but if you have answers to any of them I\u2019d be really grateful. ",

Do you (or anyone else for that matter) know if it\u2019s possible to buy bitcoin with gdax and then transfer it to Gemini at a later date? And if so, are the any fees associated with doing that. \n\nI\u2019m planning to invest in some alt coins too and as far as I understand I can do that with gdax or Coinbase and so hopefully there is an easy way to transfer coins from one to another.",
