That's still way more than you'll get when placing your money in a bank. The most modern societies and governments like in South Korea are slowly beginning to adopt blockchain. Altcoins? Not so much.  Only a couple of them may have a future. The rest is pretty much useless, maybe only to gamble. Everyone can make a blockchain. It's going to be easy in the future.  ",

[You can keep an eye on volatility here](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/) (the lower volatility, the higher the stability). I took a look at prices around April 19th 2016 (volatility was 0.74%) and October 11th 2016 (0.58%) in order to come up with that three month number. Current volatility is 1.71%, so it still has room for lower numbers. ",

Now I'm not saying its going to cyclically continue 1000% gains yearly, that is unrealistic, but its ability to grow is still massive considering the small market cap it has right now (nowhere near the cap of infrastructure and housing). Most people today still don't know what bitcoin even is and if they have heard of it, they usually don't know more than it's an \"internet speculative investment\", if bitcoin or some other coin becomes a normal part of life, it has a ways to go in my opinion, not to mention its software can change with the time and solve problems that come up along the way while reducing transaction costs and possibly drawing huge institutional investors",

The speculation period is where the big gains are made. Everyone is afraid to miss the boat. That feeling and hype can simply not come back in the same way cause after a while we will know the true value of crypto. It's when people don't know what the true value is, that big gains are made. It took Microsoft 17 years to get back at ath of 2000. Cryptotime is faster, so let's say 4-6 years before btc is back at ath. Still a good long term investment but crazy times are over.",

Even on Jan 6th, this number was just about 20 million.  That does not look like a lot unless you say that a very significant number of people hold their bitcoin in exchange addresses. \n\nI live in a major western country and I have yet to meet any work colleagues or friends who have bought crypto (other than ones who bought some because of me telling them about it).\n\nSeems evident to me that we are indeed at a very early stage notwithstanding last December.",

If so, their USD withdrawals have been in limbo for about a week because of their banking problems. I haven't heard about BTC transactions, so you might still be able to buy on Bitfinex and sell on Coinbase. Either way, something's up because that's a large enough spread you should be able to make some money doing arbitrage.\n\nEdit: Oh, this is related to Binance.

            "Text": "You have some points, but the past is the past. This asset/coin has been touched by the mass. Once that happens, it's a different ballgame. If you look at december, how many people were investing in it. We're talking about aunts and uncles that never heard of btc before. Average joe. That's really the maximum this speculative coin can achieve for now. Now, if you're talking about adoption as a payment method, the only way it can be a payment method is if there's no volatility. If there's no volatility, it can't give huge gains. It's one thing or the other, it cannot be both.\n\nAlso, the reason of the huge gains in 2017 were that nobody knew what the real value of btc and crypto was. As time goes by, we will learn what the real value is. The real value is always lower than the speculative value in bullish speculative periods when the value isn't known, untill it slowly and gradually goes up. You only have to look at the past to see this pattern. See online companies in 2000s for example. We pretty much know what the value of Microsoft is now, so there will never be a huge price increase like in 1999. Btc is probably the same. Once the real (practical) value is known, there is no reason to speculate so much on it, cause speculation is based on expectation. This expectation was huge in 2017 and probably won't come back. Again, if you're talking about btc as a payment method, adoption could grow. But it cannot be a payment before volatility is gone.",
