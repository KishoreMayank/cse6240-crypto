Also it helped to download the blockchain on my desktop PC using an external hard drive then I used that external hard drive for the PI so it didn't have to download everything from scratch.

It's use as a currency will likely emerge from the very fact that more and more people will possess it... as a result of it becoming more and more easy to obtain as technical barriers are coming down. \nThat being said, this is years down the road and for now, children are taught to measure currency in Fiat ..not Satoshies. Bitcoin will supplement FIAT before it replaces it, because you can't skip to step D without going through A, B and C. \nTill then we measure in the currency we know and were raised on. Bitcoin will likely continue to evolve and if history has taught us anything, it's that you invest in a rising technology BEFORE it becomes mainstream.",

But if you just bought it to trade or thinking it's gonna suddenly make you a lot of money, then you are very wrong and will lose money. I assume you bought it high on 24th, right now it is on a downtrend about to bounce to an up trend maybe above 8000 again, but there is no guarantee.\n\nSo if you have no trading knowledge but want to make quick money, then give it a couple days and maybe sell at a reasonable little profit, don't think it's gonna just shoot up to $50000 all of sudden, that's stupidity. Or just hodl for long term for few months to years, but just get out when shit goes south as fuck. ",

Although I'll say you bought at kind of a bad time (even if 07/24 was a green day) because many things got together for BTC's price to drop. (Expiration of CME's contract and BTC's ETF rejection everything in last week's second half) I mean it would be bad if you were here exclusively for trading.\n\nIf you are here for the long run then there is a good chance you will end up on the green if you play your cards nicely. What will be pivotal is if ETF's proposal gets accepted or rejected, so put attention in that in the future as that may play a big role for BTC's general future, so yeah, that alone may be the start of something beautiful or the infamous end of the line for bitcoin.",

With all the online information gathering and leaks that happened in recent years, it's no longer reasonable to punch all of your personal information into websites just so you can make a credit card payment for legit services. With crypto, I can pay to a service without them ever knowing who I am, so long as they don't need that information to provide service(AWS for instance would need to know something about you so you don't do illegal stuff like running botnets). There's no reason for Netflix to know my home address for streaming services. \n\nAnd there is incentive for companies to adopt this model too, because it allows them to spend less effort on trying to protect that data that they never really needed in the first place. And they no longer need to deal with the cost and difficulty and risk of integrating with CC payment processors.\n\nSo yeah, maybe it won't be the best choice for buying daily coffee, but it might be the best choice for the online equivalent of buying coffee, like paying your netflix bill.

You want to buy coffee and suddenly the price drops with 10 percent. So, atm it's not a reliable currency. It's either something you specualte on or a currency, it cannot be both. Btc coud be a daily currency in the future if price stabilizes, but we are probably far away from that moment, and that's a good thing, cause we want to make gains.  ",
