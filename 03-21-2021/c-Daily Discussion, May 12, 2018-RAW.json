Realistically the price won't change that much until technology catches up to push block chain to the next step where \"Normies\" will be able to easily access cryptos. The sad truth is most people are low IQ and don't understand technology or it's implications. The internet has been around since like the 70s and 80s... but it wasn't widely accepted until maybe the 90s and didn't explode until the 2000's. It's important that we have patience and stay focused. Bitcoin will skyrocket but it won't be overnight. Just slowly accumulate bitcoin and don't look at the price. Think of it as an investment that will payout in the future, if you get caught up in day trading or selling every time you feel FUD you will get tore up with paying taxes on it. ",

It's the safest bet, but it's actually the worst investment strategy. If you are able to see a market correction coming, either by hunch, or seeing it start to happen using TA, you can greatly increase your position by selling as the knife starts to fall and buying back in when it hits bottom. If you sell 3 bitcoin at $10k each and buy them back at $5k that's doubling your position. Much better strategy then HODLing. Problem is it's risky... but so is crypto. ",

That makes no sense at all. When are butters going to learn that people *like* debt? It works for people and it works for governments. Being able to borrow money when you need it is a good thing. \n\nOr perhaps you pay cash for everything? No auto loans or credit cards or mortgage? ",
