Download the core client as others have said\n2. Wait for it to sync (this will take days)\n3. Replace the wallet.dat file with your BTCwallet.dat file (located in \\Users\\YourUserName\\Appdata\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\wallet.dat if you are on a PC). Rename it to wallet.dat\n4. Restart the core program\n5. See whats up",

If you believe in a future where more people own bitcoin and potentially use it as a currency, store of value etc., then it makes no difference if you bought at 3500 or 4k. Personally, after the rollercoaster ride of the past few years, none of the current price movement makes a lot of difference unless you're trading daily. Anything under 6k is a good entry point if you're looking long term.",

I wouldn't expect the file to be corrupt if the drive hasn't been wiped or re-formatted since. even then there should be a good chance it is fine. copy/paste to other locations shouldn't corrupt it either, just keep the original copy in case.
