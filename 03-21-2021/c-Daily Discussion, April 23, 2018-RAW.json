PBS did a segment the other day on Bitcoin and a reporter put 20 dollars into a Bitcoin-ATM and only got 13 dollars worth of Bitcoin. This is a PR nightmare in the making. We should not be defending this behavior with free market arguments we should be boycotting these ATM operators. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APIyzN6f_Lg&feature=youtu.be&t=2093",

Following the plunge, the cryptocurrency's price declined to as low as $6,593 on March 30, reflecting what is now a 39% gain since that market bottom.",

I can't imagine my mother in law purchasing some obscure utility token, for example, but maybe bitcoin eventually. Bitcoin is also easier to buy than most alts, which require purchasing bitcoin or one of the other 'big' coins first.\n\nWhether to hold any more BTC obviously depends on your opinions and goals - my personal feeling is that alts are *much* higher risk/reward - much more likely to crash hard, but also more likely to 10x / 100x in a short time period.",

Since most alts are traded on a crypto to crypto basis, with btc pairings accounting for the most volume, a sudden rise in btc would cause a sudden rise in the dollar value of an alt coin/token regardless of its satoshi value. Market sentiment may either agree or disagree with this new valuation and will react accordingly. For example, the market may feel that a certain alt coin/token is now overpriced and will correct its satoshi value to a point by which its dollar value seems more reasonable. Generally speaking though, the better/more unique/more useful the project is the more encouraging its reaction will be to a bullish move in bitcoin, although frankly it's pretty hard to know this until after the fact has occurred hence the Efficient Market Hypothesis.",

Many Bitcoin investors are getting impatient and frustrated with Bitcoin remaining stagnant while Bitcoin has repetitively shown gains of 20% everyday. Eventually, when the cryptocurrency market falls again in the new few weeks, Bcash will be the biggest loser. And it could happen exactly around or before the Bitcoin ABC fork being released on May 15th. Thus, I would not encourage anyone to believe to stick with Bcash until the fork is released. That\u2019s purely speculation, you still have to be very cautious. ",

For most people with investments that small, it's \"screw around\" money anyway and losing it won't be devastating financially.  And if $500 *is* a life-changing amount of money, why the hell are you investing it in crypto? \n\nI have less than $500 invested and keep all my coins on desktop wallets.  Yeah it isn't the most secure storage method, but as long as the user has good safety practices it's pretty good. ",
