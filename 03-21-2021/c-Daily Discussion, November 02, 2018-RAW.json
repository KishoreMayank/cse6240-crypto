Everyone with a brain knows that crypto will be the payment method of the millennium generation when they enter the labour market and start thinking about their financial situation. Why would the millennium generation give a shit about banks? They want instant gratification, they want control over their own money, they don't want time delay, they don't respect old institutions, they are willing to take more risks, they believe in technology. Crypto and blockchain was the invention that perfecty fits into the needs of the new generation. \n\nPeople need to invest during periods of LOW volatility. Not when price goes up, not when it goes down. LOW VOLATILITY. The time is now. It can go a bit lower, but you can't time the perfect moment. Get your money out of your bankaccount and invest when nobody else invests cause the sheeple are waiting for 'something to happen'. You just DO NOT invest when something happens. You invest when NOTHING happens. ",

If there will report only 5% of people, nobody will force it. Chose your side. Will you give bully your launch at the first day at school and keep giving it to him for rest of your life, or you will fight to have the right to not give it to them on first day? Same situation with taxes... Crypto is currency, not asset. Did any court in Finland yet ruled it in one of this category? or you just blindly follow \"recommendation from national bank\" or \"by tax advisors\" ?",

If you only have 1 UTXO of 1 BTC, you would queue up the whole amount and it would automatically enter it in rounds of .10.\n\nNot sure if it only does 1 round of .10 and change the rest or if it will mix the whole btc. I would expect the latter. I've not used it with enough BTC to go through multiple cycles. \n\n/u/nopara73 would have a better answer. ",
