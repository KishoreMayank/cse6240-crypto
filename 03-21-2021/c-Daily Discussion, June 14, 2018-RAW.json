How is that possible?\n\n2- I understand (I guess) the aspect of public ledger, but what stops a node from including a false transaction (from A to B) and  getting lucky by solving that block before the others, wouldn\u2019t this get actually broadcasted to other nodes as solved block and registered in blockchain even if it had false data? Or does transactions gets broadcasted to all nodes (before solving the block) as shared memory pool, so they \u201cvote\u201d on the validity of the content too?\n\n3- I read that we can generate wallet keys offline, isn\u2019t it possible that 2 wallets might end up with the same random keys?",

Good luck getting mainstream adoption when one of the more popular communities/website for BTC information has very little actual reasonable discussion.\n\nWhy is it that seemingly everyone is so focused on price manipulation by whales as the reason why the price has been coming down?  Although by nature, this currency is EASILY manipulated, the most likely reason for me seems to be the cold shoulder that the public has turned to BTC.  Back in December, everyone and their grandmas bought into BTC because they saw it's meteoric rise and equated it to fast and easy money.  Now that the idea of the easy money train is gone, I think the general public realizes that BTC is nowhere close to mass adoption, and in it's current form, will never be viable for anything resembling mass adoption.",

If a block contains an invalid transaction, it is not a valid block and so it is not in the blockchain, as far as every other (well-behaved) node is concerned. The node in your question would be hard-forking into a chain that only it is following.\n\n3. Yes. It is also possible that I will get hit by a meteor while being hit by lightning in the middle of summer. I think the key collision is slightly less probable. OTOH, if the randomness generator used by the wallets suck, it can become a lot more probable (see Debian's OpenSSH bug)",

            "Text": "1- You can be lucky and have an almost instant confirmation, and by that I mean an actual confirmation. If you send your transaction right before a block is found, and the miner decides to include it in the block.  It takes on average 10 minutes, but not 10 minutes since you sent your transaction, 10 minutes since the last block. You could send your transaction at minute 9:30 and get it in the next block.  You will also see your transaction in block explorers before this happens. The transaction is in the mempool waiting to be added by a miner. Depending on the fee, they will add it in the next block or not.  \n\n2- Nodes can include false transactions. But then if they're not valid, other nodes will ignore it and not distribute it. The miner would lose the mining reward, and that blockchain would be forgotten.\n\nMiners can't add a transaction from YOUR address. So nobody can even try to do that. Miners just get transactions, validate them, and then put them in the block. If a transaction is not valid, they won't include it in the block. (or else they lose a lot of potential income). Nobody votes on the validity. It's either valid or invalid. If a transaction is seeing as valid by some nodes, then it will fork, and die.\n\nNodes validate transactions, just because it's in the blockchain doesn't mean that the nodes will accept it. My full node will validate all the transactions in the block, and not accept them if they're not valid.\n\n3- It would take in the order of several times the age of the universe for there to be 2 equal keys if they are generated truly randomly. You actually don't confirm that nobody has that key when you generate a new address. Even if you're online. And if you do, then you're the luckiest son of a bitch ever. It's just not going to happen.",

As i saw this pumping market i sold them with good profit, everything else would be stupid\n\nnow you have the possibility to easily change fiat to bitcoin and use it for payment or to send money and the technology is getting better and more people will use it, but it won't be bitcoin in the future, because there are more efficient cryptocurrencies to do so, so there is no reason for a value like 100k, 50k, 20k\n\nthe thing I want to say, there must not be a revolution, but use bitcoin and other currencies for the thing they were invented for\n\nor keep dreaming mr. investor",

What seems to be happening after these dips, is that the volume rises and then starts to go down slowly, until there are no more buyers... \n\nBitcoin is also at a psychological region. Since the price has rocketed twice from this location, newbies will now suffer from the [hot-hand fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_hand), thinking that what has happened in the past, will have a greater probability of happening again.\n\nBut what trading strategies tell us is that if a chart outcome can be easily predicted, then it can also be easily exploited.",

As long as traders are unaware of willfully ignorant, they act as if Tether is backed one-to-one.\n\nThere's no point in changing Tether to another constant value if its price is not going to fluctuate noticeably.

The fundamentals of Bitcoin are still sound and it is by far the most decentralised coin and least likely to fall to a 51% node attack. Unless some other cryptocurrency surpasses it, there will be people waiting until there is blood on the streets before buying (and by that I mean when even the hodlers are selling). And it would be astonishing if people weren't holding Bitcoin sheerly for speculative purposes, that's pretty much how proto-currencies developed before governments.",

The thing is suposedly tamper proof so I guess the private key is safer on it than on an infected computer.\n\nThe seed (the 12 or 24 word you are mentioning) has to be stored on paper in a safe place and has to be copied by hand and not on a computer.

Bitcoin only has real value for shady dealings and it's really hard to determine how big that market is. Plus other cryptos can be used for that as well. Although understandably this is where size matters. Decentralisation in itself is pretty much irrelevant as long as the transaction continue to happen. I really can't see an investment thesis for bitcoin other than for example a crisis currency or illegal business currency. IMO the litmus test for bitcoin will be the next bigger recession. When money moves out of assets, will it also move out of bitcoin ? Or in to bitcoin like gold. That's the real test. Markets are moving into bubble territory, so right now it's impossible to say if the current price is justified or is it just froth. Since it's use cases are so limited, I suspect the latter.",

            "Text": "Blockchain has everything to do with the value of Bitcoin because its successful operation enables transaction ledgers without a third party to enforce trust. Other cryptos do not do this as effectively right now because they are all more centralised, which provides a de-facto third party to the ledger (even if their role is generally hands-off) and Bitcoin has by far the most tried-and-tested blockchain against malicious nodes. Both of these facts make other cryptocurrencies a riskier proposition, both against hackers and co-option by the developers, and a successor to Bitcoin will have to overcome both of these points.\n\nOnce again, your argument against Bitcoin as a viable currency rests on things that are typical features of a proto-currency. Bubbles are a necessary consequence of organic interest in something as a store of value. Its use case a means of exchange is limited by the opportunity cost of spending Bitcoin. You don't get to skip those stages of formation of a currency, unless its heavily centralised.",

            "Text": "In principle, banks can block your transactions or freeze your account. There is no guarantee that whatever the law is now will continue to be the law in future (we see this with hate speech laws in Western nations that otherwise grant freedom of speech). For those who are not willing to take that risk, cryptocurrencies provide an alternative way of storing and spending money.\n\nYou should be concerned about monetary policy because governments can print fiat to leverage economic planning. This causes inflation, which has the side effect of devaluing your savings in the long run. Bitcoin may be deflationary in the here and now, but it is asymptotically stable, which means governments can't inflate it by issuing more of them.\n\nNow as to holding onto currency - yes, hodling is stupid. Holding onto your coins through thick and thin deprives the market of the liquidity it needs to converge on a stable value (as well as exposing the hodler to far bigger losses than if he had sold at a loss and then bought back in at a fraction of the price): however, hodling was a necessary first stage in Bitcoin's existence as an item of novelty. Without it, nobody would have ascribed any appreciable value to it. Now Bitcoin is in the second stage, which is speculation. Speculation cannot be bypassed in an organic proto-currency because stable price levels can't be found without it. Once again, these are very normal features of a proto-currency.\n\nNow governments and central banks won't give up power over fiat currency, or currency in general for that matter, but that's not a fair claim to have to defend. What matters is that governments and central banks will have to make concessions to cryptocurrencies, which limits their influence over their destiny to a lower degree. The development of the internet decentralised information. Governments didn't outright give up everything to the internet free of charge (like copyrighted music), but once again,the internet became big enough that governments had to play ball. That kind of leverage is exactly what we're seeing developing now.\n\nThe end goal is that crypto will next be used in daily transactions, but the price of everyday goods with be tethered to fiat (so if Bitcoin undergoes a ~5% fluctuation upwards with respect to the local fiat, the cost of a good will decrease by ~5% in Bitcoin, leaving the equivalent fiat price the same). Once that phase is over, everyday good and services would be priced using crypto as base units. That's the long term trajectory and it's a long way off happening, but the current market cycles are absolutely necessary for this to happen.",
