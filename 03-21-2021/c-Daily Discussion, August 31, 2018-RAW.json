Thin buy sell walls are an ominous sign of two things: (1) little activity and low Bitcoin volume, (2) a mechanism by Bitcoin whales to control the price meanwhile testing the market. They are looking for large hidden orders, testing the variation in the order books and checking for any major news stories. Bitcoin whales are very patient because they are in the driver seat. The rest of us are in the passenger seat some fearing for our lives while other hoping to experience a joyride. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin whales are currently driving the car at about 30 mph. Really the most important thing for HODLers is to remain in the car and buckle up tight. It\u2019s going to be a long journey and any of those who think they can hop out of the car and hitchhike into a faster car will end up being left behind. Don\u2019t end up a hitchhiker. Stay HODLing.",

            "Text": "It costs money to mine Bitcoin, so it's not like printing $7,000 bills at all. Even in the best case with 'free' electricity somehow (hydro dam, solar cells, turbines, etc.), miners and associated power regulation equipment are expensive to buy and to maintain and to house.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin especially in the lower bounds reflects pretty well how much it costs to mine and get a *modest* return (i.e., enough to continue operating, get new equipment down the line etc.). \n\nAt economies of scale of course some people are making way more profit, e.g., GMO and Bitmain, but most miners will have a higher average cost per coin than them by a large amount.\n\nDifficulty has gone up an enormous amount since the days of $200 BTC, and the requirements to set up a profitable mine have increased as much as the price.\n\nIt's \"sort of\" inflationary in the sort term, but that's going to be the difference between the cost of mining and the sell price, not the full price of Bitcoin (e.g., the inflation is only the amount of profit the miner is making).\n\nThis is when Bitcoin is near the lower bound of its price, not during a bull run ala last year, at those times the profit margin is higher so that amount of \"inflation\" is a larger amount of fiat.\n\nOnce we hit the next two halvenings, few coins will be mined so the inflationary effect lessens, even if price of Bitcoin and the profit margin goes up for miners.\n\nOverall though, even with a high BTC price, the total amount of inflation is low compared to \"normal\" money printing inflation, just due to scale.",
