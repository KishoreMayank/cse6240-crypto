            "Text": "the book \"The Bitcoin Standard\" talks some about this. It suggests that trade would get a lot better, because there is no longer the uncertainty of exchange rates (which can change quickly due to politics). There are previous eras in history where this was the case due to a widely adopted gold standard, and trade blossomed during those times.\n\nIn addition to helping \"conventional\" trade, I think that BTC + LN opens up truly new avenues for trade. You can now send an instant, private, irreversible payment of sound money to anyone in the world for almost no fee, and no counterparty risk. We haven't even really gotten started in exploring what kinds of new possibilities that enables.",
