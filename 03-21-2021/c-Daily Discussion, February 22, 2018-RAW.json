So do what you're gonna do (probably buy high and sell low cause you're a bitch) but as long as you're truly abiding by what I consider to be the golden rule, which is to never invest more than you're ok with losing, than you really shouldn't be this emotionally invested.

            "Text": "From a purely TA perspective, there was a peak of 19k at 17-Dec followed by a big drop to 10k, a peak of 17k at 6-Jan followed by a drop to 9k, 12k peak at 28-Jan followed by drop to 6k. Each peak is lower than previous and also each drop more severe. Thus the recent recovery's failure to break 12k may be seen as significant and people may be expecting a drop below 6k. \n\nThe market can be self fulfilling. Personally, I think the fundamentals are a lot stronger now. And I hope the sentiments will also prove more positive. Just keeping my fingers crossed that TA will prove wrong here.",

Y'all are just reliving history of penny stocks, complete with the many exchange services that turned out to be scam artists who cut and ran.\n\nThe worst thing for Bitcoin as a currency is people who just hold onto it, hoping for their big payday.  If you want to gamble, there are less risky ways to gain the same profit than to follow whatever the 1000 people that make the top 40% make of the trends.  \n\nI mean shit, today's dip from news that doesn't actually affect Bitcoin and altcoin...it's clearly price manipulation and y'all are falling for it time and time again, with the least experienced people essentially giving their money away to the rich.

Surely this is really unprofitable and against their own interests? And if not, then I still don't understand how or why this happens?\n3) If they can choose, could this be an (attempted) way to combat criminal activity? I.e. the authorities could make it illegal for miners to include certain transactions known to be criminal? (Regardless of whether it would work in practice).",

The exchange rate between the two only influences the quantity of each being lost/gained.\n\nChanges in the exchange rate over time won't affect the amount of money you're holding at all.  If you're holding $1000 and 0.1BTC, then no matter whether it's $100/BTC or $100k/BTC, you're still holding the same amount of each.\n\nThe only way to end up with more or less of either type of money is to perform a second exchange in the other direction.  That is, if you exchange 0.1BTC for $1000 and then later exchange that $1000 for 0.05BTC, you've lost 0.05BTC.  Or if you exchange $1000 for 0.1BTC and then later exchange that 0.1BTC for $900, you've lost $100.",

            "Text": "**Byzantine fault tolerance**\n\nByzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the resistance of a fault-tolerant computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, towards electronic component failures where there is imperfect information on whether a component is failed. In a \"Byzantine failure\", a component such as a server can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure-detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a consensus regarding which component is failed in the first place. The term is derived from the Byzantine Generals' Problem, where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, but some of the actors are unreliable.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

            "Text": "Silly about what? I am dying to know. I didn\u2019t make a bet and I simply stated that it wouldn\u2019t break below 9.8 or somewhere near the area. I am not losing anything at all. Either your ill informed or failed to read the rest of the post. Either way - I can justify my point by letting you know that it stayed above 9.8 during the time I predicted it to be. But go ahead- tell me how I was wrong because it\u2019s at 9.6 arena now. Its ok Im a big boy. You see I\u2019ve been around this bitcoin thing for awhile now I\u2019ve survived Mt. Gox and I will surely survive irrelevant comments.",

Surely this takes seconds? This seems an infintesimally small drawback in order to collect all the fees from the next block to me?\n\nAnd in any case, could the protocol not prevent the mining of empty blocks by requiring at least one transaction to be included in each block? The network does not really benefit from mining empty blocks, and this would force miners to stop this practice?",
