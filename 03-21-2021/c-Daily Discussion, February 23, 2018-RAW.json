Their automated trading behavior leads new traders in cryptomarkets to overpay for the coins they are buying. The classic \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d scheme that was popular in the early nineties and made famous by the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is still being run effectively \u2014 by bots \u2014 in today\u2019s crypto markets. This scheme involves coordinated purchases of low-priced coin to \u201cpump\u201d the price and attract new investors who are easily excited by the increase. As investors unknowingly buy \u201cthe pump\u201d, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads \u2014 and agonizing over their wallets.",

There is already a large volume of trading bots operating in the market that the vast majority of investors aren\u2019t aware of. As investors become more savvy, so too will the bots. And so we\u2019re likely headed down the path of an arms race. As detection tools get stronger, developers will look for ways around detection. As bots get more advanced, platforms will accelerate research and development to counterattack. With regulation seemingly right around the corner, only time will tell which side will win the fight until the government steps in to stabilize the market and put an end to predatory bots.",

Invest some of those profits in lube though. \n\n",

            "Text": "Dumping btc in batches of 100+ at a time has nothing to do with depleted order books.\n\nUh-oh, btc is at 10500? Time to drive the price down. BAM, here's 112 btc. 1 minute later, BAM, here's another 100 btc. \n\nWhat rational seller would be dropping btc in batches, WITHOUT any negative outside info? If his intention was maximizing profits from the sale of these particular bitcoins, he'd sell them off in smaller numbers over time. But selling these particular bitcoins for max. profit isn't his intention - he wants to maximize his overall profit by driving the price down and then up again - selling 1k at $10K//bitcoin, hopefully creating snowball effect, thus driving the price down to let's say $8,5K, then buying 1K at this price, causing another snowball effect, driving the price up, selling.. etc. etc. Basically rinse/repeat. The problem is amplified by all the bot traders (especially the newbie bot traders, whose bots are set up in a predictable manner, so the true trader whales know how to play them). \n\nThis will stop (or at least be mitigated) once (and if) bitcoin reaches a much higher price and these so called \"whales\" won't be able to cause such market moves and once the main exchanges (public and taking fiat) impose their own rules or or have such rules forced onto them.\n \n",
