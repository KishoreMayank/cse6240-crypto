I think it makes it crystal clear that, as you say, they're critical.\n\nI can see us break up above $7.7k, giving bulls some moderate gains, and setting us in a good path to start the weekend from a solid position that could grow even further (unless it's a bull trap that bounces back down before most traders, especially those without robust TA, can realize their gains).\n\nHowever, looking at the RSI and MACD, there's also the danger that we could retrace back down under current support levels to below $6.9k or even further down (even crashing under the next Fibonacci support level), with the bears burning the moderate sell walls around the $7k price point, in which case we'll be at a worse position than right now and I'd then posit it'd be wise of savvy traders to revisit the different scenarios.",

This is probably the most bizarre reaction I have gotten to a comment in this entire subreddit. I mean the most peculiar part is the fact they keep pushing away auditors. If that were to happen on a regulated Bank the stock would be dropping well... a lot. Now I realize bitfinex is only one exchange but it is a very large part of the market.

It really is starting to make sense why some of the Doom and Gloom crowd is saying Bitcoin 4000 because really that's the worst case scenario. It's a technical repeat of 2014 and at the same time it's when the last audit of tether was actually done. On that last part it seems a little crazy unless they just went to town printing it because more people are involved in crypto now then there were in September of 2017. It does however help me understand the bearish argument a little. Then again I'm not sure how many of these bears actually realize  all of this",

I mean even if we assume the worst is true I don't see how this Compares with mount gox. That exchange was straight-up burglarized and collapsed. With bitfinex the worst case scenario appears to be a few people going to prison and confidence shaken along with a potential forced liquidation from the exchanges assets.. The thing is Bitcoin was around 3 to $4,000 before all of this began. We're coming up on one more year of growth. A lot of new people to the space. If anything to me that explains why we are at 7500. People are already nervous. Granted it may fall further if all this comes out in a news article but undercutting the price before all this began? Not even Mount gox did that. The parallel to 2014 however would be blatantly obvious",

I still don't see how you figure the price will collapse though because when Mount gox actually did collapse and all those Bitcoins were actually stolen the price still didn't collapse it merely dropped from 1000 to 200 which is an 80% drawdown. We already had a 70% draw down with the $6,000 bottom. 80% puts us at 4000. I realize a lot of people use tether to buy Bitcoin but someone holds those keys so worst case scenario if things are like that what you had was a lot of theft. Someone owns those Bitcoins. Back in September of 2017 they actually did have a one-to-one ratio from what's been printed. I have no idea I guess we just have to wait and see because there's just not enough evidence to come to a rational conclusion. Is there stuff we don't know? Probably. Do we have any idea what it is? You also have to wonder how much of this is already baked into the market price because we fell in January pretty hard and no one is really sure why. One thing that has been bouncing around in my head is the people at bitfinex really don't have any interest in prison and have been unwinding all this. That's why the drop has been so substantial.
