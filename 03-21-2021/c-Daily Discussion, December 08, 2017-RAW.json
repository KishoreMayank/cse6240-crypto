Then yesterday the price spiked and was all over the place, and today it has settled down. But the price stabilized  a good $2k-$3k higher than it was just a couple days ago. I dare you to keep your coin off-line so you arent tempted to make a rash decision, and then not check the price for a week. Come back next Friday and you will see people freaking out about the massive crash from $26k down to $23k, and you will be glad you saved money on heartburn medication.  ",

(before christmas..) or will I have to wait for Lightning? When is lightning going to be available in that case? \n\nAny other way to give btc? guess I could make a coinbase account for them.. but that seems dumb.\n\ne: Also will Lightning Network even work with paper wallets?

Maybe this has something to do with there being a large demand but also an inability to transfer bitcoin to be able to sell it (artificially reducing the supply). Just look at all the comments here from people asking about transactions and how long they are taking. \n\nReferences:\nUnconfirmed transactions: https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions\nCost per transaction: https://blockchain.info/es/charts/cost-per-transaction?timespan=1year\n\nWhat happens if the lightning network doesn\u00b4t come in time?\n\nedit: added links",

            "Text": "Well there\u2019s two ideas about CME and CBOE futures going around:\n1. Many people will short BTC, driving the price down and causing a major dip. This makes sense, since a massive correction usually happens with BTC once a month, and the futures release a month after the last major correction. \n2. A lot of new money from institutions will enter the stage. Even though futures don\u2019t deal directly with buying BTC, BTC will get more attention from institutions who might then decide to start investing, driving the prices up.\n\nEither way, we should all pay close attention to the price action when futures release Dec 10 and 17 and act accordingly.",

            "Text": "Been there, done that with FOREX back in 2008 - I was playing the carry trade with things like USD/JPY and USD/BRL coordinated buys, watching 12% annual interest rack up every day alongside whatever small price swings went (hopefully) in my favor. Constantly checking prices at work, not getting shit done.\n\nThen the housing bubble popped, the bottom fell out of the JPY, and all of my crazy over-leveraged (50:1) money got system-generated stop-loss'd to hell and gone and my money evaporated literally overnight. I lost ~90% of my investment. Thankfully it was just funny money I'd been putting in a paycheck at a time as I could spare it, not anything I really actually needed to survive.\n\nAfter that I closed my FOREX app, set some personal limits on how often I'd check on my stocks in Google Finance, and got back to work. I think it did a lot of good for my anxiety to intentionally limit obsession like that. It's also helped me learn how to set reasonable limit prices on things and wait for them - for example I just picked up some ETH at $425 early yesterday morning, when it's now back up to $457 and rising.\n\nA day like yesterday was crazy and I was watching more than normal to be sure...my advice is just to not let it take over your life in the long-term.",

            "Text": "It's a question of how much global cash actually comes pouring in relative to the current market cap of BTC. If the big boys of the system show up and suddenly can buy half the market, they can manipulate it basically to no end for their own profit. If they're a minority of the market then hopefully them all buying in just means the market grows and our BTC goes up.\n\nGiven the current market cap of around $300 billion, it'd take coordinated effort among a lot of major players to be another half of that, and human nature says that'd be hard to pull off...but we'll see come Sunday night I guess.",

It is a bit more complicated than that, but it is still basically true. So the fee would be the same(ish) if you are transferring $1 or $1M. This is because the fees are charged based on \"how much data does it take to describe the transaction\" which is more or less independent of the amount of the transaction. This can be compared to the fees we are used to with credit cards, pay pal, western union, etc. which are based on \"how much can we get away with charging.\"",

I believe it has to do with the mobile application interface shown in the image. \n\nIf you visit the Coinbase website on a web browser using a computer the forms will appear as amount one: $0.__ amount two: $0.__ where the \u201c$0.\u201d Is greyed out and the \u201c__\u201d are the field for you to enter text. This is significantly different than the mobile app display. \n\nSo if you received five cents and twelve cents, you would enter \u201c05\u201d and \u201c12\u201d in the provided text boxes.\n\nThis is an unfortunate flaw/bug with the mobile application interface, but is easily resolved by completing this step using a PC web browser.\n\nHope this helps =)",

            "Text": "Great article.\n\nHistorically, futures markets have increased volatility of the base asset. At the same time, they also allow users of the asset to buy it at a predictable price.\n\nSo if you are going to use bitcoin to actually do something, you don\u2019t have to worry about 50% daily volatility.\n\nFor example, if you are using bitcoin to do international cash transfers, this makes it a lot more valuable as you can plan out a schedule of transfers and lock in a price rather than being held to the whims of the market.\n\nIf etherium and cryptokitties get futures markets, that will make cat picture trading a lot more businesslike. You could plan ahead and lock in your trading prices and trades so you get your new breeding cat right at the cooldown rather than having to worry about having to buy $300 eth to get the cat you want at the right time.",

You sell it on day 366 at $10k, which gets you your $1000 back plus $1000 in profit. You owe taxes on the $1000 at the long term capital gains rate, which let's assume for you is 15%. So you netted $1000-15%=850.\n\nNow let's say you bought $1000 on day 1, worth at $10k, sold at $15k on day 100, now you have $1500 total. You rebuy at $12k on day 150 for the full $1500, and sell at $20k on day 200. You cash out and have $2500 now, or $1500 in total profit. But you owe the short terms capital gains rate, which is whatever your income tax bracket is (let's assume 25%). So you pay 25%*1500=$375 in taxes and get to keep $1125.\n\nIn this case, timing the market lets you come out ahead. But you can imagine that if you don't time it quite that well, it's easy to not come out ahead, because you have to overcome the additional tax burden of short term capital gains.\n\nIn the end, the vast, vast majority of people are better off just holding and/or DCAing and not trying to time the market. The one exception I'd make is if a big correction happens (20-30%), that's often a great time to increase your DCA and put a bunch in.",

Low fees, quick transactions, can buy the second you initiate a bank transfer. GDAX is popular and lower cost than Coinbase I hear, but I avoided them because they are affiliated with Coinbase and Coinbase burned me. With GDAX and Gemini you need to put in a limit order to buy, instead of a quick Buy it now style purchase like on Coinbase. It\u2019s simple to do but feels more technical.

I theoretically have some BTG, but the claiming / wallet situation seems sketchy still and I'm not gonna fuck with it. \n\nDiversification absolutely matters. Of course. That said, the percentages you've allotted make sense. You are diversified. Obviously Bitcoin has been gaining the most recently, but IOTA has the potential for massive returns long-term, and Litecoin is on a nice run in the last week. Ether is cool, but it's too stable to really be very fun. I mainly use it as a means of exchange for other coins so that I don't have to use my Bitcoin when I want to dip into some other alt coins.

Example: $11,000 limit, advanced limit $11,050. That is it'll fill anything inbetween $11,000 - $11,050. If you *don't* define that, the price could drop from $12,000 straight *past* the desired $11k price to say $9,000, and then you'd get stuck selling it off at $9k instead. Even if it rebounds from $9k back up to your desired price, doesn't matter if there was only a single limit trigger set. That's why defining a range is VERY helpful in sell situations. ",

My feeling at first was that futures might give Wall Street fat-cats a way to manipulate the price and drive it down, but the more I think  and read about it the more skeptical I'm getting whether that will actually be the case. In any event, I plan to take some fiat profits this weekend, just in case. If the price goes way up next week, I'll probably wish I would have just held (hodled?) it all, but if it does go down I'll be glad I did\u2014and will probably buy back in. The thing to ask your self, as always with bitcoin (and investing generally), is what kind of risk tolerance do you have. So far this year, Bitcoin has been impervious to all negative press, forks (Bitcoin Cash, Gold, whatever), etc., and I think the futures will be much the same\u2014little to no effect. That said, hedging your bets is usually a smart idea... ",

I'm paying ~$500/month for the next 5 years, and make just under $4k a month with not a lot of expenses. \n\nI wouldn't rush into it though, again depends on your situation and I'd really get familiar with the idea of Bitcoin, decentralized currency in general and the underlying technology (Blockchain/cryptography etc) first. If you perceive it as something that might work out in the future, and your situation allows for it, then I'd say yeah go for that 5k loan!

They post they want to buy these items and offer their Bitcoin price - anywhere between 10-50% premium I've seen. Then the 'earner' buys the item on their personal Amazon account, and ships it to the buyer's address (shielded by Amazon as its a gift purchase). \n\nedit: I did this the other day, bought ~$40 of items for someone and would earn like ~$35 worth of BTC, now worth about $55.

I'm sorry to hear that it could go so far as to affect your health. I used to think that I'd take my gains when they'd pay for an apartment. Then I thought that I'd take half my gains when they'd pay for an apartment and leave the other half in bitcoin. I looked at boats yesterday for the first time. Right now, I'd take half my gains if they paid for a house in France (where I live) and a studio apartment in New York City. My dreams grow with the price, but I don't believe in them so much that it would destroy me if I had to abandon them. I'm just having fun on the rollercoaster and if I'm very lucky, my dreams will come true. Bitcoin is a great thing regardless of its price.",

The price has stayed the same since 2013. That's great for a crypto - because it's not a shitcoin (fundamentals make sense and they're not trying to scam anybody), hashrate and volume is still high, but it doesn't have the same dev support and supply limitation that Bitcoin has. Doge will never be a HODL to increase your value coin, but if you're looking to park your cryptos into something stable that won't crash to zero, and can be moved around with low fees and relative ease, then it's a pretty good option. Network isn't clogged by kittens either.",

Depending on how much you own, the transaction fee might be inconsequential enough to do it anyway, but if you wait a bit, transaction should be much less congested, and thus cheaper/faster. It's not a good idea to store coins long-term in coinbase/GDAX or any online wallet because you don't have complete control over them and if something happens, however unlikely, like GDAX getting hacked, you'd lose your bitcoins. Your USD is insured on Coinbase/GDAX, but not your bitcoins.\n\nGranted, Coinbase probably has better security than the average person's home computer, so either transfer to a paper or hardware wallet, especially if you have a significant amount.",

You can link a credit card, and instantly buy, I think, up to $100. There's also an identity verification process that may or not be backed up right now due to all the new people interested. It's also Friday, so that can make things slower for bank transfers.\n\nIf you buy bitcoins with an ACH transfer, you \"lock in\" the price you bought them at, but you dont have control over the bitcoins until the transaction clears. So you could buy $2000 worth and sit there for a week watching the price change and you can't do anything about it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, if you're new to bitcoin, you force yourself to not panic sell the moment it drops below what you paid. And realistically, you shouldn't be planning on trading them after buying them unless you're experienced with investing and are utilizing bots.",

            "Text": "Traders on the futures market do not actually buy/sell with actual Bitcoin. It is a cash-settled market. This allows for people to essentially bet against Bitcoin in a way that wasn't possible before. \n\nMany people are speculating whales are buying up BTC right now, driving up the price, only to sell at the peak and bet that the price will go down on the futures market. A big sell off would move the actual BTC price down and massive shorts on the futures market could possibly drive the price down as well. So essentially whales win twice. Rinse and repeat. Technically this is illegal (to trade on futures as well as trading the asset), but with BTC it would be really hard to track this type of shady dealing.\n\nAlthough this is a very possible scenario, I have faith in the fact that this is a GLOBAL movement and all that there are many people just waiting to buy the dip.",

            "Text": "Sure, so if you're using Coinbase and using a bank account to purchase it will take approx. 8 days for the coin to show in your account. You cannot sell until it shows up in your account, so if the price crashes during this time Coinbase is your bro by giving you a forced HODL.\n\nIf you purchase with USD that is in your account then the coin is in your wallet almost instantly.\n\nTo sell a coin, just go to your accounts, specific wallet, and click sell. Once you sell, Coinbase will take a fee, and the USD amount will show up in your USD wallet. You can withdraw it from here or leave it in there to purchase more.\n\nI recommend using GDAX as opposed to Coinbase. GDAX is owned by Coinbase but is like Coinbase's bigger brother. More professional interface, lesser fees, and more options. Give it a look, you can login using your Coinbase credentials. Overall both are easy to use, but I use GDAX to buy and then transfer to other exchanges for trading.",

Whenever I think of buying something or eating out, I just think that the money would be more useful invested, so I've pretty much eliminated fast food from my diet. Over the past month and a half, I've only put in about 800 and have almost doubled it because of putting it in whenever I can. And don't even worry about the fees, you'll lose more if you wait the four business days for money to transfer into Gdax. The main thing is to just research the technology and the implications of a decentralized and global currency. I'll gladly give my money to support that. ",

Just because a new project is stealing share does not mean it is \"dead,\" if anything it means it is doing it better. But remember, the majority of people are in this not for technology, but for investments/profits. So it makes sense that a new project can gain shares as projections rise because they are doing it not because of a project's success but of the price forecasts. Just because a project has backing does not mean shit, how many projects with billions in funding have failed? (hint: alot)\n\nDown 80% relative to bitcoin? No shite. Almost all of them are down relative to bitcoin, that's how these markets work. It's not indicative of projects dying or anything similar, it's just people pulling their money looking for quick profits.\n\nYou don't honestly believe that alts are \"redundant,\" \"dead,\" and unworthy of supporting; do you?",

Whether they will fall obsolete to sidechains, that is yet to be determined, but I am excited to move forward regardless.",
