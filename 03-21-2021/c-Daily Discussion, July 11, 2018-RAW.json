It has been a long 6 months.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShort term predictions from prominent  leaders in the field are not panning out so far this year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have no doubt that bitcoin will succeed in due time, but unless something changes soon, I fear we are in for a long haul ahead. Perhaps similar to the crawl up after the 2014 bear market.  It's starting to feel like that anyway.  Maybe my nausea is a sign that the market will turn around soon.  If not, I don't expect to see a major bull run until we see institutional investment jump on board, or worse, by the halvening in 2020.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy prediction of $100,000 bitcoin within 3 years (early 2021) still stands, it's just not going to happen overnight in my opinion.

The recent short-term bullish bias has been neutralized following BTC's close below (as per UTC) the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday.\n\nFurther, the risk of a deeper pullback to $6,000 (February low and psychological support) look to have increased after Tuesday's 5.7 percent price drop.\n\nHowever, that does not necessarily mean the bears are back in a commanding position, since the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24).\n\nNotably, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern) soon if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days.\n\nAt press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,350 on Bitfinex \u2013 down 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.\n\nView\n\nBTC's close below 10-day MA yesterday has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.\n\nThe immediate support at $6,000 could be put to test in the next day or two, but the probability of a break below that level is low.\n\nA high volume rebound from $6,000 would help BTC chart an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern.\n\nA daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 would boost the odds of a drop below $5,755 (June 24 low).",

Labeling your comments as 'hopium' is all the disclaimer you need, and its exactly what I need sometimes. I decided a while back that 2020/21 was my time horizon, I wanted as much wealth as (responsibly) possible in BTC by then, and I'm committed to it. I knew it would:\n\nA) be a very difficult road if BTC went up steadily, and in DEC it looked like I'd barely reach 1 coin ever. \n\nB) be a very difficult road if BTC dropped hard/stayed super volitile. I'm no trader.\n\nC) be very 'difficult' if BTC skyrocketted before I was ready. Like if I could pay off my house with crypto in 2019, 25 years early, I don't know if I could pass up that opportunity. \n\nYour hopium makes all three of these scenarios more bearable since I won't be changing my strategy no matter what. It's like anesthesia during surgery. Keep it up, please. ",

Thank you for the kind words. \n\nThe only thing that has changed in my mindset is that I think we have a much longer haul to the next legitimate bull run.   I\u2019m impatient because I have probably over invested, because I thought the next bull run might start this summer.   I was misled by others in the media I felt had some credibility and succumbed to fomo. \n\nAnyway season one of Daily Hopium has completed as of yesterday.   Giving it a rest for a while.  It will be back.  I have not lost hope but trying to be realistic on expectations.  The 2014 bear market lasted years before it mooned.  We could face that again now.  I see many parallels, as I have illustrated in my posts. \n\nIn some ways this is a blessing because I was lamenting that I missed the boat on bitcoin.  Now I might have plenty of time to dollar cost average my way to financial freedom someday.  Yay, I guess. ",

We need to redefine how we measure value when it comes to bitcoin because it's a new entity. But one things is for damn sure - Still claiming it has no value is far more ignorant than buying it.  \nAs a system of accounting with it's defined scarcity and mathematical attributes, bitcoin has massive potential. This is a VERY early stage to evaluate it though, because with technology growth, we rarely consider the innovative solutions that we haven't thought of yet. In Bitcoin's case this involves user friendly entry points, wallet address translation, layers for scaling and much more.",

Similar to the dot com era, many companies associated themselves with blockchain to get a quick value lift to lose it again later since the value was based on technology that was not actually implemented.\n\nBitcoin however, is more or less, money. Nothing carries more weight than money and Bitcoin's potential to be a reliable accounting system, currency, store of value is exceptional. It simply needs a few years like all tech for the value to be realized by the masses. The ironic thing here? It's that those who work in finances rarely embrace creativity and imagination... this is a statistical personality trait of most accountants. So it is actually those who work with 'money' and finances that are the last to envision what Bitcoin actually brings to the table.",

The first stock to explode during the Internet bubble was Netscape.   People thought,  you really need a browser to use the internet,  so this new company that is IPOing now sells a browser (and a server but no one cared),  so this must be the hot new technology.   That started the Internet bubble.\n\nHardware stock,  Sun Micro,  Cisco etc.  started bubbling about 6 months later.   Then came the Amazon and eBay IPOs in pretty rapid succession.  When they took off is when the nonsense internet business started,  WebVan.com being my favorite disaster (5 billion raised in an IPO,  evaporated in 18 months).  Pets.com was a favorite because they had a great mascot and good commercials.  \n\nThere was never any real examples of people putting 'dot com' at the end of their business name and it doing anything,  just really stupid ideas for businesses built completely around a 'website'.
