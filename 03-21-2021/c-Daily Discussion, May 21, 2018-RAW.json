There are, and will be more, better alternatives.\n\nUsing Bitcoin at the cost of significantly higher fees, much slower confirmation times, the enormous amount of wasted energy to achieve 3-7 transactions per second and the increased inconvenience of managing your own keys, isn't enough to convince me or really most people that it will be used for mass adoption. I know all the counter-arguments of \"lightning will fix this\", \"but freedom\" and \"all the energy used would otherwise be wasted\", but I'm not convinced.\n\nKindly feel free to try and change my mind, but at this point it's far easier to argue against BTC than it is to argue for the benefits of it in its current state.",
