All you can really do is shake your head and laugh. G forbid they actually make a correct prediction by happenstance. Then they'll have to create a 10-step crypto price predicting guide that they will want to sell you for $10.99!! It's like calm the HELL down; puff...puff...pass would you please!!! We don't even know what to call them to be quite honest. Are the currencies, digital assets, commodities, etc. The truth of the matter is that this blockchain evolution is in its infancy. The crypto markets are, at the moment, swarmed with your average retail investor, most of whom are pump-n-dump day-traders taking advantage of immediate gains. IMHO, we will not be able to obtain accurate price predictions for any crypto until we get mainstream adoption via your institutional investors (i.e. hedge funds, corporations, FIs, central banks, etc.) on board. However, these institutional investors won't enter until the markets mature via more common sense regulatory oversight/compliance and institutional-grade hedging/custody instruments are in place to help mitigate and offset the volatility brought on by the vicious cycles of constant day-trading. Until we get this volatility under control estimating prices is a moot action. The best predictions we can possibly make before the aforementioned occurs is by doing our due-diligence when it comes to our crypto investments by asking a few simple questions:  \n\n1. Is it solving a problem or have a realistically defined use-case?\n2. Can it deliver on solving that \"problem\" or \"use-case\"?\n3. Can it solve such-said problem better, faster, more economical, than what currently exists? \n4. What is the competition doing?\n5. Is anybody actually using/trialing such-said blockchain tech?\n6. Who's behind the tech (i.e. leadership, engineers, institutional players, etc.).\n7. Does the leadership have a \"defined\" vision for their respective blockchain technology?\n8. Is the leadership transparent and above-board (i.e. providing communication, progress reports, etc.)?\n9. Is such-said crypto company/foundation abiding by or working with the regulatory community to ensure a smooth transition (by far one of the most important question)? \n10. Would I be okay if I were to lose my investment despite the best efforts of such-said crypto company/foundation?\n",

SegWit is a big step for Bitcoin's development, everyone's been waiting for it since years ago and it's finally here. \n\nThese are good news for Bitcoin as a blockchain in general, since we know that the biggest problem Bitcoin has it's the fees and slow confirmation times. That's why I think this is a big step forward.",

He has been making some pretty bold claims:\n\n\u201c26 hours 30 minutes before Wall Str start their Bitcoin sell-off. First it will start in Hong Kong, then USA. It will be over a period of 8 hours - start time will be 2018-02-24 01:30:00:00 UTC Time. False UP \u201cspike\u201d could happen be aware not to enter buys [not financial advice]\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know how to explain this better guys, but current Bitcoin break out is a false one - the drop is still coming and going into the end of this month and into first week of March Bitcoin will be at a LOW. Final LOW is expected on Friday the second of March 2018 - $7630/7830\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t named him because I\u2019m not sure if it is breaking Reddit rules and I don\u2019t want to be promoting him. Also he has a number of people replying to him who are almost zealotry in their deference to his supposed genius that they all stink of fake accounts. \n\nHowever in light of the Bitcoin price, roughly, stagnant around $10000 for the last 24 hours I\u2019m just wondering if the explanation about a Wall Street sell-off makes any sense or is total BS?

Maybe it is manipulation, but one thing is also clear to me: there's not enough demand for bitcoin at the moment. Simple fact. To get back at 20.000, you need the same hype as in december: normal people stepping in, everyone talking about bitcoin. Secondly, the people that were holding must stay in.\n\nThis will not happen, this even might not happen this whole year, cause mainstream society got burnt so hard in december, they might never come back. And you need them, you need the mainstream now to lift up the price. We've come to a point that you need the normal guys to step in, cause bitcoin needs constant inflow of new money to rise. The market will bleed to death if there aren't enough newcomers. But it's way easier to bring in new people and raise the price when only 10 people put money in than when millions of people put money in. Also, the chance that 10 people will hold is way higher than a million people holding. So right now, the cryptomarket seems to be bleeding to death. Unless something drastically happens, we're doomed.  \n",

If we do, though, I have 8500 pegged for a potential low. I've had that marked on my chart for a while now because it's the range we hovered around in after jumping out of the 5900 dive (and before we had that little bull run to over 11k). It's also a point where the 50 and 200 EMA crossed (on the 1 hour chart), which is apparently significant, but I don't know enough about that stuff to know why.",

Also, check short positions vs btc price (like this for example: https://mobile.twitter.com/Crypto_Ed_NL/status/966254511089246209/photo/1) but keep being delusional. \n\nAlso your whole point about the volume is wrong. Look what happens if 2k btc (=20mio) gets dumped at once lol. And that is just 10% of the daily volume. Calling 200 mio per day insignificant lol. Also, you just state (which I agree with) that we don't know anything about the actual worth of btc. What do you think happens when the majority of that volume gets dumped, insignificant\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nMy point was that futures would decrease volatility and it absolutely didn't. Also I didn't say 20k was a 'right' or correct price. Just talking about - pay attention now - volatility. No real inherent value + unregulated market > btc and crypto in general will be Wall Streets bitch. Accumulate slowly, dump all at once. Rinse repeat. Close future contracts as a fat added bonus. He was dead wrong. But he was on either the CbOE or CME advisory board so he is either playing people like you or insanely stupid. \n\nSo please do read my comment next time a bit more careful and educate yourself a bit before stating people are wrong.",

            "Text": "Actually - you are somewhat right and I did get a bit confused there. 20000 volume has been going on only for a few days if I remember correctly, before that futures volume was truly insignificant. Anyhow, you can check that yourself. There's been quite a lot of talk about it on r/BitcoinMarkets.\n\nProfessional traders benefitting is another story completely and totally true - I mean, that's their job? But blaming bitcoin's fall as their fault is simply not true. They might earn from it, they might accelerate a fall or rise here and there, but I don't think they'd  have the power to single handedly bring it down from 20000usd to 6000. That's just market sentiment, and I totally agree with it. Bitcoin has yet to prove itself as something  truly useful and groundbreaking.\n\nAnyhow I'll try to be back with more facts once I have not had a few gin and tonics. Cheers. ",

            "Text": "It is and I agree! However, the futures are still leveraged and simply pointing to the volume of the futures by itself is not enough. The assets you summed up have more inherent value than btc for example. What is a single btc worth? 100 usd, 100k usd? No one knows really. \n\nAnd think further than that. Hsbc laundering money for drugs cartels some time ago. I mean, how is that accountable to stockholders? But it happened. Subprime mortgages packages during the housing crisis. If there is money to be made, especially with crypto which is unregulated and a lot of coins/tokens lack inherent value, you can bet institutional money is on it \n\nCheck this out: https://mobile.twitter.com/Crypto_Ed_NL/status/966254511089246209/photo/1\n\nI can give you 20 more of those showing a correlation between future positions and the btc/usd price. A few days ago 400 mio usd(!) got pumped into btc. Thats no regular joe like you or me or a whale in the traditional sense. All institutional money buddy. And yes, huge funds like pensionfunds won't enter btc/crypto. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen at all. \n\nWe're all getting played and futures provided a huge bonus on top of that. No offense but you should be seeing that. \n\nOh and futures do not trade in the weekends but that's kinda irrelevant to my point. Please look up the expiration dates of the contracts and the btc/usd price. It plays a major role and if I had a fraction of those funds available to me i'd play this market as well.",

            "Text": "I would say we agree on most points and got nothing to add to this post really. 20k was the result of massive FOMO/bullrun. Not blaming the professional traders at all or whatsoever, I'd do the same in their position. \n\nThe whole market being in a slump is the result of multiple factors tbh. Bitcoin lacks an inherent value - unlike stocks for example - but it's a real shame futures combined with some big players and even bots are dictating this market so much right now. Again, totally get them; we're all in this for the money in the end.\n\nJust tried pointing out that, while futures tend to somewhat stabilize 'traditional' markets, it isn't the case with crypto. Some were quite wrong with this sentiment and it was kind of foreseeable. \n\nAnyway enjoy your night/g&t's and have a good one:)",

Net exposure and delta are adjusted this way.
