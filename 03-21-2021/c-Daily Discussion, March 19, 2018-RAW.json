They might hold the bitcoins too actually; they weren't using any service that auto converted to fiat, instead converted the THB amount to BTC then got me to send that to their wallet directly. The process needs to be a bit more efficient, but I'm glad to support the system and any merchants who come on board. I think adoption and daily use is the key for long term success.",

But checking out historic prices on tradingview is showing some time in march/april each year theres a fall in price, so maybe there is some theory to people cashing out for their tax. This year, maybe the fall has already occurred (in case anyone didn't notice). \n\nHowever I can tell you this, if the price dives again at month end, I'm buying in, because in may/june of 2016 and 2017 the price started climbing. We all know how the moonshot went last year, maybe it'll do so again :)\n\n",

Their bots or traders put money into all or most of these coins at once, creating an illusion of a bull market return. For all of these coins/tokens to go up on so many tokens, in unison, and then go back down in unison, is pretty obvious what's happening.\n\nYes, the market is driven on news and emotion, but look closer - these patterns of up and down prices on coinmarketcap.com and Coinbase are following each other too tightly to be just news driven. \n\nPlus, there are 'Pump and dump' groups pumping a lot of coins, then dumping for profit.

            "Text": "More Doom and Gloom from me!\n\nToday, there is a story about Cambridge Analytica, a company who essentially wrote a bot to mine information and then created an algorithm to determine a profile based on your personal information, and target information to you that would lead you down a rabbit hole of dis-information in an attempt to change your beliefs or narrative.\n\nWhy this is a big deal, is because Facebook, and Google, and the Advertising community do this on a daily basis from your browser history, and from your Facebook information. They charge for this, and this is what they sell on a day to day business.\n\nSo really, this scandal is really about 'Who is in Control\". Facebook is being quiet because they do the exact same thing for their advertisers, and must maintain control, and the fact that a third party did it, means that it can't happen again. \n\nNow, how does this apply to BitCoin?\n\nGovernments around the globe must remain in control. They have to have control over currency, money, and banks. Bitcoin was an attempt to come up with a global unregulated, un-corruptible currency. Banks, and their Governments, don't want this. They want the ability to own everything, and control everything.\n\nNote how one Bitcoiner went to jail, and not a single banker has gone to jail. Why? Control and power.\n\nGoogle, and many banks and credit institutions, are waging a secret war on Bitcoin, because it's a threat to banks, and moreso a threat to governments. \n\nSo, what do we expect to happen?\n\n1. Something bad will happen, and somehow the American Media will say that Bitcoin payments funded it over the 10K limit, (a banking regulation) so they can link Bitcoin to Terrorism. \n\n2. Political leaders, pressured by the banks, will come out with heavy regulation on Crypto Currencies.\n\n3. Laws will be created where only 'Recognized, permitted banks' will be allowed to trade, buy, and sell crypto, and all financial transactions must be handled by a regulated banking institution, like BOA, Chase, HSBC'.\n\n4. A false crash will happen to scare everyone off. It will be designed to hurt the reputation of Crypto, and to get everyone to move their money out of it, so banks can frame it as a 'bad thing that supports terrorism'.\n\n\nIt will be very important that as people we band together and stop our political leaders from over regulation from the banks. It's going to be a dark time ahead for crypto indeed.",

But most starting and finishing in hours, or at least by day's end.\n\nThe last drop has a pretty standard V-bottom, followed by a good volume rise, followed by another rise.\n\nIs it a pump?  With each passing hour/day, it looks more and more convincing it is not.  Could it be a short (2-4 day) rally, which will be followed by a continuation down?  Probably, but who really knows.\n\nI am torn.  I both want it to drop a little more, in hopes of buying more.  I also want it to rise (so I don't regret purchases I have already made).  My buys have placed me right in the middle of this uncertainty.",

Of course there are people who argue.\n\nLook into DPoS. That's a pretty interesting way of doing PoS. You incentivise the miners to not attack the network by giving the stakeholders the ability to \"vote them out of office\". Interesting to say the least. I don't know if it is as solid as PoW, but I think it's better than straight PoS.\n\nIn the end, markets don't care what's good for the environment. So if we want an environmentally friendly solution we will have to build one that is better than Bitcoin. I think we can do that.",

The gains are small, and the exchange sometimes crashes, forcing the bot to auto-purge inventory at a loss to reduce risk.\n\nAlso, I don't think it'd work on Gday, because the spreads are razor-thin most of the time.",

            "Text": "Profit is already taxed. \n\nWhat can be done is regulate/ban exchanges. If they make it extremity hard/near impossible to convert BTC into dollars then that's very bad. If it was deemed illegal to operate an exchange - that would be the death knell just about.\n\nI don't think the government will ever ban Bitcoin or crypto but make no mistake they could do severe damage if they chose to. \n\nI've heard talk of decentralized exchanges but I have no idea how those could reliably serve as a replacement for what's out there now.

Any dummy can download the free open source code and create a Bitcon clone. Bitcon is continuously being inflated by the miners. They are creating new Bitcons as you speak. When the limit is reached and the miners are not subsidized with newly created Bitcons, you can look forward to a HUGE transaction fee. They aren't going to waste a huge amount of electricity to mine for a tiny fee without getting free Bitcons.\n\n> Do please tell us how you make a billion dollar crypto instantly. \n\nJust look at the 1500+ created cryptos. A lot of them have Billion dollar market cap and hundreds of million market cap. \n\nWhy do you think there are so many ICOs?\n\nIt is because cryptos are so easily created.\n\nAll the cryptos are loony bin crazy overvalued when they are so easily created.",

Whales don't need to spread FUD to tank Bitcoin. If it's not Spoofy, it's some institutional whale pumping Bitcoin up and tempting people into FOMO'ing before it dumps again.  \n\nAs for those forecasting another dump--some people have just been forecasting a possible double bottom. For all we know, it could indeed crash back down. We've had *several* pumps across the board that preceded massive dumps. That's just the way the cookie crumbles.    \n\nI don't think it's wise to get too emotional about the price. This is a bear market pure and simple. As much as we'd all hope for Bitcoin's rise, it's still very much possible it could fall. It's that simple. Don't call them assholes, just be mindful that shit happens in cryptos. Enjoy the volatility during the good times and accept the bears as well.",

            "Text": "It would be free, no Bitcoin needed to search!\n\n*How is search result quality maintained?*\n\nThe idea is that you search on some keywords, but you can actually upvote or downvote the result like on reddit. The vote tally would define how much the site owner would need to pay per page view to keep their position. If something is voted very high and is very popular already, it would be super cheap (or sometimes just free) to keep that position because of how useful it is to people.\n\nOn the other hand, if something is voted low, the site owner would have to pay out more Bitcoin to keep their position. This pushes bad sites lower down the search results.\n\n*What about bots and fake votes?*\n\nAlong with fraud detection based on suspicious activity (same IP, same time period, unnatural clicks) the system can also have proof-of-stake weighting on votes. As a logged-in user (which isn't required either), you can prove that you own some large number of Bitcoin, and as long as the coins don't move, your votes can count a \"little\" bit more in terms of being less suspicious. It's not perfect, but it's basically harder/expensive for a fraudster to buy up a lot of Bitcoin just to fake a lot of votes. And it doesn't cost the user anything, since they are just signing the fact that they own coins. They don't pay a thing.\n\n*How will this site go from empty to full of good search results?*\n\nPeople who submit links will earn Bitcoin on valid upvotes! The rate at which you can submit more links is based on how many upvotes your past submissions received. So, you can't just spam crap into the system. You will earn a higher rate overall per upvote if you have a strong past history of high upvote content, and a lower rate for a low past history. And your posting account is terminated if you have a lot of negative marks/reports (illegal links, duplicate links, affiliate tagged links, etc).\n\nThere is also a caveat that if a site owner _claims_ a domain, the submitter can no longer earn money on votes to any links under that domain.\n\n*How much will I get paid for submitting links?*\n\nLots of Bitcoin. Just kidding! It all depends on how much growth the site gets. In the beginning, expect to get paid a really sweet amount. Once the site is heavily bootstrapped, though, expect to be paid less over time. And don't try to defraud the system by asking your friends to upvote your links. Fake clicks will be detected and you'll lose what you earned.",

Stuff like this is why Google has denied ANY block chain currency advertising and payments, because the banks don't support competition. Facebook joined today, in that they are not going to accept bitcoin as payments. \n\nThe real reason for this is because the banks rule the world. The faster people realize that 'freedom' is not going to happen. \n\nIn order for it to be adopted and used across the board, it has to be owned by the banks or governments, and thus be able to be manipulated. As it's something owned by the people, it's destined to fail because it puts power back in the hands of the people. \n\nThe news keeps bashing it until it's heavily regulated. Once it's heavily regulated, then suddenly Google will 'love Bitcoin'. \n\nOnce a power transfer happens, then it will be adopted globally. Until then, news organizations and Facebook and Google will continue to refuse to accept it because of the amount of fraud they have gotten.",

Houses, aside from being crucial assets for most people, are primarily a way for weaker economic agents to establish useful credit in order to be able to invest. Yes banks get rich off this and predatory lending is a thing, but just doing away with this one kind of thing and leaving the rest of the economic world as we understand it will most immediately hurt all the people who don't already have a lot of capital.
