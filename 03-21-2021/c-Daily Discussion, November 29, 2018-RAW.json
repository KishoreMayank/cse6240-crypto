It means the hype value of the asset is way, way higher than its actual value. ALL markets work the same, there is no exception, cause human psychology and emotion is always the same.  The ONLY bullrun that counts is the bullrun leading to average joe stepping in, the only real bearrun is this bearrun. I don't care what people say about previous bearruns and bullruns. They don't count anymore. So if you had the patience to hold between 2013 and 2015, you will need to have three times as much patience now.  The price of btc will only exceed the ath of december 2017 if, and only if, the coin proves to be valuable (that means adoption, that means blockchain being implenented all over countries and companies, that means people using it to buy stuff). This can take a very very long time, but trust me when I say btc will never reach ath again only based on hype. It has to prove its value, otherwise it's game over.",

            "Text": "I have mixed thoughts on the article. First of all and most importantly, **\u201dSmart money (and increasingly, just more money), will flock to unlevered assets that have limited supply \u2013 gold, bitcoin, or other alternative assets,\u201d** that was all true and fine until hard forks were developed implying that you can buy several equivalents of Bitcoin  (or enhancements since BCash  boosts an 8MB blocksize). So, I am not sold on this notion that Bitcoin has a limited supply; that sounds contradictory. You can identify gold having a limited supply since you can\u2019t hard fork gold (unless they find a way to clone gold in a lab). Secondly, though a mostly well-written article, to a grammar police like myself, that line is dangerously irritating: **\u201cIf you have something that can potentially 50x\u201d**, WHERE THE HELL IS THE VERB? I need a verb. Calling out any verbs. Maybe, if you have something that potentially profit 50x or can potentially give you a 50x return...funny because I was stating 50x Bitcoin return a few days ago and I got chewed up by everyone except you cryptogrip...\n\nI like the very pragmatic theory about how Bitcoin could emerge into mass adoption: trillion-dollar US deficit, underfunded pension funds, and student debt has snowballed to $1.5+ trillion in the U.S... Also, there\u2019s really high credit card debt (medical bills etc), high foreclosure, wages not growing with inflation, pretty much all the ingredients that could devalue fiat currency like USD the same way the Venezuela Bolivar failed.  \n\nBut where I wholeheartedly disagree with this article:\n**Bitcoin is an asset that is non-correlated (volatile yes, but volatility that is unrelated to fiat investments)** Fiat currency is a measure of Bitcoin volatility so of course fiat investments are related to Bitcoin volatility. Fiat investments assuming she means money market funds, CDs or savings account (and not stocks, bonds or commodities) have a relation to Bitcoin volatility.\n\nOverall, good article Cryptogrip and I think some of the stuff she said here could be prophetic.",

            "Text": "Of course! After years of hearing both sides of the equation on Bitcoin, I can say with confidence that the average person who supports bitcoin (not the person who FOMO'd in for a few days last year), is of a higher intellect than the average person who does not. Most people who criticize Bitcoin have very little technical knowledge, and are not technically confident. They tend to say it has no intrinsic value because their perspective of finances is traditional and complacent. They are NOT open to change, and that's a mistake in today's world. The average person who is pro bitcoin seems far more in tune with the value of this new digital way of storing and exchanging value, because they take the time to learn about its potential before regurgitating the 'tulips' insults.\n\nNow before anyone starts accusing me of stereotyping without justification, I repeat ..\"most\" people. It's clear in the typical arguments we hear against Bitcoin that \"most\" people make, that they haven't really taken a lot of time to explore its potential.",

The flat fee for $100 buy is $2.99, the sliding fee for ACH is FREE, so you pay $2.99 in fees. \n\nThis means your $100 is now $97.01 to buy at $5025 which means for $100 you would receive 0.01930547 BTC. Seems you cannot know the withdrawal fee (in BTC) until you withdraw as it is based on network congestion?\n\nThis all looks shady as fuck and designed to fleece people that dont want to crunch the numbers. \n\nUse Coinbase Pro (if you HAVE to use coinbase) and use maker orders where you place an order under the lowest sell order on the books and wait for someone to sell to you (or vice versa). This is a maker order and has no fee. Deposit and withdraw USD via ACH and there is no fee, withdraw BTC is fee free.\n\nhttps://support.pro.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2945310-fees\n\n",

            "Text": "I have been studying the Google trends chart. This log chart is particularly helpful as this is the only way to see the whole picture instead of one huge spike. \n\nhttps://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/google_trends-btc.html#log\n\nNow as I have often mentioned earlier, one has to be very careful interpreting the relationship between price and search trends because they feed on each other. That said, one uncanny takeaway I see is that the price at various bear market bottoms for Bitcoin has been proportional to the square of the search index prevailing at that time. Search index on the link above is defined as the search multiple from 1/1/2012. \n\nSo if you look at the boring lows of 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015 and even late 2016, you will see that price has been very closely proportional to the square of the search index during those periods. But the relationship very quickly breaks down during any period of hype or over bullishness. \n\nMy theory is that this is because at the boring lows, Google trends are indeed a good indicator of how many people are genuinely interested in learning about bitcoin whereas during hype periods, the search index gets contaminated by speculators who are searching bitcoin only because they hear of rising price. \n\nSo now that we are at a boring low, I see a search index of roughly 25 whereas in Oct 2016, it was around 9. So this shows a support for a price of around 700 times (25/9)^2 = 5400. \n\nOfcourse this is assuming that search interest has stabilised and not still contaminated by speculators but I think that's a fair assumption especially after the very dull and low volume markets in October.

Whilst there is a social contract, the issue stems from the fact you can't opt out of this contract, without suffering arrest and imprisonment. \n\nThere's a thought experiment called, \"How many people\" that delves into when the situation transitions from theft into taxation. Whilst I don't fully subscribe to libertarianism, I certainly don't support some of the uses that taxed money is put to, such as war, murder, government bailouts and boomer pensions. Personally I believe the money could be better spent on education, safety, shelter and food. ",

Many of you have attributed Bitcoin\u2019s most recent fall down to $3400 due to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. The Bitcoin community leaders are a joke, both Roger Ver and Craig Wright creating all these hard forks since Bitcoin\u2019s 2017 bull run. Funny how there were virtually NO hard forks in Bitcoin\u2019s dormant years (2014-2016) and suddenly these hard forks spring like hoodrats on a Friday night. **If you really don\u2019t believe Bitcoin Cash and SV don\u2019t dilute Bitcoin, explain the latest fall right when SV was released?** This is the dictatorial cryptocurrency world we live in - decentralized my ass. It\u2019s centralized at the core of losers like Roger Ver and Craig Wright, neither of whom are intelligent or educated enough to make these important decisions. ",

That's typically how technology integrates with society as it becomes improved, more user-friendly, and adopted over time. 10 years is but a drop in the bucket for something like a new concept of currency, which will inevitably take generations to fully implement.",

No wonder that either since most forks of bitcoin are due to small interested parties who cheer lead some egoistic individuals. If this is the genesis of these forks, then it is actually logical that the mining and decision making for these coins is concentrated among few parties too and thus lack any semblance of decentralisation. \n\nNow since blockchain cryptography ensures that these coins can't just be mistaken for real Bitcoin, then where does the concern of dilution come from? For a while, there were concerns that the similar names were what was confusing. But now with the forks fighting amongst themselves and becoming abc and SV, even that falls away as the concern. \n\nI really want to know what you are thinking here.",

Search index on many days of December reached absurd high levels like 200+ and even just under 600 near 8th Dec. But the price did not increase in any proportion as this would suggest. \n\nClick the link I posted above. It shows gtrends data but it expresses the daily gtrend figure as a multiple of what it was on 1/1/2012.\n\nAs for why square, it probably has to do with Metcalfe's law. As more people join a network, the value rises not only in the proportion of increased people but also because each person tends to put in more money due to gaining increased confidence in the value of the network.",

This is not the way a revolution will spread, but it's the way it will start.\nForget about value for a moment and consider the difficulties that you have found the first time you used it. This is the greatest limit in adoption. The scalability comes after, but, as the Bitcoin is tech focused and not user focused, the developers will continue to drive in the wrong direction.\nWhen they will be confident with the technology and will change their focus on GUI and end user, the adoption will starts.\nTill then, accumulating can be a smart decision or a dumb one, but it's only a your decision what way to follow.",

Now for all other dates, they scale down the number as a multiple of searches on 1/1/2012. So today the index of around 25 means that 'Bitcoin ' is searched 25 times more often than on 1/1/2012.\n\nNow my observation is regarding periods of boring bottoms. Here I find that the price at these bottoms has been proportional to the square of the gtrend index. And I have given you the reason why being proportional to the square makes sense. \n\nLook for the price prevailing in mid 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015 and now. It ties up very closely to this proportion. \n\nAnd ofcourse all this data was taken from Google trends.",

            "Text": "How is anything you said \"conclusive\"? Yes, taxes were created by humans, not imposed upon us. At least in the US, we \\*literally\\* revolted from the UK to create a new taxation (and representation) system that was more agreed upon. \n\nFirst, let me summarize John Locke's definition of tactic consent, which was foundational to the DoI and constitution and directly speaks to the issue you bring up. \n\n>Locke stresses individual consent as the mechanism by which political societies are created and individuals join those societies. While there are of course some general obligations and rights that all people have from the law of nature, special obligations come about only when we voluntarily undertake them. Locke clearly states that one can only become a full member of society by an act of express consent (*Two Treatises* 2.122). The literature on Locke\u2019s theory of consent tends to focus on how Locke does or does not successfully answer the following objection: few people have actually consented to their governments so no, or almost no, governments are actually legitimate. This conclusion is problematic since it is clearly contrary to Locke\u2019s intention.  \n>  \n>Locke\u2019s most obvious solution to this problem is his doctrine of tacit consent. Simply by walking along the highways of a country a person gives tacit consent to the government and agrees to obey it while living in its territory.\n\n(this is a brief excerpt. If you'd like to read more: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/))\n\nThe high-level point is that, as long as there is nothing stopping you from doing so, if you don't like the rules of a given society (whether it be taxes, Sharia law, or anything in between), you are free to leave it and find one that suits your needs. If you don't like the rules and don't leave, you are giving your tactic consent to follow the given society's rules. In this case, that means paying taxes.\n\n  \nSecond, what is your alternative to taxation? How do you expect infrastructure to be maintained? Public schools? Food stamps / assistance programs? Medicaid / SS? Public transportation? Education grants/awards/scholarships? Fuckin NASA?\n\nIn your first comment, you said:\n\n> Suppose a case where some shithead takes control of Syria and starts massacring his own population with chem weapons. It would be sweet to raise funds to whack him \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHAT'S LITERALLY WHAT TAXES DO\n\n[https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go)\n\n>**Defense and international security assistance**: Another 16 percent of the budget, or $605 billion, paid for defense and security-related international activities.\u00a0 The bulk of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department.\u00a0 The total also includes the cost of supporting operations in Afghanistan and other related activities, described as Overseas Contingency Operations in the budget, funding for which totaled $74 billion in 2016.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou seem to be saying that if we have \"anonymous money\" then taxes won't be needed, or able to be collected, which is absurd.
