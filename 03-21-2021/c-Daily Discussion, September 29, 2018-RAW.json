No, its main usecase will be that of store of value and to be a crypto asset that is valuable through scarcity. And yes, success is this usecase will also make it the choice of payment mechanism is certain special conditions where finality of payment without needing intermediaries is of high importance. Coffee shops and micro payments are use cases that could be served but far from what is necessary or imminent for bitcoin to succeed.\n\nYou need to think for a few seconds. If you fiat in your pocket or contactless card, what incentives do you have to spend the bitcoin rather than fiat on your coffee? On the other hand, do you have incentives to store wealth in an asset whose supply is absolutely fixed? Also if you are buying property from a seller abroad where a large amount is at stake and you have doubts on finality of transaction, will you be incentivised to receive bitcoin? Think of all these situations independently to see which are core cases and which are fancy ones.\n\nTldr: coffee payments by btc may become widespread but if they do, it will be the last rather than first stage of bitcoin adoption.",
