But if they want to close their withdrawal system and not give it to you, there's nothing you can do about it. This is the same thing banks can do these days with your bank account. In both situations, you can sue them (bank or exchange) but that's a lengthy, expensive and tedious process that will prolong you not having access to your bitcoin.\n\nSo, instead, you just keep your bitcoin in your own private wallet and none of those risks apply to you anymore. When you're ready to sell, you transfer the amount you want to sell to the exchange (which takes 10-30 minutes) and sell it. \n\nThe only people who can't do this are traders, because they want to trade so they need to have some money on the exchange on a constant basis, but all profits can easily be lifted and moved to a private wallet at the end of the day/week.",

Most people serious about accumulating bitcoin are not doing so for a year, they are looking year and years away. As advancements such as bio-metrics like you mentioned happen, so will advancements in the bitcoin network. I've never seen the crypto infrastructure grow as much as it did in this past year, and that's the trend to watch for. It's typically during lull periods in the price that the real growth and building happens. It's still early days and people waiting and watching have set unrealistic expectations. That being said, I would expect the previous ATH to be easily surpassed within the next year or 2, and price will catch up with infrastructure. ",

If suddenly we moved to a bitcoin only economy in the USA, stuff will still go up all the time in price, an artificial raise of prices, when the salaries in bitcoin would not go up, effectively giving you the same situation you have now but with fiat.

Factor in the case that the normal public has no interest in switching,  and you are left with a 'great idea' that really went nowhere.",
