You need to understand the rationale behind the rise many expect and also the risks involved including the fact that right now the crypto market is immature and much like a soap opera. Now is a good time for those who have done their research and willing to stomach potential downside for the next 2 or 3 years. Ofcourse it could happen we are already at a bottom but do not count on this being a certainty.\n\nCome to think of it, this advice would have been apt at any point in the past for bitcoin including last December. But at that point, too many jumped in with no regard to the risks and the result is so many whiners today.",

So now we have 42 million.\n\nMy question is, I've been seeing some talk of \"bch fork.\" Does that mean there is now a Bitcoin 3 bringing additional 21 million coins.\n\nFor a grand total of 63 million bitcoins.",

            "Text": "The thing to understand is that there really are no coins. I think it's better describe them as entries on a ledger, and you can only use those entries as an input to another ledger entry (in other words, you can only send the bitcoin) if you have the private keys for it. These keys are what are in your cold storage wallet.\n\nWhen a chain forks, you can think of it as a copy being made of the ledger, and all the existing entries on the original ledger are also on the new ledger. So, all your private keys will work on both ledgers. But, transactions made on one chain are not present on the other chain.\n\nHowever, if there is no replay protection, it is possible that if you send \"coins\" on one chain, somebody could replay that transaction on the other chain, even if they don't have access to your private keys. So before moving anything around, make sure you understand what's going on and how to protect yourself.",

It makes sense that they are worried about that. just like you might be worried if a long hold stock tanked. Also, the 20T debt is in a large part offset by US GDP growth, which is currently growing faster than the debt. GDP/Debt ratio is more important than debt by itself. In 2017, USAs debt/gdp was 105.4, down from 105.8 in 2016. Compare that to japan, at 225, greece, at 185, Spain at 111.5, and the UK at 103.5. In fact, the average for developed countries is 111, which means that the US has a better than average debt to GDP ratio.",

            "Text": "There are no possible bullish signs. What the hell are you talking about. Why can't people understand that as long as there is ZERO interest in btc, nothing will go up and it only can go DOWN. Now, the question is: is this a problem? Yes, when you want to get rich quickly. But that's not going to happen. We are in a BEARmarket. That means no interest, negative sentiment, correction, people selling their coins, no new investors, insecurity, criticism and cynism. It can take a LONG time before this kind of sentiment goes away. Especially after the .com/cryptobubble. That means speculation period is OVER. Why? Because once average joe steps into the game, like what happened with the .com bubble, the rules of the game change. Average joe steps in, gets burned and steps out. Now you have a problem, you have the big bubble, bursting. Cause average joe will NOT come back. He is not a holder, he never really believed in btc and actually he doesn't give a shit about it. He forgot about it a long time ago. That is why it's going to take a very long time to pass 20k again. The only way to pass this point, is when an asset proves to have VALUE in real life. Its intrinsic value needs to climb in order to match the fake bubble value during hype/mass hysteria. In this case, it means adoption of blockchain. That is when companies are going to see VALUE in things, and when companies see value in a technology, it's a different ballgame. Governments will start to see value in it, and eventually society as a whole. Now, it's not difficult to see the value of .com companies. Crypto? Alot has to change for it to become valuable. There are too much problems that need to be solved. It's going to take time. 2,3,4,5 maybe 6 years. Will btc reach 100k one day? Maybe/probably. But not any tim soon. The ones who have the most patience always win the investment game. ",

You can offer a cheaper, better way to do things, but ALL governments have to like it, all banks have to like it, the mob has to like it, and the billionaires have to like it. The problem is ALL of those people make trillions off of banks, fiat, corruption, collusion, and changing the LIBOR. They are not going to roll over quietly because 'the people' want an alt coin. Governments will not be like 'ok, let's use Bitcoin'. At least not big ones.",

The only person losing here is the owner of the real gold. I'm way too out of the loop of the BTC/BCH bullshit tho, do you see any flaws with my above logic?",

The only thing that counts in business is demand. If there is demand for Fool's gold, then people have spoken, and one should accept it as a reality. You are not ought to be a moral judge when it comes to marketlaws. You should be there were there's demand. Besides, who are you to judge morality? The same thing could be said about btc: it is fake money, no real value, prone to manipulation, etc. Just to say: everyone's perspective on what is moral and honest is different. You are not an investor but a fool.",

Quite reasonably.\n\nSo I'd probably go to irons.com and buy the one that says 'recommended'.\n\nIn the same way that possibly hundreds of thousands of people have gone to Bitcoin.com and bought Bcash.\n\nIt is, in my opinion, unreasonable to expect everyone to be an expert in what they purchase and understand.  \n\nGot to go, Saturday is endangered animal dining night, and cook wants me to approve the panda carcass.",

Most of these folks also would not have entered back even in Dec 2015 when price recovered back to 300 and then 400. These folks probably shut themselves out of the next bull run all the while convinced they were the SMART ones or ended by sheepishly entering at levels 5x of where they once sold off. \n\nThose selling off now are in all likelihood repeating this same picture in a magnified fractal.\n\nIn saying all this, I don't deny the possibility of market taking a step lower before recovering.",

If you don't believe me, let's just do this convo over PM and we can go all into the details of what we were originally talking about. I'm not trying to disparage the sub or troll, I'm moreso disillusioned with where the overall crypto market is headed.\n\nSatoshi's dream is 100% what I support - a completely de-centralized money system in which the source of truth lies in blockchain tech and not any living or elected entity. There are people in 3rd world countries or under oppressive regimes who are in DIRE need of this kind of system. I'm a little cynical in that the 1st world crypto users had no issue bowing down to the big banks to give them crypto ETFs, which in my opinion will never allow mass adoption and cripples any attempt at de-centralization. See what Trump is doing to the markets now with his fake trade rumors? I'm terrified to see crypto go that route, and I feel like it already has. That's all. I'm not anti crypto, I'm just supremely anti bank involvement.",

Remember that most btc holders are cult members, not investors. I'm one of the few owning bitcoin who isn't a cult member. On the other hand: it's good to have these cult members, they won't sell their bitcoin, maybe only when a nuclear world worldwar breaks out. Same goes for other crypto holders. If you understand their mindset, you'll understand why people like Hitler and the nazi-party became so popular. All these Telegram groups and Reddit groups are extremely fanatical. Every dissident is being attacked, every critical opinion is being deleted, people with a critical mindset are being banned. It is 1942 with a modern touch, digital totalitarism. If you understand these groups, you'll understand that it wasn't Hitler's fault, it was the mass. The mass is way more dangerous than a dictator. They want totalitarism, they want to ban different opinions, they accept no opposition. Fortunately, it's only about crypto. Imagine if it was about politics. Oh wait... ",

Way too dangerous imo to let a US bank handle mass adoption for a currency literally trying to bring them down.\n\n2) Bitcoin community has lots of vocal minorities that have no idea what the hell they're talking about. As it is with companies and other organizations, the leaders who took Bitcoin from whitepaper to today might not be the best ones to take us from today to mass adoption. Being a baller engineer doesn't make you a baller economist, even if bitcoin made you rich and you've been working on it since Day 1. If you keep shilling the \"BUT MUH US DOLLAR INFLATION OVER 100 YEARS\" meme, you're going to stop getting respect. Making lots of black and white statements without acknowledging the incredible nuances of the global economy, and then blindly turning away anyone who stands to disagree with you only works if you're the current President of the United States. \n\n3) Securing your bitcoins is still 100x harder than securing my cash. And yeah, it's easy to make statements like \"oh hurr durr your bank could steal your money at any time\". Guess what? I haven't met a SINGLE person in my ENTIRE LIFE who had a bank steal their money in the US. Yet for every one person who posts a downside to banks on here, I feel like I see two posts about someone losing all their bitcoin in a hack. What makes this even worse is that the person whose bank fucked them over gets all this sincere apology and camaraderie, but the person who lost their bitcoin is ridiculed. How can we promote mass adoption if you have to be watching your back all the time to make sure you don't slip up and lose your btc? There's some mysterious future add-on to Bitcoin that will solve this - I have no idea what it is, but without a solution to this problem, mass adoption will never happen imo.\n\nWhat I do like going for Bitcoin, though:\n\n1) It's getting the fuck outta the limelight. Volatility has gone way down, which was something I was originally concerned about for BTC being a future currency.\n\n2) Square, one of my favorite startups of late, seems to be really bullish on Bitcoin and promoting it via the Cash app. Not to disparage the people putting in blood sweat and tears, but it's much more relaxing to see a 30-billion dollar company promote bitcoin than it is to read shill articles on this sub. \n\n3) Bitcoin has been around for ages, but has only been in the public limelight for a year or two. It's bound to attract far more talent today than it did five years ago, which should result in a parabolic curve of new innovations, adoption, and utility. If I start to see signs of this, I think I'll start to feel better. ",

When I did this (a few months back) I literally just plugged in a bunch of bitcoin price points from 2014-2016 into my trusty old TI-86 and came up with the linear model of the form (y-y1)=m(x-x1). Yes I still use this type of calculator. I omitted year 2017 because it was an anomalous hype-driven bubble and didn't represent natural growth unlike the period 2014-2016. The model output a price of ~$4000 by the end of 2018. It basically approximates a doubling in price every year from 2014.  Then I speculated that we must have attained a good number of Hodlers due to the news hype media exposure during the 2017 bull run.  I am just one of those new Holders (continuously accumulating bitcoin).  So I cede your point that there is a lot of uncertainty in that part of my theory, but since we respected the $5.8k price all year until now I thought I wasn't too far off.  I fancy the bitcoin floor kind of like a trampoline. The equilibrium floor point for the last few months has been ~$5.8k -> ~$6k. Since Wednesday we had a hard crash with an unknown cause, so the trampoline floor was pressed down below it's equilibrium range.  If my theory holds, we should see it rise back above equilibrium over the coming weeks.  I would be surprised if we didn't get back above $6k by end of December.",
