Somebody gets a big margin call at that level or gets rekt on some fake paper Bitcoin contract.  Bulls patiently chewing up all the cheap dumped coins, digging in for the next pump.  Those coins borrowed for the big dump back in November haven't been paid back yet.  \n\nWho's ready for the ultimate reverse Bartman formation!  It will confirm at $6300.",

            "Text": "Here's an idea I've been thinking about. It's some type of UTXO economic majority voting thing. It would not require a hard fork to work but instead uses voluntary 0 fee transactions with the fees paid to miners in another unique way.\n\nHere's how it would work generally\n\n-every so often a checkpoint is defined as perhaps the first block every week or month\n\n-at the checkpoint the UTXO is hashed along with the block hash\n\n-software that signals UTXO checkpoints would create transactions with no fees but instead have an output to the address with the private key being the hash described earlier, the amount paid would be the same as what the fee would have been (the hash computation would only have to be done periodically)\n\n-because everyone including the miner can calculate this hash they can sweep all the outputs when they create a block, if a miner doesn't, anyone can sweep it\n\n-each block after the checkpoint would then contain many transactions that pay out to the same output and all appear to be 0 fee transactions\n\n-light wallets would then see what percentage of transactions are voting for that UTXO set by getting all blocks after the checkpoint till the next checkpoint\n\n-if a large enough margin of transactions are paid to special outputs the light wallet can be sure they are on the chain that is being used by the majority\n\n-it would seem attacks would be hard since the attacker would have to have more transactions in the blocks than the economic majority for a long period after the checkpoint\n\n-perhaps spam attacks would be easy to spot as there would be two competing UTXO sets being voted on and the software would wait for more certainty\n\n-software that votes erroneously would be ignored as the hash would be unknown so all those votes would be swept by non miners or only certain miners colluding\n\nIf most transactions were done this way, it would appear light clients could measure how true a UTXO set is likely to be based on measuring transactions contained in the blocks.",
