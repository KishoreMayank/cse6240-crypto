And that according to satoshi everything was supposed  to securely and cheaply work on-chain for every person on the planet  (apart from micropayments in the sub cent range)? Then why exactly is  the block size limit what it is right now?\n2. If  a few billion people would start using exclusively bitcoin as their  money within the next few years, how much would an average person be  spending on LN fees (including opening and closing channels obviously)?  Just asking for a very rough estimate if thats somehow possible.\n3. And  in that case, about how many LN channel opening and closing TXs would  the blockchain have to handle? (7 per second are possible with the  current block size limit and this is not going to change, right?)\n4. And  is it true that the poorest people on earth wont be able to afford this  anymore? Wasnt that one of the most valued aspects of bitcoin before  (morally)? (I know that they can right now because fees are low, but  thats not the case anymore when TX volume goes up like in december  2017.)\n5. Is  the LN \\*significantly\\* more decentalized/secure than the forks with big blocks? If not  and it gets attacked/taken down, could the block size limit instantly be  increased, so that everyone can keep paying his stuff on-chain without  drowning in fees? And how can people be sure that this would happen in  that case?",

            "Text": "All these points have been endlessly discussed. From the way your questions are worded/directed it appears you have been taken in by a deliberate misinformation campaign.\n\n1)The block size limit was introduced by Satoshi; it is a security mechanism that limits spam on the blockchain. There are quite a few benefits to limiting the blocksize; lower orphan rates; lower resource costs to validate the blockchain, etc. Because Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no central authority to make changes. Changing Bitcoin means convincing each and every person in the ecosystem to change. When it comes to money people tend to be conservative regarding consensus breaking changes. Essentially there are good reasons to keep the 1MB blocksize; and even if increasing blocksize was a good thing; it would have to be nearly universally seen as necessary in order for \"Bitcoin\" to increase blocksize.\n\n2) Impossible to know; why would the masses be opening LN channels? The masses will initially purchase BTC via Lightning; they will spend via Lightning. The cost on the LN network will likely be miniscule and will approach the marginal electrical and bandwidth cost of a transaction over time.\n\n3) Impossible to say; why would you assume regular people will want to settle to the blockchain? They will have the ability if they so desire; but most will not want the responsibility of being their own bank. If Bitcoin becomes the defacto global currency I'd estimate less than 0.01% of people will ever be knowledgeable enough to even desire to settle a TX to the blockchain itself.\n\n4) Impossible to know\n\n5) Yes LN is more decentralized than scam coins like bcash, why even ask this question instead of looking at publicly available information regarding miner diversity, node counts,  etc. No blocksize limit cannot be increased easily; nor can the total coin numbers.",

            "Text": "These  are good questions and I can't answer them all in depth, so I'm going to try to keep it simple:\n\n1) There originally was no block size, but spamming the mempool required the implementation of one.\n\n2) Couldn't handle 2B people on-chain.  Sidechains and layer 2 can help.  Also, there are already plenty of custodial services (but that's defeating the point).  LN routing is extremely cheap, but opening/closing channels is expensive.\n\n3)  A lot.  Probably 2-3 per month per person.  7 per second isn't a hard limit.  Native segwit signatures, Schnorr signatures, taproot, transaction batching can all increase the number of on-chain transactions significantly in the future.\n\n4) If it really takes off, none of us will be able to afford on-chain base layer transactions on a regular basis (i.e., maybe for buying a house, etc.).  We'll all be using layer 2 - probably on top of sidechains if it really gains wide adoption.  Block size should be scarce if decentralization is important.\n\n5)Yes, LN is more decentralized by a landslide.  Attacking it would be like attacking the internet - it may slow traffic for some, but you still just route around any outages.  No, you I don't think you could instantly convince 10K node operators to agree to a consensus change and increase the block size limit - it's there for a good reason.\n\nAlso, in general, don't think of solutions to scaling problems in linear terms (like block size increase).  That will never work in the long run - instead we need creative solutions like lightning, which expand traffic exponentially as that's the only mode that will successfully reach a significant scale.",

They invested big in R&D (yes I know their pockets are lined by the Chinese government), and all they are doing is reaping the rewards of their investment.

As for the 5G drama, my uninformed opinion is that a big motive (and funding) for the  upgrade from 4G is to better facilitate government surveillance. So the question is; would you prefer the Chinese government, or the 5 Eyes governments to be watching you. Personally, I prefer the one that is furthest away from me.",
