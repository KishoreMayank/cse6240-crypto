Even the trolls don't come around anymore, calling everyone a bag holder and making snarky remarks. Where have they gone?\n\nMeanwhile the next halving dawns on the horizon. First litecoin, we'll see the impact that'll have. Actually we see it already. Then finally next year, the big B.\n\nOnly silent clever hodlers around now, watching lightning grow and prosper, dca'ing, knowing now is the bullshit free time to accumulate.\n\nWe are living in exciting times wrt bitcoin, even if it doesn't look like it if you focus on price only.",

Again it remained locked tight. \"What I pay you,\" he informed it, \"is in the nature of a gratuity; I don't have to pay you.\"\n\n\"I think otherwise,\" the door said. \"Look in the purchase contract you signed when you bought this conapt.\"\n\n...he found the contract. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip.\n\n\"You discover I'm right,\" the door said. It sounded smug.\"\nFrom Ubik, by Philip K. Dick. \n\n\n\nThinking about a world of streaming money, global currencies and mass adoption has me wondering if we're going to create a society where everything is pay to play and if our idealism today will lead to a horrifying future.  Are cryptocurrencies just a way for corporate superstates to emerge that rule us all or will they truly restore the sovereignty of the masses whose wealth the world runs on?\n\nCrypto has the potential and probably will change the world.  I havent been this excited about a technology since the internet.  But like the internet, that idealism was quickly rolled over by the wheels of progress and commercialization of the technology.  I guess I'm just now starting to realize how this could happen in crypto and how the idea of being freed from the bondage of rich, centralized institutions may end up imprisoning us all by being able to monetize and microcharge for everything we do.",

Let's talk about how that destroys the middle class and stratifies society into the extremely rich and the extremely poor.  That's not freedom.  That's slavery to a corporate superstate where the only people with citizenship rights are those with wealth or those worthy of employment in an increasingly automated world where labor is the next industry to be eliminated in the search for profit.",
