Not for mining but rather allowing smaller pooled miners to receive payouts via lightning without having to hit a specific limit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought a Bitmain R1 on a whim about 1-2 years back and has been running nonstop on PPLNS (cause that lottery just never seemed appealing) and still hasn't hit the minimum obviously. It probably averages 10-20sat a day now, but I was thinking I could get daily (or at least more frequent) payouts if a pool supported lightning and could output that with a millisat fee. Then I was thinking you could route that to slowly top up a lightning node.",

But goddamn, what a mess, he thinks it only exists 3 coins and 2 of them are \"fractions of Bitcoin\", and then he said that he saw yesterday that BTC is $1500 (where?! I'd buy right now lmao). And guess what? With this much knowledge, he said it will throw $500 in this \"company\" which, as far as I understood from this bs, it does the same thing that Bitconnect used to do. I tried to explain a little better how this works and that he doesn't need no \"companies\" to buy crypto, but he thinks it will get rich overnight so whatever. In short, there still A LOT of naive people in this space, it gave me the 2017 vibes all over.",

We have constant steady growth, then one whale tries to keep us down and spikes it low, then we just buy up all their bags and keep marching. It's only a matter of time.\n\nThink of what happens each time they dump like that. They market sell straight down through the buy orderbook, and fill hundreds of peoples bags, decentralizing their fat stack.\n\nWhen the market stays limp afterwards, they can buy back most of it at the low price, and expand their stack. But when the market instantly responds by buying the dip, the person that market sold their stack will lose bigtime. If they want to replace their stack, they are now buying through the sell orderbook, but they are competing against everyone else doing the same thing buying the dip.\n\nSo they may have dumped 1000 BTC to cause the dump, but by the time the price reaches 4k again, they'll only have bought back 800 BTC for the same value they sold at. \n\nIt's getting more and more dangerous to market sell, or short. \n\nThe response to the spikes down over the last 2 weeks have been insanely bullish. All anyone that is market selling is doing right now, is filling the bags of thousands of holders that the new ground floor is built on.",

It is nice seeing a clean steady climb. \n\nI shorted in the 4100 area. I\u2019d feel a lot better if bitcoin could get back to those levels. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one that shorted in the 4000-4200 area. The longer it reject 4000 the more it sells me on a downward correction. ",
