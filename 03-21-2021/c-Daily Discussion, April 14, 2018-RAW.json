The market depth has shifted upwards during the last hour and the drops have been less and less severe. While we might have some sideways action for some time, the period between mid-April towards July has historically been positive, so I personally don't want to miss out on that potential opportunity.\n\nWe still need to probe the 8.2k-9k area, but it's possible that sellers catch up on the positive momentum and decide they might get a better sale price if they wait and sell at a higher price altitude, especially if we don't go below 8k-7.9k anytime soon. Still, the sell pressure over 8.2k is still relatively unknown so smaller dips at that point may happen. But considering the slow, steady climb right now, perhaps the crossing will be less eventful than I had expected.\n\nAt this point it appears to me that the new pricerange at around 8k has been tested and proven to hold, I was a bit skeptical at first after that first initial bullrun climb from sub 7k to 8k. When I zoom out at the 30 minute range, I don't want to end up on the wrong side of that slow trending climb.",

            "Text": "That's a possibility. On the other hand there are also a lot of sellers that have waited weeks to sell at 8.2k-9k, which means that the buying pressure will need to be tested against the selling pressure and regarding this it's a bit early to forecast what happens above the 8.2k range at this point in time. If bitcoin doesn't push past 8.2k within the coming days then there is the possibility that it might revisit the 7.5k-7.8k range.\n\nThe buying pressure has been strong for the last two days since the 'great spike' from $6.8k, however, I trust a slower climb more than a sudden elevator, and while I expected a recovery the coming days and weeks, the acuteness of the angle of that rise was a surprise. As for bullish sentiments the overall confidence levels have increased dramatically; even if the price were to fall a few hundred dollars due to temporary high sell pressure, the price would likely bounce back up relatively soon, or at least stabilize and then trend upwards. I don't see sub 7k prices coming back anytime soon.\n\nLooking at the market depth, there are some trader expectations of purchase orders at 7.5k, which may be in the wishful thinking territory at this point in time, I just wouldn't rule that possibility out completely.",

This mixed with speculation makes people want to be a part of it which in turn drives the price up more. Personally I don't think we think we will ever reach $1 mil coins because that is just too much. But Bitcoin absolutely has the space to grow to $25-100k a coin. ",

All those forms of money that were used by primitive tribes had no intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is not a property that the medium of exchange needs to have. All it needs is 1) to be hard to acquire and hard to inflate, 2) to be easily divisible into smaller units and 3) to be easily carried around across space.",
