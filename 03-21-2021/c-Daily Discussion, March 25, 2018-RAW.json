I am mainly a dip buyer and hodler but I need to add to my stack somehow and waiting for my paychecks is taking too long.  I\u2019m only going to trade a very small portion of my total stack.   I\u2019m hoping this won\u2019t be a total disaster but since I\u2019m only risking a little bit I\u2019m not too worried.  Now watching the price 24/7 has a purpose other than just ocd. \ud83d\ude0e",

There will be no benefit to trading with bitcoin. Originally there was the benefit of no oversight, people funded terrorism and bought drugs. Soon, banking regulations will put a stop to that with tracing everything. \n\nIt's really been the hot fad that is dying out.",

There's a lot of information you need to remember to put on there, most importantly what each transaction is worth in USD, and what the rate was at the time. You also need to remember to have a column for the combined gains or loss of a transaction, and keep a separate note or column of how you got to that sum, and where those gains originate from. You also need to keep track of where the Bitcoin you are using originally were purchased from (as in from what original purchase and date and rate). If you use just $200 worth of Bitcoin to buy some Cardano, out of $1000 worth of Bitcoin you bought 3 months ago, you have to keep track that you have $800 left from that purchase, and know you originally bought the Bitcoin at the rate from 3 months ago, and you have now a new rate. \n\nBut really the important thing is to know what all your transactions were worth in USD.",

            "Text": "I didn't know this was a thing in general (which this sub-discussion makes me believe). But regarding DAX, a coworker who has been trading (stocks, incl. put/call options) for many years told me that the DAX is probably gonna dive a lot more even though it has already. Why?\n\nBecause its moving averages of 200 days and of 50 days have just crossed each other while there already was a downtrend. Supposedly, that means that the likelihood of even more considerable imminent drop is high.\n\nIt seems the same applies to other instruments, too - e.g. the Bitcoin. I didn't know this, and I don't know if it's true at all. But it seems to be a thing in many people's minds.\n\nYou can see screenshots of the possibly imminent cross in other responses to our root comment.",

            "Text": "Well first of all let me say that I think it's great that you did some backtesting on a strategy that you think might work and share your methods and results on here. \n\nJust as a feedback these are the things that I don't like about the backtesting you did and which for me makes the backtesting unreliable:\n\n1. You backtested on a total of 17 data points which for backtesting is far and far to little (should be atleast be in the hundreds and preferable thousands for any reliable results). This alone for me makes the results negligible.\n\n2. The backtesting period you choose to backtest your short strategy is during a clearly overall downward period of the market which would make almost any short strategy come out on top. You should test the strategy during multiple market conditions not just the one that favors your strategy the most (hindsight bias). And also choosing the weekends because you know that bitcoin has dropped the most in the weekends during your backtesting period is clearly creating hindsight bias. And indeed I don't think it's a good idea to see the backtesting period (the screenshots) in full before doing the backtest because ofcourse this could influence your results if you (knowingly of unknowingly) take this data into account.\n\n3. You don't really clearly specify your entry and exit rules. You say your entry point is 'after Bitcoin rises somewhat on saturday and then when you think you found the peak you go short' and then 'when it rises to much you kill the trade'. These really arn't clearly defined entry and exit rules and should be specified much clearer to prevent subjectivity influencing the results to much. For example 'On saturday after the price of bitcoin has risen more then 5% I will go short after it then falls for more then 2% from the top. Then I will exit my short position after it has dropped for more then 5% en then rises more then 2% from the bottem'. \n\n4. You state that the strategy would have worked during the backtesting period because you only got 2 losers and 11 winners. These results alone do not prove that the strategy would have been profitable during that period. You should be looking at how much (in percentages or dollar amount) your winning and losing trades make and then check if your winners outweight the losers and by how much (you can have losing strategy's that have far more winners then losers in it because the risk/reward is not good enough). \n\nThese are just some points that I myself would work on for futher backtesting but in no case am I some backtesting legend myself.\n\n\n\n\n ",

Then price drops and sells are pulled and whale buys all the cheap coins that you just panic dumped. \n\nThis is the intended result.

Haven't found any resources to trade it specifically for cryptocurrencies (but should work the same as any other financial asset).\n\nSo far it's just based on gut-feeling. I prefer to invest in coins that I actually believe in Long-Term (like the 2 mentioned above). But always try to day-trade/swing-trade to accumulate more as well.\n\nI feel like we are close from another bull market. So far the markets are stagnant, so I feel good to trade high/lows.\n\nAlthough it has happened to me that I sold, and then the next day there is a big 50-100 percent move. That really sucks. I guess HODLing in long term could probably be more profitable....\n\nAgain, I am no expert here :)",

            "Text": "The death cross is a metric that describes market behavior. The death cross does not predict market behavior. Once the 200/50 day moving averages cross, one can officially say that the market is in a downturn. However, this does not mean the downturn will continue, get worse, or reverse itself. This is just comparing moving averages. It is not some magic number that says anything about what the market will do. If it has any predictive power at all it\u2019s because idiots use it as a predictor in which case it becomes a self fulfilling destiny.\n\nIn typical stocks that are backed by actual capitol and revenue, it has more meaning as its difficult to reverse a downward trend. So once you know it\u2019s actually in a downturn (i.e. a death cross has occurred) you could expect that it will continue downward. However, bitcoin is entirely different. Prices are driven entirely by speculation which a slight breeze can swing to either extreme in an instant.",

Yes, it's only 17 data points, but it's all data that could be surveyed.\n\n> And also choosing the weekends because you know that bitcoin has dropped the most in the weekends during your backtesting period is clearly creating hindsight bias.\n\nNo, I heard someone say that Bitcoin drops on the weekends, and so I checked if that's a viable strategy to bet on. If that's hindsight bias, then I don't know what's wrong about hindsight bias. I mean, I did see the screenshots in full, but it's 17 of them, the chart movements are complex, and I revealed them only bit by bit when I made the entry/exit points.\n\n> You don't really clearly specify your entry and exit rules.\n\nTrue, partly because it would have been a few paragraphs, and partly because I'm still a beginner whose take on when to enter/exit is still to a high fraction emotion, is not entirely intellectualized decision making.\n\n> because you only got 2 losers and 11 winners.\n\nYep, I know that the actual numbers could still be bad, but priority 1 should be to have a high probability of winning the trades. All other parameters can be adjusted once that goal has been achieved. At least, that worked well for me in my paper trading.",

E.g. when Facebook just dropped a lot due to the data leak thing, I am sure that a lot of that drop was related to expectations regarding *what others will do*, so you'd go along with those expectations, sell, and rebuy once the stock is down, now you made a profit.\n\nAnd in the Facebook example, that needn't mean that the company is actually worth less than before - at least not by that amount. A lot of that drop could just be mutual speculation for the sake of making a dime.\n\nAbusing the death cross as a predictive indicator could be just the same.\n\nAlso: While the Bitcoin death cross is not a certainty, I mean, it may just be a grazing shot of the two indicators (maybe with a bit of crossover, but no real deep cross), other death crosses may be more massive, *and you can therefore see them coming with some certainty in advance, and there's your predictive power.* So I think as a beginner trader.

But hindsight bias happens when instead of first formulating an hypothesis like 'I believe bitcoin tends to fall in the weekend because (fill in some reason/I myself really can't think of one)' and then start backtesting this hypothesis. You start with observing something (hey I notice that bitcoin falls more in the weekends) and then just backtest the thing that you just observed (over the same period that you have just observed it in). \n\nFor example: I could just backtest all the days of the weeks seperatly for the last 12 weeks and identify per each day if the bitcoin price on average has risen more or dropped more. Then I could say well Bitcoin seems to go down on average on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday but goes up on average on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday but would you then really think that this says anything about how Bitcoin will perform in the futher on any of these days (beceause for me it certainly wouldnt). At I minimum I would then have to get data from a different data set and see if these findings still hold (which probably they wouldn't). \n\n",
