            "Text": "One very key reason why it's not coming back any time soon:\n\nBitcoin was relatively obscure until last year's run (yeah, I know some of you have been steeped in this stuff for a while) - the vast majority of people first became aware of it as an asset to be traded in the last 12 months.  It developed a brand identity (to the moon) and a mythology (if everyone moves from gold to bitcoin. . .if everyone realizes that cash money is inflationary. . .if everyone realizes the possibilities of bitcoin, yada, yada, yada. . .) that justified not only current insane valuations - but incredibly insane future projections (it's going to 50K, 100K. . .dare I say it? a million someday!!! - Lambos for everyone).  And that was fun for a while.\n\nBut it became an obvious bubble.  And the frothier it got, the more insane the mythologizing became and the dumber the money went in.  Stories started circulating of people maxing credit cards, taking second mortgages, deferring payment on student debt. . .bad bad stuff.\n\nPop\n\nNow it's brand is going to be:  \"oh yeah, bitcoin, that the thing my buddy lost his life savings on.\"  \"Q: How can you make a small fortune in bitcoin? A: Start with a large one.\"  Its quickly become a joke, a cautionary tail - right up there with - Tulips, Beanie Babies, Pokemon Cards. . .The branding is horrible now. Throw in the bitfinex/tether scam and there isn't going to be a recovery for this. The longer it stays here, the more sentiment will turn against it - the worse it will get. Forget smart money, even the dumb money is going to stay away for a long time to come.  \n\nRemember, the price is 100% psychology and the sentiment has turned sour.  The true believer level where you might find support is way south of where it is now.   ",

I often monitored the Reddit equivalent of the day (yahoo stock message boards) back in 2000 and 2001.   \n\nIf what I saw back then is any indicator,  we have not seen bottom.  In order for a true historically correct bottom,  you need to see mass 'capitulation'.  \n\nI learned this term AFTER the Internet bubble burst,  from talking heads on cable TV.   They defined it technically,  some shit like 'steeper than previous blah', plus other mumbo jumbo.\n\nI kind of went back over the message boards after the bubble , relishing all the flames I got as I was short and screaming 'bubble' almost from ATH. \n\nHere is what mass capitulation looked like on social media:\n\n1) quantity of posts (doesn't matter short/long)  drops off and stays off,  and get's noticed by the remaining.\n\n2) unless the poster is truly delusional (it's obvious) the delusional wishful thinking posts stop completely (all hope is lost?).\n\n3) celebrity 'posters'  (always long, today that's reddit,youtube,twitter, etc.) start to switch/defect,  mea culpa's , I'm sorry's,  etc.\n\n\nOther observations:\n\nThere is something about 50% as a mental threshold.   At the top of the Internet bubble,  I could get some of my friends to accept that things were headed down after rises & splits equalling maybe 800%.  For some reason everyone who agreed it was going down choose 50% as their expected drop?    The aggregate drop for all my friends and all our ESOP shares was closer to 85-90%.\n\nAnother interesting observation.  My circle of friends and associates working in the tech sector mostly worked at 5 big Silicone Valley tech firms.  Of those 5,  two no longer exist,  three are owned by Oracle.  The best recovery off of post burst ATL was 5 to 14,  then Oracle bought for 19.\n\nedit:format",

There are a few market manipulators with 100+ bitcoin that just sit around, wait for a steady downward 15 min trend to open up, then they buy 50-100 btc (which is enough to swing the price up a few hundred), then they sell gradually over the next few minutes. It's guaranteed profit given that the price is in a steady downward trend with low volume.",

Sure I could wait for it to go to 6k (it might I have no clue) but I also know that in the long term these coins are going to be worth a hell of a lot more than they are today.\n\nI'm trying to explain to family members the psychology that is so hard to shake in crypto. The desire to buy when prices are going up and the desire to sell when they are going down. The despair has set in here, people aren't buying and now it is time to make size-able purchases for the long term (trading stacks can be made after the rise IMO). \n\nI've NEVER been able to call a top or call a bottom perfectly however I have been able to see when we are blatantly too far in one direction.\n\nBTC (and other quality projects) will surpass its ATH again. The discount here is too great and the despair too strong. As I watch this break under 8k, I am checking that my Ledger is safe and calling my investment advisor for more funds.\n\nI know this may seem counter intuitive to many of you (especially newbies) but even if it takes 5 years I am certain that this technology will only being more ubiquitous in our lives.\n\nStrong Buy in my opinion at 10k or below.",

I bought during the massive bull run in December. \n\nIn case anyone is in the same position as me, here's my experience so far. \n\nI decided to sell a few days ago, even at a loss because there is a lot of uncertainty (lol) and it seemed to me (disclaimer: I know nothing about trading) like the price was headed down towards a major correction and I wanted to at least save some of my cash for potential purchases of BTC later. \n\nI don't really understand the 'HODL' argument unless you are prepared to see it go down to $500 before it goes to 10k, 15k, etc. I wanted to adopt a more proactive strategy and mitigate any future losses whilst also having cash to buy in at future opportunities. \n\nSo far it seems like I made the right decision. I bought in a little bit yesterday during the beginning of this drop and having one foot in, one foot out is working out ok so far.\n\nBest of luck everybody! ",

            "Text": "I've known about bitcoin for many years but only started investing in it when I heard about its gains in recent months.  Now, like others, I'm borderline obsessed with it.\n\nSo, as you've probably figured out, I've \"lost\" money since getting in.  However, I haven't sold off my investment, and I'm not trading on a margin.\n\nHere's the weirdest thing about it.  I'm not just investing, I'm learning.  Even though my portfolio has lost value, I feel richer in a sense, because I was never able to save money in the past and now I'm actually holding onto a chunk of something.  Also, experience has taught me that there is no such thing as wasted time.  You can learn from everything, both good and bad aspects.\n\nI'm a bullish noob.  I hold onto an asset that has recently lost value but has this amazing long term history of growth.  I'm kind of starting to understand the weak hands, strong hands concept.\n\nThese are a noobs two cents.\n",

I can't buy crypto there yet but I bought $700 worth of stocks. APPL, GE, AMD, a few others.  I was up a bit but after Friday's drop, I'm down like $20. \n\nAnd I recently bought in to Silver  1oz rounds, mostly American Eagles. I bought with fiat but interesting to note places like apmex and provident metals accept btc for payment as well. \nI'm in around 34 coins (34oz,around $600ish). \n\nMy investment plan:\n* For BTC, hold for around a year where I'll be in the green,  take out my initial investment, access market to figure out what to do with profits. \nMight add 50-200 month.\n\n*For stocks, regularly keep putting in 50 - 200 a month. Collect dividends, but otherwise stay in for at least 3 years. \n\n*Silver - Everything I'm buying is IRA eligible. My plan there is to have silver as a hedge against other investments, with flexibilkity to add to my IRA. It's also been almost a decade sense silver was at ATH, around $40 / oz. I'm In at 17$ ounce. \nIf it goes to over 30 is possibly sell some.\n\nLooking for advice on my plan above ",

            "Text": "Hello, first time commenter here. Been in this space for sometime though. I've delved deep into the tech and the story of this disruptive innovation. I am compelled to say this: it is incredible how threatened all the status quo parties are by this disruptive technology. I would like to point out the following: many news outlets reveal stories way after the fact to create fear: latest example the tether debacle that was one month old from when the media decided to spin in it two days ago 2) stories are manipulated to the point where it becomes a falsity ( example: india banning crypto, not true 3) There is a constant pressure to make sure that jack and jill don't buy crypto and get rich from it, which then leaves these very same status quo people holding the majority of the crypto... For instance today, many different media outlets are saying that banks are no longer accepting the use of their credit cards for crypto purchases. This is today's story. The banks are the very same people that feel totally threatened, so since they are the system, they are fighting back by telling you the client, what you are allowed and not allowed to buy using their credit card. Its irony at its finest. There is another amazing crypto payment platform called bitwala a german team offering a fantastic product, but the visa distributor that they had a deal with to print their crypto cards pulled the plug on them because VISA itself banned its distributor from supplying crypto payment platforms. You can see clearly- how those that are happy with the status quo will do everything they can to keep it at their controls. But what can one do? People are motivated by fear, and because their isn't a 'centralized' crypto front yet.. it is in its infancy can be compared to a baby going against 50 giants in battle... add to that people's greed at the same time, and u get a situation we are in now. I find it insane that a bank can tell me what i am not allowed to purchase with my money and facebook's zuckerberg who is part of the status quo (facebook technology is literally byzantine at this point) tells us what Ads we are allowed to see (he recently banned crypto Ads), while he receives billions for Ads we don't want to see. All i can say is this: blockchain is the people. Remember that. ",

There is no \"fundamental value\" - it's entirely dependent upon the market psychology at any given moment.  It's definitely not like a hard asset that produces a revenue stream.   It's not like a company that makes something and has an EBITDA and growth rate that can be analyzed.  It's not even like a commodity like oranges, or pork bellies, or oil that has an end user consumer and is a market based on demand for the asset itself.  It's not the least bit like gold that has desirable physical properties that make it useful for things.   \n\nThe value is only based on what people will pay for it, and they're only deciding what they will pay for it based on what they think they can get for it down the road.  The \"value\" fluctuates all the time.  \n\nIf we had a super computer, and could program it with a zillion variables that determine it's \"intrinsic value\" almost all of them would change as it approaches that value.  It's a little like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this regard.  \n\nThe market for bitcoin is 100% psychology - there are no fundamentals.\n\nPlay wisely.  ",

Bitcoin is like the internet in the early 90\u2019s.\n\nAnother fallacy is thinking that in order for Bitcoin to be successful, it has to replace national currencies all together. This is just too unrealistic and will never happen. There is no reason it can\u2019t coexist with fiat.\n\nThat being said, who the fuck knows how it will play out? Nobody.",

To improve security measures and possibly sell forked coins, I would like to transfer the funds to a new address.\n\nI understand the technical procedure - sweep the private key into a wallet software and send to the new address. But what security aspects should be considered?\n\nSome online resources recommend myCelium, but while I am cautious I do not trust my Android devices to be free of malware. I plan on using a PC with a Live CD linux distro (e.g. Ubuntu) installed on a fresh USB disk. What wallet and withdrawal procedure would you recommend? Does the Electrum Cold Storage feature has any benefits for a one time transaction?\n\nThanks!",

For me, the bitcoin is great, with great technology, and everybody says is backed on anything, I disagree on that, bitcoin is backed by trust, by a new kind of financial system that is totally new and we didn't even start to use the potential of it... bitcoin is going to be the Gold who is backing all the other crypto like gold/oil do for fiat... And that doesn't mean the fiat is going to end or disappear or the financial system is going to be replaced, sooner or later the big whales are going to have all the majority of the coins because they have strong hands, they have the means, they control governments, the media, and banking system, and they always win...  So, in the worst possible case I can lose 100% of investment (really doubt), but in other and we can make 2x; 4x; 10x; 100x; %, I'm going to ask you sincerely, Don't worth the risk to put that extra coin on crypto and hold to it??

Like it or not, now that the Feds and everyone else have caught on, Tether will no longer be \"printing\" 1 million Tethers every single day.  Crash to 5000 is imminent, and it will stay there until something PERMANENT is done about Tether and BitFinex.  Meanwhile, general population's trust in Crypto will take a very LONG time to recover.  If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at BitFinex and it's Tether ponzi scheme.  ",

            "Text": "I was on the boards back then, they were actually still pretty useful at that time IMO. I learned my lesson from then, def took a hit. \n\nIts definitely interesting how there is zero sense of panic here on reddit and this shit has dropped 60% already. And we are talking real money now, not when it was worth significantly less. People are getting destroyed in this drop but not a peep.\n\nThe sentiment reminds me of what I saw during the housing crash. I was flipping land in Florida.  Within a year of the peak which was actually in 2005, prices dropped a good 50% but there wasn\u2019t any panic.  By the following year lots were down a good 80% and people started to wake up a bit. Of course then you had the national crash and there was full blown panic, prices bottomed out around 90% lower and still have not recovered. \n\nIs this the path BTC will take?  Tune in.  Its definitely an issue for cryptos that the stock market is getting volatile again and risk is back on, the easy money has been made there.  People are not going to speculate in cryptos as much if the equity markets are no longer going up in a straight line.  In fact expect the opposite response. \n\n",

Everybody uses the internet comparison, I like to use the synthesised music and production equipment, which started in the late 50s and early 60s with quirky scientists and professors who got fired for wasting university funds for these useless, refrigerator sized beep-machines, but in the late 60s and 70s started to give us psychedelic rock and dub/Sound System culture among others. Fast forward to 2018, mainstream music is mostly electronic, underground electronic music can have musical ideas arrangements and frequency planes that couldn't have even been imagined before, and anybody can have access to hundreds of physical or imagined instruments and percussion at their disposal, live, while mixing it with \"traditional\" instrumentalism.\n\nI don't think we've even seen cryptocurrecy's Jimi Hendrix Experience yet.",

By the time I'd finished putting all the money into bitcoin that I was going to, it was over 18k. I remember hesitating to put more in when it crossed 11k. It started going up so fast at that point that something just felt wrong. But being new to the market, I didn't know any better and quickly replaced that thought with *the longer I wait, the more expensive it will be*. And instead of holding back, I just continued to buy until I'd finished putting in all the money I'd allocated for it. ",

From there who knows, many alts would die and possibly btc as well. I, for one, don't see that happening. I see BTC rising back to 12k-13k a lot quicker than people think.",

I read some of it,  to be honest,  I bailed when I read something I thought was weird,  probably mining.  \n\nAt the time it hadn't been up very long,  I think a bitcoin was < one penny.  \n\nMan I wish so badly now that I knew Satoshi was pseudonym back then, I could have flamed back!  Oh,  and the money thing too :>",

Even back then people were in personal battles with themselves about whether they should sell at 15$ or wait for $20 and risk the chance it could go back down to 10$. They were all thinking short term, when little did they know long term it would go higher. Money is money. No one wants to lose it.  People's psychological reactions are the same no matter what price Bitcoin is. ",

However, it always ends up rising from the dust. In the end, the most important thing is people's mental health. Can they handle these types of drops. This is similar to the dot.com bubble. People said the Internet would die off after the dot.com bubble popped, but it's still here and bigger then ever. Bitcoin is paving a way, and new paths are never ever straight and easy. ",

Bitcoin bubble from last  year made it posibble.\n\n\n Who ever is involved in technology in any way realise the enormous step that has been taken last year. Of course major public understood it in a way that you can speculate on price and thats what happening. But we are in such a early stage of this that aside from price speculating a lot of people dont see the big picture.\n\n\n This is not only new technology it's deaply changing world structure.",

I only put in what I could afford to lose.\n\nI started when it first hit 1k and subsequently crashed to 200 and bought  more to lower my cost basis. I was in the red for years. The nice thing about wanting 10x+ gains is you treat it as an all or nothing bet. It was never an investment, it was a bet, so I was fully willing to lose all my money.\n\nHad I over invested I might have panic sold after my first crash, or sold after only a 2x gain for fear of losing it all. This is why people suggest only invest what you can lose.\n\nFor what it's worth I don't think bitcoin will see a 50x gain ever again.

            "Text": "Nobody wants to get stuck holding the bag if/when the exchanges shut down. The exchanges might well be solvent, but if they've committed fraud they're still going to go down in flames.\n\nIf Bitfinex goes dark tomorrow, a huge amount of cash will disappear from the ecosystem overnight, and prices will plummet. Everything about Bitfinex is really obviously dodgy, so the chances of them getting charged with fraud given that they're being investigated is very high. There's even an outside chance multiple exchanges will go down, if they've been colluding --- which doesn't look unlikely.\n\nYou can say that \"the market is pricing the risk in\", but you don't need to be so abstract. From the individual's perspective, it's simple: If you wait until the news is confirmed and the exchanges are actually being prosecuted, it'll likely be too late. The price will plummet and you might not even be able to get your trades in, let alone get cash out. So everyone wants to sell now.",

            "Text": "Like I said it is a mildly educated guess. \n\nIt is based on my explanation of how bitcoin went over $1k and 2k and stayed there in the first place. That did not happen by everyday working class Redditors buying $100 here and there on Coinbase. \n\nThe best explanation is that one or a few of the wealthiest people in the world started steadily accumulating some time ago. There are a handful of risk taking, technically accomplished people who could buy every last bitcoin available for $1000 each and still be seriously wealthy. And some of them have even made positive comments about bitcoin.\n\nIt is likely that they stopped accumulating at some point between $1500 and, $2k or $3k. At that point the momentum driven speculative mania took over. And they knew this was likely to happen. If it didn't happen then they could just keep on accumulating a higher and higher portion of all the coins. So if they thought bitcoin had a good chance of lots of future adoption and utility they were in a win-win scenario. It is a reasonable risk for someone like that to take when they would still have tens of billions or so, no matter what happened. \n\nThat is how I estimate where the floor is. And I think it is likely to go down some more towards that floor because $7000 or $8000 bitcoin changes the calculations entirely (and they already have lots of coins from previous accumulation, so no need to follow the price up), and is a very high price to maintain with 12.5 new coins being mined every 10 minutes.

Highly unlikely it's going to be approved, and if it is, the information will be passed on to tax authorities due to AML and KYC regulations passed in the last few years. So it seems to me if for example EU, China and US passes legislation to disallow exchanges - then it could well kill cryptotrading, as the exchanges are the chokepoint. \n\nUnless there is other ways to get into/out of crypto that doesn't need exchanges, but I'm not aware of any?",

Tapping into high interest credit card debt can destroy your returns.\n\n2. Pay off all high interest debt\n\n3. Max out 401k match\n\n4. Max out HSA if available\n\n5. Max out Roth IRA\n\n6. Invest in low fee broad based ETF's. About 85-90% of your porfolio\n\n7. Invest about 10-15% in individual stocks, gold, other speculative investments",

If you're as good as you think you are then why not sell before the crashes and buy in at the bottom? That way you could make money continuously without having to hold the whole time. You know, like professional investors do. Is your investment portfolio diversified and do you hedge your investments? That way you could sell off your bitcoin at the start of a crash and jump back in, slowly, as the price climbs back up. If you're planning on just sitting on the coin you have and coming back in five years time then you really must have diversified, right? ",

Gox - caught my attention,  read two or three things.\n\n\n7 months ago - I actually don't remember ,  but I was checking out at my local high end grocery store with 20 something educated checkout dude.  I don't know how he managed to bring it up,  I'm not chatty,  but he gave me the 'have you heard about bitcoin?'.  Before I could respond he got out something about $5000 and $6000,  so I'm guessing bitcoin was $5000 and he said It was going to $6000?  I went through the '87 crash and the 2001 bubble,  so all I said to him is \"have you read about tulips?\".  I'll never forget his look of total confusion,  his face said  \"why the fuck are you talking about tulips?\"\n\nAnyway,  that's when bitcoin went mainstream, in my little world.\n\nSo I don't care too much what happened to bitcoin prior to a year ago.\n",

Can't even lie convincingly, probably thinks based on YouTube videos he hardly grasps that he's a great trader, and takes his frustrations of not having anything of value to say out by littering Reddit with insults like \"you utter lampshade\", \"how can you go through life being this slow\", or \"you table top\". Please don't feed the troll.\n\nEdit: Looks like Cheeseboxcity and the other poster removed their posts. Cheeseboxcity was claiming that there are hundreds of coins such that if you invested $100 in Jan 2017, you'd now have at least $1m worth. The other poster was calling him on this nonsense.",

None. \n\nI perfectly understand the advantages of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. \n\nBut you didn't answer the qustion, though. \"Why would John Doe of Bumblefuck, Arkansas currently invest in bitcoin?\"\n\n\"Digital scarcity\" is a concept, not an answer to that question.\n\nThe answer is: \"he wouldn't\"\n\nUnless he was buying drugs online, he would have no use of Bitcoin, compared to US dollars. \n\nIt could be a good investment, sure.

            "Text": "I'm not talking about day trading. The ATH was over a month ago now. Let's assume a reversal happens soon, it could well be about two months later. That isn't day trading.\n\nEmotions do get in the way and, to be honest, that gives away the fact that this is your first time playing at being an investor, along with your initial prediction that we are in the middle of a reversal.\n\nI'd be very interested in reading those articles explaining the 300,000 USD valuation, if you wouldn't mind linking them then I'd be very grateful.\n\nYou can't compare btc to stocks though. That's the problem. It acts in an entirely different way and, importantly, is a zero sum game. Currently, bitcoin value is entirely speculative. Stocks have actual material value meaning they can be calculably over and under valued, which is how investors choose stocks. Bitcoin cannot be described as over or under valued on any material basis. You can't treat btc as a similar investment for that reason. Diversifying into other coins may work within the self-contained crypto market but if the whole crypto market tanks then you will realise you haven't actually diversified at all. With the amount of money you're investing I would consider looking at property, stocks and precious metals. That all assumes you have the time to monitor your investments every day. \n\nYour trading goal sounds interesting but it is based on the belief that btc has to go up, so everything you hold is relative to a volatile product. This is why currency was invented and why people usually trade with/against currency.",

Considering the average [lifetime value of a customer to a bank](http://www.michaelhaenlein.eu/Publications/Haenlein,%20Michael%20-%20A%20model%20to%20determine%20customer%20lifetime%20value%20in%20a%20retail%20banking%20context.pdf), $100 is pretty cheap, even with extrapolated attrition rates.",

I still don't see how you jump to that being religion though.\n\nBy definition belief is simply the act of considering something is true, or to hold as an opinion (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/believe).\n\nConsider these sentences: \"I believe the reports.\" \"You wouldn't believe how long it took.\" \"I believe you.\" \"I Couldn't believe my ears.\" \n\nI just don't think of religion or church in any of those sentences.\n\nI do agree with you that belief is a central tenant for all religions and scams though. They are also central tenants in about everything really. I wouldn't go to worship if I didn't believe there was a point to it. I wouldn't watch the news if I didn't believe they told me important things. I wouldn't drive to work if I didn't believe that I could get there safely.",

With these you simply deposit the money you would like to invest and they purchase a portfolio of Vanguard ETFs for you.

In this sense, bitcoin will always be the most battle-tested coin.\n\nOf course, given that noone is in charge and it\u2019s based on consensus, development is slow.

In my own personal experience it just seems crazy. I was really just trying to understand the mentality behind your decisions by throwing out there what I would consider the smart move.\n\nIf it btc has gone to the moon in a year then I'll be happy to congratulate you. Still doesn't make a lack of diversification the smart move. Some people in the subreddit just aren't playing it safe enough with their savings (normally jumped in after 7500 or 10,000 dollars) and it hurts to watch these daily threads with people getting so dejected by a downtrend and elated at a slightly bullish correction. Investing shouldn't be that emotional. \n\nAnd, by the way, I day trade for a living by scalping on the foreign exchange market so, from where I'm sitting, waiting a couple of months is a medium term strategy and defintely not day trading.",

            "Text": "First of all I am not saying Bitcoin is a religion.  It is the mentality of OP (and some others i have heard talk about Bitcoin) that has very strong similarities to religion IMHO.  People believe the earth is flat, I don't think that is a religion, nor do I think any of your examples constitutes religion.  Never did I say believing something constitutes religion.  When it starts getting into the grey area is when \"faith\" starts to become involved.  Consider OP's comment:\n\n> Am I worried? No. I believe in the technology and I believe believers will be rewarded handsomely.\n\n\nHe believes in the technology, but what else does he believe?  That \"believers will be rewarded handsomely\".  No maybe he has cracked the code, that I have seen no-one else crack, which is how you put an intrinsic discounted value on an asset that doesn't generate income, doesn't store value well, and doesn't have much of a practical use at this time. \n\nSince of all analysis's i have read about Bitcoin I have not seen one single one that can make a compelling case for a solid valuation.  Shoot OP makes no indication he is even using TA to guess where the price will go.  \n\nSo what makes him so sure that \"believers\" will be rewarded?  Though he doesn't say it explicitly it sounds a lot like faith to me. \n\nAll of the examples of belief you gave do not involve faith for your belief to be true, or is your utility of the subject effected by wether you \"believe\" or not.  For example your car, you actually believing your car will work has no bearing on wether it will actually work.  You could absolutely believe your car will break down tomorrow every day until it does, but I think if someone told you \"my car broke down today, but I believe in the technology so I believe it will work tomorrow\"  you would probably think they are crazy.  They didn't say it, but they are implying that their faith in their car alone will make it work. If you thought this way about your car then, yes I would say that is bordering on religion.  \n\n",

You only need a low chance of 10-100x increases for the chance of losing some of all of your 1 to be worth taking. Considering that bitcoin's potential user base consists of anyone with internet access, and that it has powerful never before seen capabilities, the 10-100x scenarios do have real chances of playing out. \n\n>That still doesn't concretely explain why mr. Average Joe would invest in bitcoin over whatever else, except that \"he would expect monetary gains\".\n\nThere is no single reason. I have multiple reasons myself. Mr. Average Joe American might have less reason than most because he lives in a country with a high amount of financial freedom and a stable, reliable currency. But then again us Americans do like our disintermediation, and Arkansas good old boys are certainly no exception to that. \n\n>Blockchain is likely a part of the future, but it is still largely reserved to internet anarchists (in a lack of a better term), criminals and somewhat tech-savy people.\n\nI don't think tech-savy is wrong, but it is an imperfect or incomplete account. Being tech-savy might help you in a practical sense, making a wallet and sending transactions and stuff, and help you understand the security of PK crypto, but really it is a sense of historical perspective and understanding the true nature of money that does more than anything else to give a person a good chance of understanding bitcoin's potential. \n\nAs far as criminals using bitcoin, of course every big technological advancement ever has been utilized by criminals. I don't use drugs, but I get that black markets are a universal occurrence, and the fact that bitcoin has it's roots in them is one of the things that gave me confidence that it could really become a thing. I mean, really, if you can't buy drugs with your money, it's not money.",

Considering that bitcoin's potential user base consists of anyone with internet access, and that it has powerful never before seen capabilities, the 10-100x scenarios do have real chances of playing out.\n\nCouldn't the same be said for basically every other crypto?\n\n",

If you open a Vanguard account and buy Vanguard ETFs, there are no fees either.\n\nSo basically the advantage is diversification. With a total market ETF you're guaranteed to match the market returns (usually about 7% a year). Choosing your own stocks will usually be lower than that over time, unless you really know what you're doing, and even then it's risky. That's why most experts advise keeping the bulk of your retirement/long term savings in ETFs and having a small 5-10% portion devoted to speculative investments like crypto, individual stocks, etc.",

            "Text": "Bitcoin's authenticity is what sets it head and shoulders above other cryptos, USD and especially gold are even more authentic if we are talking about assets generally.\n\nThere is no way for a new asset class to bootstrap it's way from being worth pennies and then thousands of dollars and then who knows how much more without volatility along the way. \n\nEven gold is not all that stable, though it has been used for 9000 years. For many people like me the risk that comes with the volatility of bitcoin's price is worth it when weighed against the potential upside. There just are not all that many bitcoins, and there are very many potential users and use cases, and the supply is virtually completely inelastic, unlike gold, which is only inelastic in comparison to  manufactured goods or fiat currencies.\n\nUnlike the Zimb or US dollar I can send a bitcoin to anyone anywhere in the world without the approval of various governments and financial institutions. That is very powerful technology. \n\n",
