            "Text": "FEAR, THE ENEMY OR ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL MAN?\n\nFriends, let's talk about fear, this text requires your thoughtful reading, only then you will feel its influence and the proper effect of the right settings. Although my pardon for some pieces that would be ridiculous to simplify depriving intellectual load.\n\nTo understand that fear as a great motivator, and the main enemy of a man setting great goals, let's look at the example of one famous film \"The Dark Knight: the Restoration of the Legend.\" As you remember the hero, trying to get out of the pit trying to make the final jump without fear of death, only after the edification of one of his cellmates, he again felt fear, it was this metamorphosis of the spirit that helped him get out and make the final successful leap to freedom. But what is fear in business and in particular such as the manipulation of crypt?\n\nIt would seem that the answer is obvious, and fear is the main scourge to be burned with iron, while most successful people have become successful due to fear not realizing themselves, fear of remaining at the same level, fear of continuing to ride their whole lives on the bus and never seeing envious glances gapers accompanying you on an expensive Mercedes.\n\nIn order not to enter into a long and fruitless philosophy and to maximally turn fear into a weapon of your desires, you should follow a simple but wise formula:\n\n\u00a0A.\\) Fear should not be overwhelming, it must accompany any initiative if you are at the \"0\" point forcing you to work more intensively, accumulate knowledge, think, respond with the blow to blow \\(if required\\) and experience a neurotic dissatisfaction with your current dispositions. At the same time, by \"overwhelming\" I mean that if fear is incomprehensible, if it becomes a tyrant not allowing you to associate two words in an interview, an important presentation or an examination, this is not the positive fear that we need, for any fear that is beginning to be the main scourge that you must send it to the trash can. It's about your fear of not success, that great motivator that awakens in you the desire to cultivate, including if you need to have yourself. I'm sure I do not need to talk about the perniciousness of the state of peace and contentment for the ambitious personality that accompanies the life of most people. They weave their lives from the search for the destruction of the discomfort of the internal states, the minimal need to survive, thereby displacing the fear of failure and have the opposite psychological attitude \\- the fear of starting, whereas your fear is the fear of not bringing it to the end, the fear of not achieving the desired level gives you a clear advantage over these people, who will forever remain cogs of the system. As Dostoevsky wrote, \"the thirst for education is aristocratic thirst\", i.e. the one who wants to be educated already sees himself equal to the best representatives of society, while the one who supersedes the image of the future will never have it.\n\n\u00a0B.\\) In my experience, I should note that when you have already left the \"0\" point and you can breathe with proper comfort and say to yourself, \"I'm worth something,\" then another approach to such a strong phenomenon of human nature as fear. Since success has already been achieved, the goal is the preservation of the acquired benefits, and it already requires a sober calculation and a cold head, where there is no room for fear, as in a casino, having won a solid sum, you need to say to yourself: \"Stop, sooner or later the red will drop out and I will lose everything ! \" only an idiot continues to raise rates, Afraid not to win more and sooner or later suffers a fiasco returning to that very point ZERO.\n\nSo, as you can see, to get out of the hole shown in the film you must fearfully remain afraid to stay in it and not making the desired, but getting out and reaching the height your guiding task is to search for a fearless and pragmatic approach to the routine of life. Guided by these simple psychological techniques, you will sooner or later get out of the hole of obscurity, neurosis, and poverty, become the lords of fear and the leaders of your fearlessness, becoming a successful crypto",

Historically, buying while the price is moving sideways, and \"BTC is boring and dead\" has worked very well. If history repeats (no guarantee it will), long term accumulation and hodling, will outperform active trading. ",
