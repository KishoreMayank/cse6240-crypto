Going offline for a substantial amount of time is dangerous only if: you have been receiving substantial payments + the counterparty (the one sending those payments) wants to cheat you + you are not back online for a long time after the cheating attempt (like a few days or a week or so). Only **then** you might lose those received payments (because the cheater will come away with his cheating attempt). Remember, a cheater loses his entire channel balance if you notice his cheat attempt (and he probably doesn't know you're offline anyway), which should strongly disincentivize cheating attempts in the first place.  \n\nSimply taking your node offline does not do anything to your funds. \n",

It promises to move the majority of transactions off chain.\n\n>And interesting info about lite wallets and watchtowers + the need for quite pricey hardware for 3rd world citizens who were used to defend small block limit in the first case. \n\npoor people don't use bitcoin so any such justification was flawed from the beginning. the price is too volatile for poor people to bear the risk.\n\nactually the main reason you want l2 solutions is because if the blockchain becomes too large the number of full nodes will go down and bitcoin will become centralized.",
