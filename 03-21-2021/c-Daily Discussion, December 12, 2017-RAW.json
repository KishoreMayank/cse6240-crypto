CNBC obviously wants to knock crypto down a few pegs because it doesn't fit their agenda. It's laughable",

All this adds up to people who hodl have sell resistance to prices above 1000 a coin (resistance to dumping) and quite frankly with wall street have their eyes set on 3-15 trillion market cap, meaning they have sell resistance below 150k per BTC.\nmeanwhile if the definition of a cornered market is the control of 2/3 or a commodity supply, then though they are not united, as a psychological group they have btc cornered. do something to change their minds and watch out, otherwise, all wall st can do is push the cap.",

And the original adoptees of the system are likely to be idealistic at least in terms of decentralisation and transparency. \n\nDo you think that those factors may lead to some sort of social/cultural change (dare not say revolution) in the next 30-50 years as the new wealth generation matures and wants to make an impact?\n\nI have no doubt that the Blockchain is a revolutionary concept and will be a technological revolution, but it's whether it actually makes a social impact or not that I find interesting. The Internet sure did. ",

I see a lot of new friends in the subreddit, and 90% of times most people is worried if this is a good time to buy.\n\nLet me try to make this even more clear. RIGHT NOW is always the best time to buy btc. It's always gonna be \"too expensive\" (unless your hunting those dips).\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that even if it goes down just after you buy, it will surely go up again and even further.\n\nA few weeks ago (or so) I bought around 10k USD in bitcoin just after it went pass the 7k price tag. Bought at 7k and by the time I was leaving my office it was around 7700k. I thought to myself I did the perfect trade. By the time I got home, I read about Segwit2x cancelation and the market quickly fell, putting the price at around 5k. So in just a few minutes I had lost around 3-4k USD. A few days went through before the price recovered.\n\nDid I panicked and sold? No. Do I still hold those Bitcoins? Damn right. Hopefully my story is useful for some of y'all :).",

It was to test transfering from GDAX to my Ledger Nano S, so I only sent 0.0001 Bitcoin.\nGDAX reduced my stored Bitcoin by 0.0001 and on my Ledger I now have 0.0001 Bitcoin. My question is about the transaction outputs, see https://blockchain.info/tx/3c6fc753dd3a4600fea876d90c0bb7725e3c26c723f20f66abba40e6d84872a1?show_adv=true\n\nI understand that GDAX has paid the fee, but I don't understand this output:\n14aw4UHh5AsY5M7EoyNRocJKX16reRAnWr - 0.00000703 BTC\n\nWhat address is this? Why has this extra amount been sent (which also wasn't taken from my GDAX account)?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Is it a change address of GDAX?",

Just.. for the sake of argument and nice round numbers, say my taxable income is $60,000 and I bought 1 Bitcoin at $5,000, HODL for over a year, and sell it next year at $25,000. When I bought the Bitcoin I was at $60,000 salary and in the Long Term Capital Gains 0% range, but if I cash out fully I have now profited $20,000 and that bumps me out of the 15% Income Tax bracket. Would I owe Long Term Capital Gains tax of 0% or 15% (because I got bumped above the 15% Income Tax)?",

Is it possible to switch from 4mb blocks back down to 1mb during times of lower tx volume or does block size need to be fixed at all times? \n\nThere has been so much interest and new users coming to bitcoin, which is amazing but the way things have been for the last week has shown the vulnerabilities when faced with high tx volume.\n\nI'm hoping the tx backlog is temporary, that it's down to new users getting in on the bitcoin train but I am concerned that it's not showing bitcoin in the best possible light and is allowing other coins to capitalise on that \n\n",

Smart Contracts \u2013 Unlike the original BTC, SuperBTC will be able to support smart contracts just like ETH.\n\n2. Lightning network \u2013 It is way faster than the original BTC after which no one no longer needs to wait ages for transactions to occur.\n\n3. Zero Knowledge Proof \u2013 This tech will allow one to hide their wallet address when performing transactions.\n\n4. Bigger Block Size \u2013 This will allow more scalability on the chain itself for the coins to thrive.\n\n\nApparently they\u2019re backed by Bitfinex in the list of supporters they posted. Let\u2019s see....\n\nAnyone knows if TREZOR / LEDGER are supporting this too by claiming the new coin in their apps?",

            "Text": "All of them should. Remember, crypto is not actually physically stored/downloaded on the wallet. The wallet only provides access to the blockchain. The crypto is stored on the blockchain network.  Lets say you setup a new Bitcoin wallet using Jaxx, you can write down the recovery/backup words and then import them into a Mycelium wallet. Using those words, the Mycelium wallet creates access using the same private key that you had on the Jaxx wallet. So you can use Jaxx AND Mycelium at the same time and both will display your current amount of Bitcoin since it is the same key.",

            "Text": "Bitcoin has the largest and most diverse pool of developers, so the support for improving and scaling Bitcoin is strong.  Other alts have 1 or 2 man development \"teams\" (most are just abandon-ware/scams/shitcoins). Some of the bigger platforms such as Etherium (note: Etherium is a platform, not a currency but it does have its own tokens) have larger dedicated teams of developers. So, in terms of store of value Bitcoin is the biggest that we have so far because it has the most stable technology and has the biggest development support.  Also, I agree, if another alt gets Amazon, its value will go through the roof. Chances are that amazon will actually create their own currency/token instead of adopting Bitcoin or any other alt coin.",

At that point 1 BTC will equal 1 BTC. [insert Morpheus meme].\n\nEdit: In the meantime, we find ourselves in a transition period, where I imagine the growth rate *of the growth rate* of the value of 1 BTC will follow a logarithmic curve. When will the inflection point occur, if ever? Not sure anyone knows when at this point. I estimate that around $70,000-100,000/BTC price point, the big players (Wal-mart, Amazon) would *have* to accept BTC as a means of exchange and that (while not accelerating price growth) would lead to the psychological shift. In other words, big player adoption likely occurs after mass consumer adoption.",

Looks like they spent months on designing the website and ten minutes proofreading it.\n\nHilariously enough, if you Google \"UnitedBitcoin\" they aren't even on the first page of results. It's ub.com for anyone interested in checking it out.",

Everyone is going to create their own tokens at varying prices and we will be exchanging/bartering coins for goods with blockchain running/storing \"conversions\" from one token to another.  It is possible that what we know as Bitcoin will become some sort of point of reference or even a store of value instead of an actual value exchange medium.

We are part of a strong, intelligent and massive community. We just can't go down that easily. Now what if nothing terrible happens, what if Bitcoin continues to fluctuate as it always does, but with it's solid upward trend. What if we slowly reach 100k? Well, it wasn't that big of a risk, wasn't it?",

            "Text": "Not quite.\n\nEvery bitcoin address is comprised of two parts, the public address and a private key. The public address is the thing people send coin to and the private key is what you need to spend the money.\n\nA wallet is a collection of addresses. Modern wallets are called deterministic  wallets. The wallet itself has a master private key that it uses to generate all the addresses. The wallet master key is a long string of bits so in order to make it easier for humans we often represent this as 24 words. This is called a seed because you use it to generate addresses.\n\nIf you have your money on an exchange you don't have your seed and you don't have your keys. In a very real sense you don't actually have any bitcoin.\n\nEvery serious modern wallet will use the seed system and they will have you write down your seed on a piece of paper when you initialize the wallet. With this piece of paper you can then access your wallet from any good wallet software by just using the restore from backup option. \n\nThe seed IS you bitcoin. If someone has the seed they have the coins. If you don't have your seed you don't have your coins and if you don't have your coins you can't guarantee that you will get anything in a split.\n\nIn short, get a good wallet. Either a hardware one like trezor or ledger or a good app version like mycelium or bread. Transfer most of your coin to this wallet and be extremely careful with how you store your backup and other codes. Do not keep a lot of coins on exchanges or non-seed online wallets, it isn't your money.",

Two different things here. Ether can be used as a \"currency\" between these smart contracts, but it is not meant to be used as a retail point-of-purchase currency. Etherium definitely has a future in terms of things like storing real-estate deeds, decentralized uber-style applications, etc. Bitcoin has a future in terms store of value and as an actual digital currency that you can buy stuff with.  Both have strong philosophy and strong development teams working on improving and mass adoption, but, they are used for different things. I would hodl both if you can afford it.",

I believe they work on it for free (or donations). If someone wants to make a change they can develop it and present it to all the nodes and miners and users for review. If it gets enough consensus then it can be implemented as a soft fork or hard fork. Exchangers and wallet providers then integrate it if they want to. \nThe most promising scaling solutions are additional layers to the blockchain (see lightning network). These won't interfere with the main chain at all so anyone can develop it and people will use it if it's good. ",

The Cbeo folks are just trading paper  - not BTC - every 30 days for a shot at a profit. Many will (or many others will) be inspired to invest in the actual BTC itself.\n\nAll in all a positive IMO.",

The problems with Bitcoin are being addressed, and they will be implemented as soon as they are ready.  This is a GOOD thing, Bitcoin is primarily a store of value right now (and will likely be THE store of value) so it's extremely important that it's secure.  This is all *imo* of course, but I think most of the complaints are very short sided and/or maliciously motivated (i.e. BCash shills).",

A hardware wallet also displays these seed words for you to write down and secure. You do not need to have a hardware wallet, but it is more safer for large amount of Bitcoin since it is not directly connected to the internet.  A note on keeping Bitcoin on Coinbase: Never do that. Coinbase does not give you access to your private key (or the seed words) which means that they have full control over your Bitcoin which means that you effectively do not own \"your\" Bitcoin. Always move your coins to a wallet that allows you access to the private keys as well as the seed words.",

For now, I'm comparing this to what is happening on the small screen show development. Companies like Netflix and Amazon creating their own shows with the hopes of drawing us viewers in to their subscriptions. I think crypto may play out in such a way where we \"subscribe\" to our \"favorite\" retailers and use their tokens with some sort of backend/background exchange algorithm..  Its a crazy future.",

I think you need to do your research on hard forks: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp\n\nThe basics are that a hard fork is when Bitcoin splits (maybe think about duplicating) into a new currency. Let's call them Old Bitcoin and New Bitcoin (in this instance: Bitcoin and Super Bitcoin). The New Bitcoin is a different crypto algorithm and rules, usually. When the fork happens everyone who had Old Bitcoin now has the same amount of New Bitcoin. You access this through usually a new wallet app with your old private keys, the process varies, but when you get access you are then free to trade it.\n\nIf you're excited about free money then when you get access (claim) your New Bitcoin you can send it to an exchange and usually somebody will trade it for Old Bitcoin at about 1/10th of the original value. Good luck!",

Coinbase is relatively safe to keep small amounts on.  If you have a LOT of Bitcoin on the exchange, I would just eat the fee and move the Bitcoin to a wallet that you control the private keys. Coinbase does not give you access to your private keys, and in the world of crypto, if you don't own your keys you don't own your crypto. In terms of using GDAX, that will save you the exchange fees, but the mining fees (those are the high ones right now due to the volumes), those will stay the same and would have to be paid.",

If you use Coinbase to buy, you will pay the Coinbase transaction fee, then, you will want to move your purchase off Coinbase into a wallet. At this point you will be charged a mining fee for this \"transaction\". So, to buy, you will be effectively charged 2 fees. You can use other exchanges such as Gemini or GDAX which charge much lower buy/transaction fees (in fact, GDAX does not charge a fee if you buy in a certain way), but once you move the purchase off the exchange, you will still be charged a mining fee (which goes to the miners and not to the exchange).",

But there are transaction fees and they are relatively high right now.\n\nAlso, you don't need to do this but I advice you to do a bank wire transfer to Coinbase instead of using a credit card. It's cheaper to begin with. When you've done that you can move the money from Coinbase to Gdax (which is also owned by Coinbase, you just use the same account that you have on Coinbase to login). Moving it from Coinbase to Gdax is completely free. When you've successfully moved the money to Gdax you can buy bitcoins with no fee by placing a limit order. This is slightly more difficult but it's extremely easy to learn if you're willing to. Just YouTube it! :)",

You are owed 1 coin by me and this is written in the ledger by the local accountant. Imagine that someone came up to this accountant and said 'hmmm...I see what you're doing, but I could do it better' they then take that same ledger *with all of the existing credits and debits* and copy it but use their own methods to make note of credits and debits going forward. \n\nWhat this means, in terms of the blockchain, is that there is an existing ledger (Bitcoin) and now new ledgers (Bcash and Bitcoin Gold) which do things differently in some ways. As these are based on the existing, original, ledger pre-existing credits/debits have to be honoured. Hence, any coins you had on the old ledger are also there in these other ledgers so you now have 1 coin on each ledger. \n\nSo...you have credits in these three ledgers. What you do with each of them (eg sell one to buy more of the other or otherwise just hodl each of them) is up to you. Bear in mind that each of these coins have a different perceived value so you can't buy/sell them for equal quantities. You have to understand that they are now completely different coins.\n\nDoes that help to clarify?",
