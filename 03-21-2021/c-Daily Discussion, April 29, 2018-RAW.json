When the Bitcoin dominance is low, the total number of Bitcoin that the crypto-market is worth gets higher.  \n\nCurrently the crypto-market is worth around 46 million Bitcoin at 36.6%.  When Bitcoin dominance percentage increases in this space, the number of Bitcoin that the crypto-space is worth becomes less.\n\nMany of these alts are only 'whitepapers,' no working products, billion-dollar promises, or worse.  \n\nI don't feel that the alt-markets are at completely irrational levels yet, though.  There aren't really any alts I would gamble my Bitcoin on right now though.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some amazing projects out there.  I don't feel that any alts are actually direct competitors to Bitcoin, however.",

Remember, the coinmarketcap.com market cap amount is based on circulating supply not total supply!!!! \n\nFor example, Ontology 112,619,658 ONT circulating, but total are 1,000,000,000 ONT. So true market cap is about $8,600,000,000. Ontology could someday be worth much more, but it's speculation on a company with no final product yet.\n\nI'm not bashing ontology ( I might buy some), but these valuations are in the range of some established companies with profits, real estate holdings, etc.\n\n(BTW I like Ardor because it has a working product and is cheap, though their marketing sucks)",

            "Text": "Exactly. It is always the convenience of being out and spontaneously wanting to go somewhere, or to an event etc. I shouldn't get punished 20% of the time I want to use an ATM for convenience. Exchanges are fine, but they have their issues. It's not always super quick. Sometimes there are delays. Sometime they freeze accounts. Sometimes they send your information to banking companies and they shut you down. It's unfortunate now cause I'll just stick to an exchange and then what, get my account shut down for banking with crypto. There's always someone trying to rob you, sometimes it's a guy in a suit and not some dude with a fucking knife. ",

Dies kann etwa durch den Umtausch in Fiatw\u00e4hrungen, das Traden gegen andere Kryptow\u00e4hrungen oder das Bezahlen f\u00fcr Waren oder Dienstleistungen geschehen. Somit f\u00e4llt nicht nur der Verkauf seiner Kryptow\u00e4hrungen unter eine etwaige Steuerpflicht, sondern jede einzelne Transaktion einer Kryptow\u00e4hrung, da auch in kleineren F\u00e4llen Gewinnrealisierungen anfallen. Auch beim Traden oder Zahlen gilt es deshalb, auf die Ums\u00e4tze Acht zu geben.\"\n\nIn short: Every transaction is a taxable event, also trading between coins. If you didn't hold the coin for at least a year (FIFO rule applies), before making a transaction with it, you have to pay tax on the value it gained between purchase and transaction.",
