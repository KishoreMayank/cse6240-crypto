I did find this article online that had a very encouraging quote at the end:\n\n>Blaskey believes that the SEC will approve a cryptocurrency ETF over the next six to eight months. \"Everyone was nervous,\" he said. \"Now we're in calmer times. Cryptocurrency is more politically palatable.\"\n\nFrom this post: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/sec-to-review-second-bitcoin-etf-14872758\n\nWe will see what happens I guess.   If they think BTC is \"calmer\" they are probably in for a surpise though.  It seems calm before it isn't. ;)  Has Bitcoin ever really been that \"calm?\"  I guess if we look at months, but not at years!",

Scarcity alone does not imply value, especially if there's infinitely many functionally identical alternatives.\n\nThis is provable by looking at coinmarketcap.com ... some people prefer Coke, and believe it's the one true cola, but there's a dozen other coins with a 1B+ market cap.

            "Text": ">Just wait my friend, there's only going to ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence and there are over 8 billion people on this planet, throw in demand and publicity and just watch what happens.\n\nThat feels like a limitation though. If Bitcoin were to become a global currency, most people must be able to access it. Also, if the value fluctuates insanely, it will force retailers to reprice daily because if BTC was a global currency, things would be priced in BTC. BTC's volatility is why some major companies have stopped using it as a payment option, e.g. Steam and Microsoft. I do not see them re-adding it until it becomes stable. It only becomes stable once BTC is priced high enough that whales cannot no longer massively influence the price but the price only raises and stays up there if major adoption occurs, so there is a clear paradox there.\n\n>I said something about hyperinflated countries, people in those situations NEED Bitcoin.\n\nIs there any significant reason for them to buy Bitcoin over other currencies, like USD, or metals, like gold, specifically for this purpose?\n\n>Another reason why people would use Bitcoin over FIAT is there would be no need for a conversion rate as Bitcoin is Bitcoin all over the world I can easily buy something from India by sending the merchant Bitcoin and he can then spend his Bitcoin in india and vice versa if someone is buying something from me it's all the same.\n\nThere is a conversion. Currently, it is fiat to BTC for the consumer then back to fiat for the retailer. Even once everyone swaps to BTC, different \"conversation rates\" will still exist. Say a country with a weak currency converts all their fiat to BTC, obviously they will be unable to buy as much as say USA. This means the people in that country have less BTC. When there is less currency, things are priced less. When there is more currency, things are priced more. The concept is very similar to inflation. While everything will be priced in BTC, countries with more BTC will likely charge more for the same product, so a \"conversation rate\" between currencies would still exist.\n\nAlso, how is paying with fiat hard? Literally just type in your name, credit card number, and CVV and the payment is finished in a second (unlike BTC). Most retailers allow saving of name and credit card number too.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnother problem is how largely in-bedded fiat is in society: everything is priced in fiat, workers are payed in fiat, and most people have all their savings in fiat. Switching from fiat to BTC on a country-scale is a massive change, and for this to ever happen BTC must be significantly better than fiat for the average person. Also, correct me if I am wrong but are all BTC payments currently manual? If BTC were ever to become absurdly priced like 10000000 USD/BTC, would you not have to type out something tedious every time you transferred money, like 0.00000000252, manually?",
