Later in the day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink clarified rumors by stating that he doesn't see a huge demand for cryptocurrencies from clients,\n\nStill, BTC remained bid and closed (as per UTC) above the 20-day MA for the first time since May 20, validating the argument that a short-term bottom has been made at $5,755 (June 24 low).\n\nWhile a move above the 50-day MA is encouraging, it does not qualify as a bullish reversal.  Only a convincing break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.\n\nAt press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,720 on Bitfinex \u2013 up 5 percent in the last 24 hours \u2013 and the 50-day MA is located at $6,720.\n\nView\n\nBTC looks set to test $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline), albeit after a minor pullback as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought as per intraday technical studies.\n\nA close (as per UTC) above $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open up upside towards $7,920 (target as per the measured height method). That said, bulls would still need to observe caution as the area between $7,000-$7,100 is packed with stiff resistance lines.\n\nOn the downside, a close below 20-day MA of $6,448 would weaken the odds of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.",

Than it hits a point where fee gets too high and people sell. Miners what to exploit whoever they can. They are pissed we didn\u2019t increase the block size and they want the real bitcoin to die and Bcash to take over. \nSegwit is only 40% and Lightning\u2019s years away. This isn\u2019t the year AGAIN!!!  Listen, Wait for the price to go back to ATH and the fees explode. When fees go up, people sell. It\u2019s a top indicator. It got be 3x\u2019s as many Bitcoins by selling at $18 and buying more at $5900. It\u2019s gonna take years for segwit and Lightning. I don\u2019t understand what is holding it up maybe they are doing the same lol. \nThese cycles will make people like us rich but adoption so slow that they may switch to another alt which Andreas said will happen in his last talk. He said bitcoin won\u2019t be #1 so we just watch the price and fees and know exactly when to sell.  They are starting to think segwit and Lightning won\u2019t be 100% for another 4-7 years. I\u2019m older than the devs. No time to wait for that so I\u2019ll play the game with them. ",

That will take a new generation to become implemented though. \n\nImagine being raised in a digital culture, and deciding between a solid running blockchain network that uses mathematical accounting to digitally store your value on a ledger that is tamper proof, and provides perfect record keeping and a fixed supply ...to a metal with an unknown supply that is dig up from the ground only to be locked up in a vault and put back in the dark again. It's a no brainer. Gold was great before we evolved, but how incredibly closed minded would you have to be to not see the inevitable future. It's quite a ways off, but it's coming.",

If there are players large enough to manipulate the market, why pick today to do it? What's significant about it? Why wouldn't they manipulate the market at this scale more frequently? If they can drive up Bitcoin 10% overnight, why not do this once a week and really cash in? They know when to pump and when to dump, so there's no risk. So yeah, doesn't really make sense when you think about it...\n\nUnless you're trying to say that they wait months and months until the \"time is right\".",

When it comes down to it they do not like currencies that allow you to transact anonymously.  It\u2019s hypocritical of course cause *they* want them for themselves and their black ops, but not for the public. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen tomorrow or even in the next few years, but I do think it will happen and it worries me. They want to be able to track every dollar that every person spends in real time. \n\nAnd I\u2019m worried they could criminalize Bitcoin for \u201cnational security\u201d reasons. The indictments from Friday only referenced a single Bitcoin transaction in February 2016 for 0.026043 BTC or approximately $9 at the time. But they still pushed their agenda in the media with articles like\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/technology/bitcoin-russian-hacking.html\n\nAnd\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-13/bitcoin-was-russian-hackers-currency-of-choice-u-s-says\n\nI do not believe that is an accident. This may give them the ammunition they need to justify cracking down on Bitcoin due to issues of \u201cnational security\u201d. Of course they will overlook the fact that using Bitcoin actually *helped* them track down the hackers.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget the information in the indictment is also just allegations. There is no evidence or proof that this happened. That makes it even easier for them to manipulate the public sentiment to achieve their agenda. \n\nI really really really hope I am wrong. ",

To my puzzled question 'when' he replied half a year ago. When I claimed that they couldn't have mined jack's shit with any kind of a server even a year ago, he said they had GPUs. So I went on to explain that GPUs wouldn't mine jack's shit either to which he concluded that bitcoin is dead. He clearly did not mine anything (best case they were Nicehash kitties), but there was an incentive for him to claim as his experience what he heared from other people. At the same time, he thinks bitcoin is dead.\n\nGuy is overall smart and cool, which strikes me the most.  There must be many young and smart people running around that thinks bitcoin is absolutely amazing, but unfortunately, dead.",

If they own a \"hot wallet\" that buys/sells instantly on-site and the price they bought BTC at has lost $1000 in value, they've lost that money but obviously they can gain if a bull run is in effect over what they purchased it at.

            "Text": "10 years is a decent starting point for early adopters, but not nearly enough to expect any real mass adoption regardless of fees. Even though 10 years is not a lot of time, it allows Bitcoin in these early days to be tested under multiple load environments to flush out the flaws so they can be addressed.It's critical to understand that most people do not understand how the technology they use even works. With Bitcoin this will be especially true. Understand that you are an early adopter. Regardless of the fees, or transaction times, early adopters are already using or at least buying Bitcoin. The ONLY thing that will lead to widespread adoption is incentive. Currently that incentive is the potential to profit from a rising coin price, and personally I think that's a great start.\n\nBy the way, the internet was not invented in 93. The internet began with the tech in 1969 used by early adopters in a niche military use environment. During the first few decades, issues were found and fixed as they implemented protocols, packet switching, and a slew of improvements. It was YEARS and YEARS later that it finally found its way into mainstream use. I'm not trying to be nit picky, but my work requires me to be well versed in the history of many innovative technologies quite extensively. Also, please consider the process involved for contributing code to the open source community. Bitcoin is progressing extremely well, but the past 10 years is only a drop.",

Regular Bob or Alice does not. Countries like Malta, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Czech republic are forming communities around bitcoin already.  They have nothing to lose in global power distribution scheme. US, Russia, India, China, etc are in position where change is chaos and status quo is power. Want to see the front line of adoption? Look at arts, not banks or politics. Ask your local music producer, painter or a DJ.\n\nAlternative is, that everybody would have understood implication of bitcoin in 2009, and completely get that this is a new procotol for human interaction. Richest person would try to own it, which would be the end of bitcoin.",

HODL is a trading strategy? are you looking at everything through trading lenses? that is a major simplification.\n2. data is not a problem (before analysis). you see, each statistical analysis method requires certain type of data. some can only use cardinal data (price), while some data will be nominal by design (I don't know, country, wallet?, maybe address format). I brought up gender research because it's an easy example.\n\nFirst thing you do to your data in analysis is standardization (you have a variable of price, but for the statistical method you want to use you have to make a price a boolean value. So you introduce a threshold which did not exist in the data. You create a new variable called HasOneBTC, with values True for data points with value greater than 1BTC etc.) and conceptualization (you have to decide for your research what is bitcoin user - is trader a user? is holder a user? is there a threshold of btc owned to qualify? ). You remove data that does not qualify, because frankly, you said so. Also, you will never know if 1 bitcoin address belongs to multiple individuals, or multiple addresses belongs to 1 individual.\n\n3. because of this, you have to try to squeeze some analysis from data already available, not looking for data based on your hypothesis. what data do we have? a time series with price. that is pretty much it. you have to make a selective decission when looking for events to explain the move. now we have 1k USD sudden rise. Is that because of 1 thing?\n\n4. when you talk about bulls, you create a perception of wall street blazer kind of guy plotting against humanity. I am sure this is happening to some extent, but you absolutely have to disregard a possibility that the price has spiked because MANY small actors, because there is just no way to tell.\n\n5. at the end of the data analyis, you have made so many changes to your data that there is no way to go through that with a person you are presenting the analysis. might as well just share the results, implying it's what the original data said. but it's not.\n\n6. best tool to make money is money. rich people do not need analysis to decide, they need analysis to back the decision that was already made.",
