Everyone is treating bitcoin like some traditional market medium when everything it has done has defied conventional wisdom. There are so many players and international influences including whales, hodlers, shady exchanges, rampant speculation of government regulation and ETFs, wild predictions of mass adoption, angry reactions to losses. What a great time to be involved in this crap. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re all going to be alright. ",

Of course it's risky, otherwise everyone would do it and we'd already be over 50k per coin. \nThat's the point buy it during the risk period and the reward may be phenomenal. Because once the price catches up with the framework efforts currently underway, it will be all worth it.\nAll this BS controversy, yet so few people stop to grasp the opportunity of it. I'd there weren't pessimists and one dimensional perspectives, then there would be no fear of buying it. But because of that fear, it takes balls to buy and risk your hard earned money. But then one day the few risk takers have the last laugh ...and should be thanking all those FUD spreaders for the opportunity they provided us.",

The institutions don't have a huge incentive to do this at the moment, which is why it hasn't happened yet. \n\nBitcoin is way too volatile to function as a store of value or a coffee currency, and mass adoption won't help that volatility. Besides mass adoption requires a level of regulation that bitcoin was designed to be resistant to. \n\nBitcoin is working as it should, and designed against change.

My own opinion is that the current price is built on a house of cards, ... with Tethers and 90% of the trades are fake (wash trades) on the Chinese exchanges.  So if BTC is to be taken seriously as a long term investment vehicle, this house of cards must first come down (which invariably will result in price collapse).",
