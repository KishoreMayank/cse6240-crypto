I looked at Reddit Bitcoin for Beginners and no one has posted for months, and I was looking for active info. I would like to start taking BitCoin and other Cryptos. I run a website that does remote work for customers like removing viruses, server cleanup, and I have a PAYPAL icon on the site, and PAYPAL made it very easy. You can click on my hourly rate, and just add the numbers of hours you want, and its calculates the charge, and you use a credit card. Fees are super high, like 10&#37; from PayPal. I would like to setup an easy way for people to Pay in Bitcoins also, but am unsure how to start. Do i use Coinbase, or Bitpay? Seems like they pop up first when looking. Also, I want to be able to export the Bitcoins to a hard wallet, as everyone tells me thats the only way to go. In otherwords, at some point I want to cash out my coins and get USA cash, and hopefully do this anonymously, and be able to take the hard wallet \"thumb drive\" say to Athena and get cash immediately. They have ATMS here locally.  I don't want to have to deal with setup like Paypal with having to give them my bank account and so forth right now as I am just learning, and security is paramount.",

The price drops and all these obnoxious 'know-it-alls' come out if the wood work to compensate for their sorry lives, and get some pathetic pleasure out of telling crypto investors the whole \"I told you so\" verbal diarrhea.\n\nThen when Bitcoin runs back up to a new ath they magically disappear. But then they always come back again just to be grasp a tiny bit of artificial credibility when the price is dropping to pretend they have some greater sense of financial understanding than the rest of us. \n\nThey call crypto investors naive, greater fools and spew out the usual insults (because they lack the creativity to come up with anything new).

Past results do not indicate future performance.)  What always surprises me is that despite all the ideology being bantered about here, regarding BTC as a replacement currency, so many are complaining about how much fiat they have lost.  If BTC is just a fiat casino chip, then I'd suggest you stop gambling, when you can't afford to lose more.  Most wouldn't go to Vegas expecting to win millions, and holding Bitcoin until the next century may not see you making a dime.  What's so hard to understand? Think of Bitcoin as a stock that can go to zero value and you'll approach it with a totally different frame of mind.  Don't make it your golden calf.  It's not a religion.",

            "Text": "I think Bitcoin is like... electric cars. \n\n1. Everyone sits back and says 'yea, electric cars make sense'. But when it comes to their pocketbooks, they fall in line with everyone else.\n\n2. No matter what, you have to pay rent in FIAT, and to go from FIAT to BTC to go back to FIAT, and pay an exchange fee, is just stupid. It's an extra step. Plus, with my Citi\u00ae DoubleCash\u00ae rewards credit card, I get 2% back on all charges, which means, I actually make money from a financial institution for once. Sure the vendor pays the 3% on their end, however that's a part of doing business that will always be there. So the talk about banks being bad (which they are) doesn't affect people who are good with their budgeting, so there is zero incentive for me to ever switch to use bitcoin.\n\n3. The failure of Apple Pay/google pay/walmart pay/ every other pay. Capital one has Zellie, and I also have CashApp, and PayPal. Every fucking company has a pay product now. Bitcoin is just another one of those in my mind, except there is a conversion fee first, then the standard payment fee.\n\n4. Bitcoin technology will succeed, but bitcoin itself will not. It has zero value to any American financial institution. \n\n5. Everyone says 'but what about the dollar? but what about the eventual collapse?'.  If the US currency collapses, guess what? I still have to pay rent in US Fiat, which means, that EVERYONE in the USA will SELL their bitcoin to get FIAT as fast as they humanly can. This will cause a crash in bitcoin just as the global currencies also crash. As the global currencies crash too, nobody will take bitcoin, just as nobody took any credit/digital transactions here after Hurricane Sandy. If you aint got FIAT, don't come knocking. ",

I thought that the last run would make it to 7000 or at least 6800 before it fell short, so it is at least a slight weaker market than it even appears. Still wouldn't surprise me there was at least one more run towards 7000 before sinking.",

While its possible we test that, there are so many buyers down there it could cause a huge bounce.  Also, Bitcoin is very unpredictable in that you can use all the TA in the world, but event driven news would trump it.  There's been a lot of positive news lately, whether its segwit adoption, infrastructure, index tracking etc.  So IMO something really positive will happen at some point in the next 1-6 months that at the very least proves where the floor is",

Past results do not indicate future performance.)  What always surprises me is that despite all the ideology being bantered about here, regarding BTC as a replacement currency, so many are complaining about how much fiat they have lost.  If BTC is just a fiat casino chip, then I'd suggest you stop gambling, when you can't afford to lose more.  Most wouldn't go to Vegas expecting to win millions, and holding Bitcoin until the next century may not see you making a dime.  What's so hard to understand? Think of Bitcoin as a stock that can\ngo to zero value and you'll approach it with a totally different frame of mind.  Don't make it your golden calf.  It's not a religion.",

To act like it can only go up, or that HODLing is the only good strategy is foolish.\n\nPersonally, I am choosing to HODL, but i only invested what i could afford to lose.  Still, I know I have lost 60% of the money i put into BTC (I started in Nov 2017), and to tell the truth, I am not so sure that I'll ever get it back.\n\nRemember in late 2017, the ONLY opinions expressed were that BTC was going to the moon?  People who were exposed to the one way of thinking, and listened to it, lost a lot of money.  So, just one opinion being expressed has already proven itself to be a bad way of doing things.\n\nI know (for me personally) i want to hear all opinions and ALL points of view, not just the bad ones and not just the good ones.\n\nThat way I have the greatest opportunity to be fully informed.\n",

And if the one putting out the new cyber asset were powerful enough (such as Amazon or google, or even apple, etc) people could flock to the new \"googlecoin\" (or whatever), and abandon bitcoin.\n\nI mean, bitcoin will still be there, but its value will be minuscule compared to what it once was.\n\nI am still going to HODL, but that bitcoin will go up in value again (other than a few dead cat bounces) seems VERY unlikely in my personal opinion\n",

Hence, Bitcoin use case as MoE is successful and hasn't failed as you described. Bitcoin is never a method of payment but a MoE. LN is growing out in less than a year so you can't say that the tech as a retail payment method died either.\n\n",

But you stick like glue to your one dimensional view. I think the most bizarre part is that you just say the same thing in different words. You're not hearing us. Try to grasp one simple thing. IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY IT FAILED. It's not Apple pay, or any of those systems built on existing platforms. It's an entirely new platform.\nI could care less that you misunderstand, but anyone reading your comments will get a completely incorrect concept of how incredibly difficult things Lightning Network are to implement. If you're ignorant of how complex it is to add this layer on a new network model, and then tweak it under load, you should just stick to your silly comments of gloom and doom and how a crytpo ETF will bankrupt the country and all that to foolish tinfoil hat bullshit.\nSeriously, some people just have to be called out on their crap. You'll be nowhere to be found on here in 3 years or so when bitcoin is an option at every online checkout right along side Visa, Debt, and PayPal etc. You're a victim of your own stubborn complacency to learn and expand your understanding.
