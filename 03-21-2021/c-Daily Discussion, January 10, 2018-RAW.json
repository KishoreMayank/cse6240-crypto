It would still spend time in committee and have to be voted on at some point down the road IF it makes it out of committee. It's just like the US. There's a LOOOONG road between introducing a bill and making it a law. Most bills never make it. Many are introduced just to score political points or send a message. That's what this one is. They know they can't ban bitcoin but they want to send a message for everybody to cool it a bit. Also, I'm sure many SK politicians had their fingers on the BUY button when the price dropped.",

On occasion deposits take a bit longer than advertised, but it's nice that you can start buying right away (though you're limited to $500 a day). They have an interesting fee structure based on the volume of your trades, so take a look at that. Also, you can only buy BTC and ETH which may or may not be an issue for you. Like any other exchange, the site goes down from time to time. ",

BTC has long term staying power, probably moreso than any other coin. If you can weather these times, you're in a position to come out significantly in the green a few years down the road. Additionally, Bitcoin could change the world and that's cooler than any company stock, imo. Buy and HODL and believe in the tech.",

            "Text": "Liqudating your position is basically abandoning your bet at where the price will go.  \n\nSo if today the price of BTC is 15k and you have a futures contract saying it will go up to 17k by a certain date, you're betting it will go up 2k by the time the contract is due.  If the price falls to 12k suddenly, it now needs to recover 5k to make your 17k price.  You might think that's unlikely and pull out.  That's the big picture of what a liquidation means.\n\nWith shorts, you're betting the price goes down.  So when the price spikes up, people liquidate when they think the price is going to stay up (rather than just bounce back down in an hour).",

Nothing wrong per se in two techs fighting it out (just like the hundreds of other alts) to see which one rises to the top.\n\nThe problem is that the Bitcoin Cash folks don't draw the line on the tech.
