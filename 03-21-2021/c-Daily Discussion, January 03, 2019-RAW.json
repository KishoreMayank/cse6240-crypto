I made 0.0039175 BTC (~15 USD currently) last year which is more than I made when I had the paypal link up!  It's not a ton (I don't do it for the money) but it's really cool to see people support my work with crypto :D.",

            "Text": "Does anybody know anything about whitelisting on Coinbase? Basically, Coinbase encourages to enable whitelisting because it \u201chelps secure your funds by limiting cryptocurrency withdrawals to only the addresses you\u2019ve added to your address book.\u201d I know Coinbase has had this for at least a couple of months but this is the first time it prompted me to enable it. Surely, anybody who has Bitcoin on Coinbase will tell themselves...why not?...as soon as they see the \u201csecure\u201d buzzword. But, is my Bitcoin not as secure without whitelisting despite Coinbase claiming their security is top notch impenetrable? I haven\u2019t responded to this option but I suspect whitelisting is an unnecessary security layer that Coinbase creates so they can charge you when you want to withdraw your Bitcoin to an address outside of your address book?  If it isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it. And I think that\u2019s all Coinbase is doing...trying to find clever deceptive ways of trying to nab you for more fees. Any Coinbase experts familiar with this option, I would appreciate some insight.",

As long as you have this string written down in one or more safe places, you *should* be able to regenerate your private keys using \"Edge\" or another BIP32-compliant wallet. If Edge didn't require you to back up this word seed, then I suggest finding a different wallet. BRD (breadwallet) is a common wallet for iOS, but watch out for the shitcoins. \n\nIf you find that you are accumulating more bitcoin than you are comfortable with storing on a smartphone, I suggest checking out Ledger and/or Trezor hardware wallets for a little more peace of mind.",

            "Text": "Because it's a complicated math cycle that keeps you from going back and changing a block in the past without changing every single future block. Just a small explanation before I dive into how the blockchain works: Hashing is the procedure by which you take any data, put it through a mathematical algorithm and get a specific, much shorter code at the end of the algorithm that is unique. The key factor is that due to the nature of the mathematical algorithm you cannot take the hash and convert it back to the original data, because data was lost in the process to get to that code.\n\nNow here's a very simplified method of how that works. You have 5 blocks, each block containing multiple transactions and apart from Block 1 (the very first block), it will also contain the hash code of the previous block. After hashing each block gets the following hash codes.\n\nBlock 1 = 32\n\nBlock 2 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 1) = 23\n\nBlock 3 (which contains transaction and the hashcode of Block 2) = 54\n\nBlock 4 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 3) = 43\n\nBlock 5 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 4) = 91\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow say that I want to modify a transaction in Block 3 after Block 4 and 5 have already been created. I go and change a transaction in block 3 so it gives me more money but now when block 3 gets hashed, the hashcode is no longer 54, it's 71, because I changed data in that block. Fine and dandy but the problem is Block 4 (which has already been created) knows the hash of Block 3 to be 54, not 71. So for my hack to work I have to change that information in Block 4, which in turn generates a new hash for block 4 which doesn't match what's stored in Block 5. So now I also have to change Block 5, etc.\n\nAs such, you cannot modify a past block without having to modify all of the blocks that come after it. This wouldn't be a problem until you realise a hashcode is not a two digit number, but looks something like this \"0000000000000000001163964a1c98bc52766d24570a3651002f384851057ab1\" and we are not on block 5, but block 556834 at the time of writing.\n\nSo you're best bet would be to change a block that was created very recently, like maybe 2 blocks ago. This is where decentralized comes in. There are tens of thousands of computers that contain THE FULL blockchain. Each block, with each transaction and each hashcode, is replicated identically on all of these computers. So if you change just one, all the other computers will ignore it because it's most likely that you're trying to do something funny. So if you want to change a block in the history, besides having to change all the blocks that follow that block so the information is consistent, you also have to do it on 51% of the computers on which the blockchain is replicated AT THE SAME TIME so that the rest of the 49% of the computers believe your version of the blockchain.\n\nSo in essence, the truthful answer is YES it can be tempered with, but you need space-time bending technology to be able to actually do it.\n\nEDIT: UUuu, gold, shiny, thank you!\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Text": "That is a wee bit more complicated, but not by much. This is where wallet public and private keys, come in. I'll try and simplify again all the concepts to make it as clear as possible.\n\nLet's start with Private and Public Keys. This is a encryption (not hashing, encryption means I can obtain the original information from the result)  method that says you can only scramble a message with a specific code, and descramble it with a very different but just as specific code, but you couldn't do the reverse. The scrambling code is called the private key (because it's the key that you keep private, for yourself) and the descramble code is called the public key (that's what you give to the recipient, so they can decode your message and read it). Whoever gets a hold of your public key can read the messages you are sending, but they cannot alter and re-encode the message and then push it forward to pretend they are you, because only the private key that you have can encode the message in the correct way so that it can be read by someone with the public key. This is again, done through some very fancy maths.\n\nNow, back to bitcoin. When you set up a wallet you also tell the blockchain what your public key is, but not your private key, that's only for you to know. When you want to do a transaction with Bob, you're not physically giving the bitcoin to Bob, you're just making a request to the blockchain that you want x amount bitcoin to no longer be in your wallet, but be in Bob's wallet, and in order to Authenticate this request (basically to prove that it is you who made the request) you encrypt the request using the private key, which means the blockchain can decode it using the public key. This essentially means that if your request can be decoded correctly and read, it must be YOU who made the request and not some scummy individual.\n\nWell this prohibits someone from stealing your money, but what's there to stop them from creating two wallets and just saying \"I want 1 BTC to go from wallet X to wallet Y\" without having any money in wallet X. This is where the beauty of blockchain comes back into play. A wallet is always created with 0 Bitcoin in it because the amount of bitcoin in a wallet is determined by the transactions that it was involved in and nothing else, so in order for it to get bitcoin, it has to be received from another wallet that already has bitcoin in it. If I claim that I want to send 1 BTC from wallet X, the blockchain will be read back all the way to the Block when wallet X was created and determine if wallet X has more than 1 BTC in it by replaying all the transactions that it has been involved in since its creation. If the total value stored in it is more than or equal to 1BTC, then the transaction is valid, if not, transaction rejected GTFO.\n\nSo it's basically impossible to counterfeit bitcoin.\n\nThe only exception to the above is when a new bitcoin is created by a Miner as a result of mining. When miners mine, and a block is discovered that contains a reward, it automatically assigns that reward to a wallet when writing the new block (usually their own, because they like money :) but there have been instances in the past where someone goofed, didn't assign the newly found bitcoin to a correct address and that bitcoin was lost FOREVAAAAA). It still appears as a transaction in their wallet, but the source of the bitcoin will be a block instead of a different wallet. \n\nSo in short, you can't modify past blocks because it requires bending time and space, and you can't modify current blocks because it requires breaking into other people's wallets.\n\nCracking the private-public key encryption is... well there are some theories that it can be done with quantum super-computing but that's still to be proven and not everyone has access to a quantum super-computer, so your best bet is to beat the living shit out of someone until they give you their private key, or hack into a miner's computer so they send new bitcoin they mine to your wallet instead of their own.  \n",
