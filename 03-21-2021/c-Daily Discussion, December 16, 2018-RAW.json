Currently [btc.com](https://btc.com) is showing the latest block mined being 5 hours 08 minutes ago. This is definitely not true and is another scam by jihan, wanting to mislead people yet again.\n\nAt this moment the highest block mined is 7minutes ago, as shown in most bitcoin explorer sites (e.g. [https://www.blockchain.com/explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) and [https://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc) )\n\nIt's either a scam by jihan or bitmain is on the brink of bankruptcy that couldn't even maintain a block explorer site as suggested by many chineses in 8btc.",

That\u2019s all it really needs to do to have great value.....but there\u2019s also so much more. And 99% lol, most people are screwed on their credit cards who are u kidding.

I feel I have a good idea of how long it takes to integrate a new tech, but that isn't the issue here. What we're talking about is currency, and not a new payment platform for an existing currency. This means multiple generations at the very minimum. We are programmed to use fiat from a very early age. It's even how many children learn to count and manipulate numbers. Currency is something that is embedded into the very fabric of society and to think we can reshape it in 10 years is radical and irrational. It will take many years, as new generations become familiar with a new concept of currency at an early age. Even economists, as intelligent as they are, are programmed over years and their entire career to view money within the concept of fiat. Bitcoin does not align with their foundation of currency values and infrastructure. The economists of the future will see things differently.",

As I said in another comment, what we're talking about is currency, and not a new payment platform for an existing currency. This means multiple generations at the very minimum. We are programmed to use fiat from a very early age. It's even how many children learn to count and manipulate numbers. Currency is something that is embedded into the very fabric of society and to think we can reshape it in 10 years is radical and irrational. POS systems will slowly evolve and be reshaped over the years, just as have already been. Evolution is ongoing and never stops.",

So, it prints money. Debt Dollars that are not backed by anything other than people who share a belief in making America great. (no pun intended). So, they build infrastructure with debt dollars; they build weapons for debt dollars; they build homes and jails for debt dollars that can be traded for food. \n\nNow, if the country absolved fiat, how would it generate wealth to do things? They would have to print bonds backed by bitcoin; essentially a promise to pay. I can't see that happening. \n\nPlus, based on some algorithim, eventually ALL of bitcoin would get lost by paper wallets, glitches, or solar flares.",

You convert USD to YEN, but that value must always exist in one of those states, constantly tied to a specific region. Enter Bitcoin, a new state of money that is not tied to any region and you can leave as much of your wealth in this state for as long as you wish. That characteristic adds an entire new layer to the concept of currency. A new type of existence for wealth on a new infrastructure that opens endless doors. This especially benefits digital purchases made online where the seller and the buyer interact seamlessly with an ecosystem that does not recognize geographic boundaries. I can go on a long time regarding the multitide of advantages this  brings and there are far more that will be discovered along the way.",

            "Text": "I haven't weighed into any of these discussions in quite a while, but I read them for perspective and occasionally for amusement. You and I generally have been on the same wavelength, cryptogrip, and your conversations seem to fall into two basic categories. One (not this particular one) is where people single you out for juvenile name calling, and that's the side of Reddit that sickens me. The other, like this one, is a good, well-reasoned discussion, where from my perspective the other side simply cannot think outside of what is known today. However, if you look at any major sea-change in technology (or anything else, for that matter) if you were to take the new norm after adoption and turn back the clock 15 or 20 years, you generally would see a world in which that new norm not only wasn't used, but often couldn't be imagined. I think this mental inertia, for lack of a more descriptive term, is what you keep running up against in trying to make your point. As an example example, instead of Bitcoin and fiat/payment systems, suppose you were having this discussion in the 1890s with a buggy maker about the role air dominance would play in warfare in the immediate future when cars were still a novelty. I suspect the nature of such a discussion would have made those appearing on this sub look like a parody, yet look what happened. It's hard for most people to wrap their mind around something beyond what is currently known, and that steers their thinking. I see that over and over in Reddit comments here and in other subs. For what it's worth.",

            "Text": "Yes, people are allowed differing opinions. Let's take home automation. Two years ago, you could argue that home automation was the way of the future with NEST\u2122 and that in the future everyone would just use their phones to turn on and off lights. Clearly, that's not going to happen because people live in 100 year old houses and aren't about to spend all kinds of money to rewire anything. They also said in 1985 we would have flying cars by 2018. We can't even get self driving cars approved, let alone flying cars. \n\nNow, about Bitcoin, I like your concept of a borderless currency like gold. Basically, this is a digital form of gold as gold is borderless and we theoretically use gold as the standard globally. So we are converting from USD to Gold to Yen. Instead we convert from USD to bitcoin to Yen. In your argument, why don't we just have Bitcoin at both ends also, so there is no conversion? Sounds great right? Well we can't do that. Countries NEED fiat to exist. They need the ability to generate money for infrastructure and defense, and in order to do that they print fiat. If suddenly everyone hid their fiat, they would just print more. If everyone hid their bitcoin, countries, and the global economy, would collapse. This is what is really scary. \n\nNow, let's say you have both. This is what we have now, and it doesn't really work. Contracts are written 30 years out with banks, that they are to be paid in fiat for the mortgages. So, no matter what happens with bitcoin, people still need to use fiat for 30 years. So, knowing we will have fiat for 30 years, also means that there will need to also be government backed banks. Therefore people's payroll will most likely also need to be in fiat. Now, I don't know if you have any loans like student loans or car payments, but if 50% of your net income has to be paid in fiat, chances are you won't want to get paid in bitcoin and then pay a conversion fee to switch it over to USD to pay your loans. It will be a pain in the ass to do the extra step. \n\nAnyways, i am open to debate this further but I honestly feel that 'Bitcoiners' (those people with no concept of the real world) are waiving their magic harry potter wands thinking that little old ladies who still write checks are suddenly going to give up their fiat and pay with their iPhone 10s. There are so many layers to payments in the US at least, that fiat will never go away, and as long as fiat is the dominant coin of the realm for day to day stuff, that even if Bitcoin was dominant on the internet, and you can use either fiat or bitcoin, why take the extra step? Just use fiat because it's easier. \n\nRemember, no matter how amazing or great a system is you build, you always have to assume that it will be ruled or used by the lowest common denominator of people in terms of adoption and use.",
