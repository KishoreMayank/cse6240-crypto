Its like the community as a whole has decided to not think/talk about this because of how bad it is. Ignoring this won't make it go away. People need to change their investment/trading plans for 2018 immediately.\n\nChasing those green candles and trading several times a day is going to lead to you being taxed out of your fucking gains 5 years from now. Remember, Audits don't work the way the court of law does. You are guilty until proven innocent in an audit, and not being able to provide the documentation proving your paid up properly results in you losing by default.\n\nThis is how they plan to steal the wealth from the millenials that will get wealthy from early adopting. **Please pay closer attention.**",

I will say though that I have been buying and using Bitcoin since it was in the $200s and was used to sending relatively large sums of money quickly, and for pennies.\n\nI understand that now Bitcoin is more popular than ever and the mempool has more transactions that need to be processed and confirmed than ever, but in its current state it is just not usable. I know I'm not alone, but I have had a transaction pending for over a hour that now costs nearly 100x more than it used to cost to send, and takes much longer to get a single confirmation due to all of these factors.\n\nI am a firm believer in Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, and the value they have the potential to bring. That said, can someone ELI5 what is on the roadmap to help alleviate these issues as a I am not a developer/programmer?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: typo",

            "Text": "~Hello all.  \nIf you are in the USA, I would like to point out that now is a good time tax-wise to buy and hold BTC. By buying before Jan 1 2018, you can hold until Jan 1 2019 and avoid paying short-term capital gains taxes while also avoiding needing to settle up on those taxes until April 2020, when 2019 taxes are due. There is a lot of time for you do constructive things with that captured value potentially in that time.  \n  \nAlso, we should see Lightning Network (LN) on BTC mainnet by then, which should be very bullish for prices as the coin will have a greatly increased utility. I'd also imagine we will either have or be on the precipice of atomic swaps by that time. Big things to be excited about, for sure...\n  \nJust food for thought though- good luck with your holdings, health and wealth in the new year :-)",

I think we can all agree, that we believe in the idea of cryptocurrency and all of us know that the blockchain technology itself will only get more popular and successful in the future. \nThe value of bitcoin in my opinion depends massively on how it's being perceived in the public eye and therefor on how it's being portrayed by the media on a daily basis. This will either make people buy or sell (or not even get in). And in my opinion there has been a shift recently from \"it's risky and speculative and you can loose money as fast as you can make some\" to \"it's super dangerous, pure evil and nobody should invest in it\".\n\nMy question to all of you out there who are serious about investing in bitcoin is: \nWhere do you see potential in early 2018 for this public opinion to change and as a result cause bitcoin to rise again and not plummet?\nOr do you think I am overestimating the impact media has no the price of bitcoin?

I love technology. through its all ups and downs , it will emerge and the mainstream cannot help but change themselves to match it ,integrate it.

People will lose so much money on BTC to those cashing-out early, that crypto will have a bad reputation for a long while.  So, when a crypto comes along that is actually viable, it will be undervalued  as people will be very suspicious of it.  So you will have a lot of time to get on board.  Of course, you will need to identify a viable coin first.  One that is easy to use, anonymous, scalable, secure from hacking, impervious to QC, etc.  Maybe such a coin already exists.  There are over a thousand to chose from, maybe one of them is viable.  If not, don't fret, they'll make more. ",

L-I-V-I-N (or trying to) in the fasco-communist U.S.S.A still, if that means anything, without a VPN/proxy at the moment.\n\n2: What is a good VPN/proxy combo, if needed?

Had a friend who was into this stuff and saw some markets and other functions of such years ago but haven't seen or spoken to that person in almost two years. Read a redit post or two dated from years ago about ripping out hard drives and finding a LinuxOS computer and using other wi-fis and opening browsers while not connected to the internet, is any of this still necessary or have there been improvements since? Eli5 this semi-newb longtime lurker.\n\n3: What are/is a good hard cryptocurrency wallet(s)? (For ex: Trezr vs. Ledgr vs. others) Not all coins this user is interested in are currently shown to be covered by either of these two main wallets, so if they are added later, will it be through a patch via software or will this user need to buy a new hard wallet (trying to avoid planned obsolescence here)?

Not that it's unheard of since etrade sends out a statement and a spreadsheet of trades.  You make money you pay your taxes. Hold it a year it's taxed at capital gains tax, I think about 15%, daytrading/swingtrading taxed at regular income rate in US. Every Trader in the US complies and the IRS is sent a copy to match with your return.  If you're gonna trade, yes you pay your tax bracket on how much you made.  Hodl over a year and its capital gains.  And if you have losses in the market you can offset your gains with them.  Just life.",

            "Text": "I personally think it\u2019s highly likely that BTC will continue to climb throughout 2018 and beyond. There\u2019s still far too much excitement for people to drop out now. That being said, there are many people at this stage who are extremely rich through their BTC assets. These are people who have a strong incentive to actualise that profit by transferring it all into fiat. Therefore, as the price of BTC gets higher, the excitement grows, but the desire for large players to \u201ccash out\u201d in times of price decline also grows. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s going to get even more volatile than it has already been. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if it actually did crash pretty low at one point, but I find it unlikely that it wouldn\u2019t recover. This is simply because of the number of people who would see the low price as a massive opportunity to get in on the action in a way they never could have before. As for those who just HODL HODL HODL, I don\u2019t see why they aren\u2019t willing to sell and rebuy at a lower price.",

Look, Bitcoin is the honey badger, it don't give a fuck. Yeah, if you bought some at 19k, it sucks ass for you right now. You may never get it back.\n\nI would (and have) bet a decent chunk of change that Bitcoin is a world changing technology and social phenomenon, and it's going to succeed no matter how many people talk shit about it. I think anyone saying otherwise needs to take into account that their arguments are (mostly) quite old, have been done to death, and so far, have been proven wrong.\n\nEdit: for a little perspective, how long did it take from WebVan starting and then imploding with the other dotcoms, to Amazon Fresh?",

Wall St. ain't stupid enough to hold a widely volatile instrument as bitcoin that has almost no liquidity. ",

This brought an influx of money and inflated the value even more. \n\nWhen these people realised this is a very shady business, with an ageing technology that is practically worthless with its high fees, slow speeds and so on they became disappointed and cashed out.. and continue to do so.. it did not help that during this exodus rocket man Kim hacked an exchange in Korea, the government of Korea put bitcoin and regulation in the same sentence and BTH joined coinbase etc. All this added to the confusion and the doubt.",

A lot of people who have hodl'd are just escaping on the upturn at the moment. Wait until the true hodlers remain - the value will flat line. Then when those hodlers begin buying again, it'll slowly rise. Then the speculators come in droves. Then boom. And repeat. Each time, a number of speculators will be coverted to hodlers, so the long term trend is upwards, but you need to be really patient for the long game.",

No taxing happened until you cashed out to USD, At which point you just look at the profit and tax a percentage of it. Easy peasy.... Now every trade you do, crypto to crypto even is taxed, and you have to track the dollar values at the times of each trade to prove whether you profited on that tiny change and pay taxes on each individual one throughout the year. That could easily be thousands or more per year for active traders. And it'll all be short term tax rate (which is higher).\n\nThis makes buying and holding hilariously more profitable (albeit boring) because the fewer trades, the less your tax burden. The real kicker though is when audited, if you cant provide $ values at the time of each trade you ever made, then you can fail to prove your innocence or that you don't owe, which would cause you to \"lose\" your audit and be penalized further which is just bullshit.",

They seem to lock up and kill rallies (just due to system load I think). They also are perceived as dragging their feet on segwit, either due to technical challenges (most likely) or some conspiratorial alliance with bcash (less likely IMO).\n\nThey have had some days recently where withdrawals were severely delayed, too. Nobody likes the feeling that all their money is in limbo.\n\nI tell you what though, they sure beat Mt.Gox!",

With audits its your responsibility to prove your innocence instead of their responsibility to prove wrongdoing. So you will have to produce records of every coin to coin and coin to usd trade made for that year, Plus the USD values of all the coins at the time of those trades to prove you didnt fudge the numbers. Failing to prove you didnt fudge the numbers makes you \"guilty\".\n\nCurrently they are figuring out who to audit by grabbing the peoples names from subpoenas to the fiat onramps like Coinbase, and soon from U.S. licensed exchanges like Bittrex. They can also just randomly audit you if you cash out lots of money at some point and cant account for where it came from.\n",

It takes a special kind of person to come to a BTC forum and talk shit about BTC.\n\nIt's usually 1) someone hoping they can get more people to buy the shitcoin alt they just loaded up on or 2) the kind of people that just want to watch the world burn ",

If all gets broken or missing at the same time you can buy a new one and regenerate that with your seed.\n\nThat seed has to be stored somewhere as well. In a encrypted rar-file on a multiple USB-sticks, memory-cards or even on a offline PC.\n\nThe upside with using a HW-wallet imo instead of a paper-wallet is the ease of use. If I want to send coins to someone or pay for something I just plug it in and verify the transaction. physically on the ledger. No need to find the rar-file and decrypt it, copy the seed and open a wallet online.",

The buy wall has rised more and it's still producing a huge green cloud. Back in August there was a red cloud, which would have caused alarm bells to sound since the long term tendency was downwards, yet 5 months later the coin has tripled in value.\n\nWhat it means is we're not yet as bad as when the coin dropped from 3000 to 1750 in a month (that's a trend), since we're in a upward trend in general. \n\nSo the worst case scenario is it stabilizes at 12700, but it seems we'll go at least 15k, and once there up since the cloud is green.",

If using bitcoin as a means of payment were to have gained popularity the price would have steadily climbed. Instead what has happened is a small fraction of bitcoin holders see it as a currency and the majority see it as a valuable asset that they wouldn\u2019t dream of spending because they see the potential for more long term price increase. \n\nThe price is not what it is because there are many people using it. The price is what it is because there are many people buying it purely for the belief that the price will climb higher and they can cash out one day. \n\nThis is not a failure of bitcoin as a currency. It is still being slowly adopted as a currency. It is however a sign the the true value it has as a currency at present is overshadowed by a much larger value produced by speculative trading. That creates the potential for a \u201ccrash\u201d in price to occur one day. ",
