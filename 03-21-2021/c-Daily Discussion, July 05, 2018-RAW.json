It was a fad to him and his mates I have no doubt most of them don\u2019t bother with it anymore like the rest of the GP.

I used to believe it was going to get bigger but that was only with mainstream backing and that\u2019s come and gone imo. \n\nThe problem was they didn\u2019t believe in a future with it.

            "Text": "This may sound ignorant, but listen. There are a little over 2 million BTC remaining to be mined at an ever increasing difficulty. Mining costs may begin to dictate a static value, which would be a good thing. BTC lacks fungibility. Advanced miners may be the new arena of the fight to grab the reamining untapped wealth which could exceed 100k BTC before its done. DPW is in a precarious position trying to bring the USA into this fight. After announcing its next generation miner crypto tanked and the stock began to receive an onslaught of shorts, trolls and rumors. This leads me to believe that BTC price is still in its infancy if you can believe that. Tech stocks blow up on the rumor of the CEO having a good morning bowel movement. This onslaught of shorts is costing someone big. DPW still looks good to break out tomorrow. I bought in but the odds are on the monopoly I fear.",

Merchant adoption is decreasing. LN is a far off dream. Bitcoin's only use is people gambling on the price. And even that gamble is going to get boring with more sideways or slowly decreasing price action.\n\nIf you're looking to gamble, why not signup for robinhood and try options? It's way easier to gain or lose 100&#37; overnight. :P",

            "Text": "Fundstrat\u2019s Thomas Lee has lowered his Bitcoin price forecast for this year to $22,000 from $25,000.\n\nIn making his case the co-founder and managing partner of Fundstrat argued that the price of Bitcoin should be double that of the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s mining costs. With the mining cost of Bitcoin currently at US$9,100 according to Lee, doubling this cost while including other variables should see the price of the cryptocurrency reaching US$22,000 before the end of 2018.\n\nCost of Production\nLee went on to argue that the Bitcoin Price to Mining Breakeven cost (P/BE) cost metric was currently lower than 1 and miners thus needed to boost the price in order to operate profitably. He was speaking during the 2018 Asia Blockchain Summit held in Taipei, Taiwan where he was one of the guests.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BlockNewsKorea/status/1011852665951670273\n\nReferring to the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) which he created and unveiled this year, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors said that Bitcoin had already reached a bottom. According to Lee, the BMI\u2019s current reading is less than 30 and this is a bullish signal since the closer the index is to zero the stronger the suggestion for investors to buy.\n\nPer Lee, some of the reasons why the price of Bitcoin is still way below the record high it hit last year include regulatory uncertainty. He also suggested that Bitcoin was being hurt by futures contracts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Harsh Winter\nLee also noted that the bearish sentiment this year was more severe than the one of 2014. Four years ago it took around 300 days for the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap to fall by over 70%. This year, however, a similar drop occurred in a period of 200 days.\n\nLee first predicted that Bitcoin would hit a price of US$25,000 by year-end earlier this year in April.\n\n\u201cWe still feel pretty confident bitcoin is a great risk/reward, and we think it can reach $25,000 by the end of the year,\u201d CCN reported Lee as having said in a television interview.\n\nOnly time will tell if Lee\u2019s latest Bitcoin price prediction will come true. During this year\u2019s Consensus conference, which was held two months ago in New York, Fundstrat\u2019s managing partner had predicted that there would be a rally in the cryptocurrency markets. However, the price of Bitcoin actually fell while the total cryptocurrency market value dipped by more than $40 billion during the event.\n\nDespite the disappointment, Lee still stuck by his forecast of Bitcoin reaching US$25,000 by year-end. Until now.",

This is a longterm game.\n\n Bitcoin is the invention of decentralized trust an invention that has never existed in the history of the world, and has world changing implications, calling it a fad to GP is pretty short sighted and why does it matter if they do? My parents thought internet shopping was a fad. Cellphones were fads etc. Doesnt matter they will all be forced to use it eventually.\n\nYour brother is trying to help you out. If you can't be patient to hold longterm sounds like you invested too much or know nothing about the tech behind Bitcoin or both. Why invest in something you have 0 knowledge about? \n\nOnly invest what you are willing to lose it may take 10 - 20 years to reach full mass scale adoption of blockchsin tech or it could take much less. At least your bro has the foresight to see this tech isnt going away and despite what is going on now you are an early adopter. \n\n",

Bitcoin can't be banned. Any two people can install open source software and connect to the internet, the US government would never know. You can't confiscate bitcoin like gold because bitcoin isn't physical. This is so obvious it shouldn't need to be said. ",

You can't take the decentralization out of a blockchain and keep it secure. Blockchains are inherently vulnerable to 51% attacks and any centralization increases the risk of a successful  attack.\n\nA permissioned Blockchain is not secure and no one has figured out how to incentivise security or deployed a working example of one yet just discussions. Bitcoin will be the backbone that all blockchains run off of as its the only truly decentralized offering and inherently secure. It's valuable because it has value period. People are willing to pay for them they are extremely scarce, as  well as the numerous use cases many of which haven't even been explored or invented yet.\n\n\nTLDR: it's ridiculous to say that the Blockchain has value and Bitcoin doesn't. A blockchain without Bitcoin or comparable token is not secure. It is just a fancy database.",

It's ridiculous to praise the Blockchain and then say bitcoin has no use case other than being traded.....\n\nu/Polycephal_Lee \nsays it well:\n\n\"The blockchain is just an append only, tamper evident database. We've had those forever. The magic of bitcoin is nakamoto consensus, the solution to the byzantine generals problem that uses a network native token to incentivize proof of work. Banks don't need proof of work, they have authority. So they glom on to the only component of bitcoin they could possibly use, a database.\"\n\nBlockchain is also more than just a tamper evident database its a worldwide distributed one which only became recently possible due to the computing advances of the last 10 years. This is world changing tech  and Bitcoin is THE token. You don't need another token. Just wait and watch it unravel.",

All markets are manipulated on some level.

It's really difficult to nail how Bitcoin translates to value when it's a brand new monster. It can revolutionize how funds are exchanged gloabally and at the same time be traded on the market and eventually reach the potential of an exceptionally robust store of value as digital gold. It generates revenue for miners and hardware manufacturers. It's on it's way to becoming a massive industry of sorts, yet nobody knows how to value it. That's the truth of it. But just because I said it would be as sound to own as Amazon, doesn't mean it's evaluated in the same way. I mean, it's currency in itself. It could become a much bigger deal than most people envision.",

Don't get me wrong - I understand it has value for the things that you mentioned.\n\nThe main obstacle in my thought process is the linkage between the price of BTC, the value (as a currency) that it delivers and the underlying cost.\n\nTake Gold as an example.  1oz of Gold is the same whether it's priced at $100 or $1,000.  If used as a media of exchange, it will work regardless of price.  Just like BTC, if demand price falls below mining cost, mining operations will either self-adjust or cease.  But just as Gold price won't increase because of increased mining cost, neither will BTC.  \n\nSo .... I have really no fucking idea what BTC is worth.",

You are limiting your vision of the enormous value Bitcoin has and more importantly, will have. The digital value is there, it's not a physical bar of gold dug up from the ground only to put back in vault, no. But that's old school and this type of technology did not exist then. \nYou can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that Bitcoin does not need to be a company or a physical hunk of metal to have great value and that's unfortunate. You're using the traditional concept of stored value, because yes back in the day the gold standard meant that money was actually backed by gold. And this is something we could talk about all day.\nI like gold, but things can change, and no it won't happen overnight. But if Bitcoin's price stabilizes, it could very easily become an efficient store of value, particularly for a digital generation. It has the scarcity and security. It's also backed by the hashing power of a very complex and distributed global network. New protocols are in the works to address the potential of a 51% attack, and as we move forward many additional innovations will be compounded into the equation. Give it time.",

Every other coin has a founder or a company that created their coin and they have the most influence over the coin. A hard fork (a backwards incompatible change) that\u2019s forced on the user, for example, is an indication that the coin is pretty centralized.\"",

If you do the math (as has been done in countless other posts) and account for lost coins , there are only around 2-10 million people on earth who will ever own 1 Bitcoin or more.

They HAVE been using databases and now want to move onto blockchain tech which is basically a \"new\" kind of distributed database. Any blockchain they set up and control will be centralized by nature of it being created and owned by UPS. \n\n\nA centralized blockchain will not be secure with the current vulnerabilities to this tech. They very well may be doing what MSFT is doing with their Identity platform and implementing Bitcoins blockchain as it is the first, largest, most secure and ONLY worldwide distributed blockchain on the planet. \n\nAll these alt coins and 3rd party blockchains are all in the same bucket despite use case. They are created and owned by companies and individuals and thusly are centralized and have not solved the issue of security that Bitcoin has.  That's why MSFT identity platform is implementing Bitcoins actual blockchain as well as others as stated by their head of Identity, dude understands the importance of decentralization in the whole scheme of things which is what you are completely missing.  \n\nI think you came into this thinking that blockchains are inherently decentralized or something that can be chosen which is not the case. Bitcoin is the only decentralized blockchain and crypto due to how it was invented and released open source after the inventor disappeared and went anonymous. It has no owner no single point of failure is the first and thus largest distributed blockchain that has grown and survived from being released in Open source in 2009 to the beast it is today because it is decentralized. \n\nNo other blockchain unless it is decentralized or widely as distributed will be able to supplant or equal Bitcoin REGARDLESS OF USE CASE. If they want to widely distribute that data they will need to solve the issues that currently don't affect Bitcoin because of its decentralized nature or just implement the already existing worldwide decentralized chain. UPS can't just figure out the decentralization and incentive system it doesn't work like that. ",

It is an industry wide implementation cutting across the entire logistics value chain.  And it will be decentralised because the processing nodes will be spread across the many companies involved in the logistics chain.",

            "Text": "I don't think they are all related. I understand that you are talking about BiTA and their proposed centralized transporting and shipping blockchain deployment. Is security and 51% attacks something they magically wont have to account for? They are in pre discussion about this no solid implementation of how this is going to work. Distributing nodes evenly across participating companies sounds like like centralization to me. Easier for a hacker or attacker to consolidate nodes and initiate a 51% attack. You think all of participating companies will follow all the exact stringent security protocols? Im interested in how this implementation works out or what they come up with but Blockchains aren't inherently secure like everyone has said. Would be a shame if a hacker was able to get control of enough companies/nodes to alter the data. You telling me that with current security protocols and attitudes to security this is something they will be able to prevent? Decentralization is the key that is why I keep going back to BTC maybe i'm just nuts.",

What I understand is that they are trying to reach a consensus by limiting the among of hashpower that each group of stakeholders can have.
