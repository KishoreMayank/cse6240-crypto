We have an interesting conversation about the Fed, banks and the gold standard.  He agrees that it is an apparatus to keep the rich rich and the rest of us poor, hidden actors, Nixon, fractional-reserves, etc. \n\nMention Bitcoin, his response \"Fuck bitcoin.  Is it down?\"\n\n\"Well yes since last year about 60% but overall ---\"\n\nGet cut off, \"Good!\" and he goes back in his office.\n\nConfused I went and did some more work but had to go back to find out.\n\n\"Do you like or dislike Bitcoin?\"\n\n\"I hate it.  People treat it like a get rich quick scheme.  I have a client that put in $10k in December against my advice.  I'm a conservative investor.\"\n\nAh ha, ok can't argue with that.  What's interesting to me is that this guy is fully aware that the dollar is a non-backed currency controlled by a private company and enforced by the US military but is still selling it as his job.  Seeing what we are up against in person was sobering.",
