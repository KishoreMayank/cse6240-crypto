On December 12th I sent some bitcoin from my blockchain.info wallet to my electrum wallet with an extremely low fee of 20sat/KB (bad idea). The coins have been stuck in limbo since and it was to my understanding that it would either be eventually picked up or rejected by the blockchain within ~2 weeks.\n\nWell it's been just over 3 weeks now and the coins are still unconfirmed and haven't been returned to either of my wallets... So I was just wondering what my options were. I'm not in a huge rush for them, I just want to know they are safe and I didn't mess anything up (which is why I wanted to move them from blockchain.info to begin with).\n\nThe TX id:\n\n---*edited*\n\nUPDATE: After messing around with things for a while, I ended up importing my blockchain.info seed into an Electrum wallet and tried to resend the funds through there... AND IT WORKED! As soon as I tried sending the funds from Electrum I got an two emails from blockchain.info letting me know my tx failed and that my funds were returned to me. Hurrah!",

Further, if they sold the BCH to buy BTC in 2017, that's short term capital gains. If you later attempt to sell you BTC for usd and transfer those USD to your bank, you'll have to show that you paid this tax, as well as your original cost basis so that you can pay the remaining tax due. This is true even if your BTC are in a hardware wallet and you only ever used an exchange to exchange your BCH  for BTC without ever using your name. The problem will be cashing out to fiat when it's time to do so, and having a tax record to show. This is my understanding, as a non-tax professional. ",

That day is when korean gov announced to make FUD and it worked (cause noob - who started bitcoin after seeing 10k - didn\u2019t experinced drop & surge of bitcoin so they oversold their bitcoin)\n\nBut now situation is different. Even korean noob witnessed rebound of bitcoin price. Now korean gov\u2019s FUD strategy doesn\u2019t work well. FUD time is shorter than before and FUD price is higher than before. \n\nKorean gov is loosing control now. ",

At no point recently has ethereum been even close to as #completely fucked\" as bitcoin has been.\n\nI agree that ethereum can get congested, however \"congested\" for ethereum is something that bitcoin can only dream of.\n\nI am not sure why you think ethereum is fucked: I did a transfer today that went through in minutes and was less than a dollar. \n\nI understand you are probably invested in bitcoin and therefore very emotional: I can read it in your tone.
