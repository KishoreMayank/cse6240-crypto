            "Text": "Another heads up folks: \n\nEma12 is nearing passage above the ema26 line on the cb pro ** 1 DAY** chart.  This frequently indicates the price should continue to rise for a period after a clear crossing is observed.  By the looks of the chart at this moment, we are within a day or two of this event (my best guess). With the rapidity of our current ascent - target anytime this weekend. \n\nStrong resistance ahead though, so do your own research.  Also, due to the small size of this market, there is always a great risk that a random bear-whale could drop the price again at any moment.\n\nEdit:   15 hour update:  that bear rejection of 6800 has sent us back in the 6600\u2019s.  This means it is still possible for the ema12 to cross the ema26, but it it will take longer.  Unless we get some nice bullish momentum over the next day or so, new rough target for the crossing is early next week.   If bears can push price below $6600 and keep it there, then lines will not cross and my prognosis will turn bearish for the week ahead. ",
