Please for the love of the crypto gods, comment also based on what. Otherwise we will automatically assume you pulled out of your ass. \nNot judging, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s valuable info and it\u2019s rather distracting. \n\nSo here\u2019s my prediction. \nEven though cryptos were around for a long time now, the world is only catching up now. If you go on the street and ask a random somebody 50% chance they will say it\u2019s witchcraft. And this is why it\u2019s important to talk about it. \nSo the more and more ppl will understand it and regulations by governments are settled the price will become more stable. \n\nThe us congress had s debate on valentines day. If the crypto world world truly are in danger of crashing, then why would their defence department invest in upgrading their systems to support cryptos on quantum computers. \nNot to mention all the miners who destroyed the VGA market and made it very Very hard to buy a gtx 1080 Ti. Now they are probably part of the resistance since they have hardware investments in it as well. \n\nThe banks hate it probably, since it can hurt their business so I am expecting a lot of media fear mongering. \n\nAlso don\u2019t forget \nKoreas: \u201cwe will ban bitcoin\u201d\n*Korea buys bitcoin*\nKorea: \u201cOh, we won\u2019t ban bitcoin after all.\u201d\n\nStill read the news politics and tech. But know who controls them. \n\nPlease share your opinion. I don\u2019t mind if being told I am wrong, quite the contrary I love a healthy debate. \n",

            "Text": "Most of these bounces are fairly weak. Especially for newcomers, I think it is a bit improper to advice them to buy until we have reached solid bottom of this steep stair fall. 8.5k might be solid floor with proper bounce, though it might also go as low as 8k. This is just my opinion, but considering the candlesticks and the drop volumes lately, I'd say that this drop isn't over yet, contrasted with the lower buy volumes. We'll go back up after the drop I am sure, but this is not the best time to buy. It's always hard to catch the perfect bottom, but I'd wait a bit with buying. There will always be a limit to a fall; when people find the price too good to resist buying. The positive aspect is that after a drop, where the currency is considered undervalued enough by the market to warrant a strong buy volume, there will be a healthy rebound.",

            "Text": "I think it will prove to be very good in long term. Imagine a situation where all 21 million Bitcoin have been mined and there is a certain wealth distribution where there is hige inequality of course, and everybody is HODLing. Then essentially Bitcoin is not usable at all and the price will be absolutely stagnant. Things will be much better and healthy if there is huge liquidity in exchanges, real life use cases as a global decentralised transactional currency and of course if the wealth distribution is somewhat uniform. All of these can only happen if these early adopters/whales sell their Bitcoin and we small fishes eat them. Remember, in a ecosystem if there is nothing to eat for small fishes then entire thing falls! I'll be absolutely happy if all those early whales panic sell their holding over night today. Bitcoin may go to zero in that case. But we will all rise in a big way once after that happens. What do you guys think?",

            "Text": "HODL case made :-) although selling a % of BTC owned when significant drops happen to accumulate more BTC perhaps the way to go. BTC is the only crypto I want more of, other top 10 coins may also have some real world use cases, imo BTC is digital gold and cannot see this changing. IMO good times ahead for BTC in 2018 and beyond with a growing market dominance and Lightning network. All we need is true volume, less FUD, sensible regulation and perhaps institutional funds or good old FOMO can take us to the moon.",

I know it sucks to hear but BTC could very easily slide back down to those levels and test $6k. \n\nThere's support @ $8k but really with the sell volumes we've been seeing I don't know if $8k would hold for long should we revisit those levels.

Use some new money to buy in low and when it goes up high you can at least balance out your money or even make some in the process.\n\nAs long as prices go up and down you have chances of making money.

            "Text": "Btc is purely supply and demand. That is what regulate where the price will top at any given time. The more people learning about it and want to own some, the higher the price will go. There is limited supply, so if millions more people want some the price will go up even more. Pump and dump will do it short term and fud will make it drop but it will always go back to supply and demand level. Lets make more people aware and the price will just get higher and higher. For instance in South Africa you are not allowed to own gold or trade forex without a license only banks get. Big market for people that want to trade BTC since government cant stop us.",

You can't compare cryptos to the modern US stock market because there's no PPT for cryptos. If the fear really hits, there won't be any Fed to come save you.\n\nI realize after trying to trade this using the usual indicators and losing at that, that I have no ability to predict what this market is going to do, either short or long term, but I sure as hell don't rule out the possibility that it could tank.

Perhaps we'll see some sideways trading for a while until the market decides.\n\nYeah, the general fear of crashes since early February probably is a factor. Another factor is that many people already have bought decent dips. I think it's a smart move to just wait a bit and see where trends are going from here. Miners probably want it up to 10k soon so they are reluctant to sell too low, but the market is a bit shaken at the moment it appears. It should recover soon enough though within the coming weeks.",

Bull market or bear over the next several weeks?  HOLDing May make less sense.  Strategic switching may make more sense.\n\nDay trading?  See that knife?!  Drop it like it\u2019s hot!

He said in quotes after I sent him an article \"the first link about the new zealand banks pulling support for nzdt i don't think affects us too much.  the topics on reddit don't influence me much- i see fear / panic / blame- for example, ETN was having trouble everywhere, cryptopia or any exchange couldn't be blamed for that.  The tons and tons of people having issues with support tickets not getting answered after 3 days - they aren't paying attention to reality.  Cryptopia was an excellent exchange.  Because of their excellence they are now having tons of problems because their popularity boomed faster than they could scale up.  so the 90% of new people experiencing the issues their collective herd have impacted the website / server / customer service with are forced to form negative opinions.  Its like a million cats being pushed into a shoebox, they are all going to get scratched and angry lol\" \n\nyea they need a MUCH bigger team\n\nI mean if they need help. Why don't they hire help\n\nthey are hiring, but you see, the crypto-space is a trustless system.  its too easy to invite someone with decent reputation only to  have that person reveal their true nature later on by robbing everyone.  hiring is slow, because trust must be established.  They have some of the best talent in the world, but finding reliable people who won't cheat, hack or steal is a problem.  many programmers see themselves as Gods above the law, I'm finally watching Mr. Robot so i'm really understanding the gravity of security flaws.  People simply can't be trusted like they used to back when the protestant work-ethic was more important than the get rich quick at everyone else's expense culture...",

So why is that? Wouldn't such an advice make no sense, or better, wouldn't such an advice be outright wrong, if there was no real danger of total loss? And I mean total loss, not just having to wait ten years for some profits to return.\n\nI hope the best for bitcoin, I think it's awesome. But I do not discard the risk that bitcoin, or blockchain as a whole might not succeed.\n\n",

            "Text": "I don\u2019t get the issue with people using young accounts. Most people browsing reddit are usually very passive on it. They use it to view content and don\u2019t really contribute. Occasionally people read something which makes them want to contribute and it\u2019s often a lot easier to create a new account rather than to try to remember what the account they used very briefly 6 months ago was called. I personally also don\u2019t like the idea of there being one place where you can see everything I\u2019ve ever said on social media. This is why I personally have made about 7 or 8 accounts in the 7 years I\u2019ve been on reddit. \n\nI guess you have to ask yourself what\u2019s more likely: a handful of bitcoin millionaires spend their days making new reddit accounts trying to encourage small time holders to sell so that they can buy more bitcoin cheaper, or a handful of people with an interest in economics are fascinated by what is happening in this market, but find it difficult to hold their tongue when they see misinformed people putting in significant portions of their income into a system which they believe out of faith and desperation will skyrocket in price over the next few years.\n\nIf the former is true, why wouldn\u2019t these bitcoin millionaires just create dozens of new accounts each every day and spam the subreddit until 99% of all comments are negative rather than just create on account every few weeks and right a couple of negative messages?\n\nPeople post negative messages about bitcoin, because from an independent outsider\u2019s perspective who has a basic knowledge of economics, this subreddit makes bitcoin look like a cross between a pyramid scheme and a religion.\n\nFor bitcoin to be a success, vendors need to start accepting it and employers need to start paying it. This won\u2019t happen until volatility drops right down which won\u2019t happen until speculative traders lose interest",
