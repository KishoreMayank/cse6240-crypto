And wondering what people's thoughts are on the issue of global power use mining btc. \n\n> The most advanced bitcoin miners now expend 0.3 watts per billion hash calculations, or \u201cgigahashes.\u201d Flip that math around and you get 300 Gh per second per kilowatt. So the sketch is basically 13,600 petahashes per second with 234 kWh consumed by every transaction, giving you 32.71 terawatt-hours consumed by the Bitcoin network\u2014or 0.15 percent of the total world consumption of electricity.\n\nSo that's a lot. And one defense I have heard is that the traditional finance networks take up a lot too but that's sort of addressed:\n\n> Digiconomy estimates that the entire Visa credit network uses about a three-thousandth the total energy of Bitcoin. That doesn\u2019t take into account the electricity used by Visa offices, but on the other hand, unlike with bitcoin you can actually buy things with Visa. Oh, and Google\u2014all of Google, the whole Google\u2014used only 5.7 TWh in 2015 and went completely renewable in 2017.\n\nThere was some other stuff in the article that seemed fairly clued in. Not a bad read.\n\n",

The perfect wallet for me is secure, anonymous, safe, user friendly (newbie), handles multiple coins, allows segwit... anyone care to point me in the right direction (iOS). \n\n2. Also, if I want to give bitcoin to someone (as a gift), will there be fees involved in that? \n\n3. How do I get my bitcoin off of coinbase and into my wallet? \n\nThanks and merry Christmas. ",

What's the best course of action if I actually want to access the money I've got in there without spending a third of it on fees to get it the hell out? Or is this a HODL up and I should just let it mellow for now? (Not looking to pull out of BTC, just want my BTC somewhere that I can access it and use it to buy shit if I want). ",

On gdax, when I transfer some to my euro wallet...what actually happens to these 'coins'? They disappear from the 22 billion or whatever in eventual existence? What do gdax do? Sorry if a stupid question.\n\nSecondly, I want to buy other stuff... monereum, ripple, maybe verge, dash too (opinions welcome on these), but maybe just 100-200 USD each to start....part b) I want to buy with non crypto currency...are there any exchanges that do this? And pretty quickly too.\n\nThirdly, I need a wallet, I'll get onto that...is paper one sufficient if I don't hold thousands of dollars?",

            "Text": "What's stopping the average Joe is typically problems moving currency between exchanges quickly enough or in enough volume to equalize price.\n\nThe extent you see different prices on different exchanges is basically an indication of these problems, otherwise someone would keep doing it until prices equalized.\n\nIf you have gobs of money you can keep pools on multiple exchanges and that gives you a buffer on timing to move currency.\n\nIt's also a lot of fiddly work so ideally you want bots to do it for you.\n\nEDIT: High btc tx fees also cause this. For example, it's free to move BTC out of GDAX but not Bitfinex. Therefore you have to move enough BTC to make enough profit to overcome the fees if you buy on Bitfinex and sell at a higher price on GDAX, because you have to pay a TX fee to transfer the btc from Bitfinex to GDAX. You also have to wait for the transfer to clear and the price can change a lot in that time.",

Energy is always cheapest where supply most exceeds demand.\n\nThis occurs where facilities are built to meet anticipated future growth, rather than current actual demand. \n\nWe suck at storing electricity, so it frequently goes to waste. Also, many of these facilities are renewable sources that can't just be shut down when we don't need them (ie. Dams/Turbines).\n\nInteresting argument, he explains it much better. ",

Their most important value will be stability of price. They will follow basic economic principles where all coins will find a balance according to their relative utility with a race to maximize their value. \n\nTrue clones can become pegged in a bout of sustained irrationality until they slowly die by one black swan after another. However if adding features reduces value upsets could occur.",

First, it is said that electricity should be used in areas where it is cheap...but there is no mention of possible alternative uses for the electricity, expspecially the possibility that the electricity could be used to further imorove human living conditions. The argument glosses over that as basically saying \"well its cheap so they must nit like electricity so the best thing we can do is mine btc with it.\" \n\nSecond - and this is more important to btc holders - it does nothin pg to address future scenarios where the cheap electricity becomes expensive. I think the video vaugely implies that miners will just go somewhere else...but...not sure I buy it",

How do you propose that overproduction of electricity could feasibly be harnessed to \"improve living conditions\"? Can you give an example? \n\n>\"well its cheap so they must not like electricity so the best thing we can do is mine btc with it.\"\n\nThat's not the argument. It's only cheap because nobody else is currently using it. Supply and demand. So it's being utilised to do something highly profitable.\n\nThe point is that critics are trying to portray bitcoin mining as something that destroys rainforests and wastes electricity that people erroneously perceive could somehow be used to end hunger or something. Andreas' point is that this is disingenuous when you look at the reality - it's otherwise wasted.\n\n>I think the video vaguely implies that miners will just go somewhere else...\n\nOf course they will. If they're willing to buy expensive specialised computers for the purpose of maximising mining profits, they'll relocate these computers to further maximise profits. \n\nBitmain make approximately $7 million PER DAY by mining. If there's a place where they can save 30% on power bills, what do you think they're going to do? ",

(LTCM) was a hedge fund management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that used absolute-return trading strategies combined with high financial leverage. The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998, among 16 financial institutions\u2014which included Bankers Trust, Barclays, Bear Stearns, Chase Manhattan Bank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Paribas, Salomon Smith Barney, Societe Generale, and UBS\u2014for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.\n\nLTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a \"new method to determine the value of derivatives\".\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

It is more likely ICX to reach 20 USD than NEO to reach 150 USD. Between the 2, the safest is NEO, but if you feel a bit of a gambler, go for ICX :).",

That cannot happen without a significant blocksize increase.\n\nIf shitbag, disgusting core devs want to drag btc through the mud then they deserve every last criticism and attack they get and more.\n\nVery, very simple solution. Core should continue their pursuits in efficiency upgrades and second layer solutions, AND opt for a blocksize to make it competitive on-chain with bitcoin cash.\n\nI don't want BTC to lose as it will hugely impact the market and destroy confidence in a very negative way, but until this cult realises that a blocksize increase is 100% necessary I will support BCH and the failure and collapse of BTC. I don't want it, but you're bringing it on yourselves. ",
