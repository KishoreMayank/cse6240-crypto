I was trying to discuss with my dad Bitcoin\u2019s current fees, and how everyone is excited for Lightning network coming.  He keeps cutting me off and telling me that with BTC coming to some ETFs (exchange traded funds) you won\u2019t have to pay these fees. \n\nI\u2019m like Dad, nah, that\u2019s different. Those ETFs aren\u2019t moving BTC around, they\u2019re like the futures. Bitcoin is on a Blockchain etc. He just kept shutting me down and told me to \u201clook it up.\u201d LOOOL Can anyone else share their frustrating experiences talking to fam about crypto? :(",

This is a risk as I don\u2019t own my keys. As such I should transfer these to a hard wallet..I.e a Trezor or a Ledger. To do this I should use GDAX as this doesn\u2019t cost anything.\n\n(2) The hardware wallet will come with a 24 word recover phrase...this should be written down and never lost \n\n(3) The Trezor/Ledger has a Public & a Private key.  What is the difference between these and when should each be used? What difference is this to the generated address by the Ledger each time a transfer is needed?\n\n(4) The Ledger creates a new address each time a transfer is to be made.  Simply paste this into GDAX....send. And that\u2019s all??\n\n(5) If I want to sell bitcoin, what\u2019s the best way? Transfer back to GDAX? How is this done?\n\nAnything else major that I\u2019m missing???\n\nThanks all!\n\n\n\n\n",

            "Text": "silly question.  Bitcoin gets mined in coins, but can be traded / exchanged in fractional coins all the way down to Satoshi.  Does the block chain have to keep track of every individual satoshi and the associated address, that seem silly slow and wasteful.  So how does blockchain deal with coin unit fragmentation?  My balance could have originated from multiple sources, but when I transfer it all to one address, presumably the part bits have to be transferred rather than a single unit of whatever size.  Given there is full audit tracability in the blockchain of which addresses any part of a coin got transferred through then that argues the fragments have to be tracked.  If that is true.. then while Bitcoin is relatively unpopular / low value the fragments will be larger but if Bitsoin displaces FIAT which will also likely mean the value rapidly grows then transactions will be in ever smaller fractions of a coin and conceivable the whole block of issued coins gets increasingly fragmented into smaller and smaller chunks.  It seem like this would result in transactions becoming increasingly onerous to process / track and the size of the block chain transaction history...\n\nWhat am I missing?",

So I read this thread a few weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/seedboxes/comments/7iwws1/last_night_i_paid_12_bitcoin_fee_on_a_60_euro/ it seemed like the general consensus was that BTC has really high fees and that it doesn't have a future because of it. I've heard people say that even people who use Bitcoin to purchase actual things knows it doesn't have a future. I've seen people over at r/CryptoCurrency say the last couple of days that it's only value is name recognition. Thoughts?",

The bounce to 14 is nice, but I am afraid it won't hold since yesterday broke the pattern of slightly higher highs followed by slightly higher lows. I sold yesterday when it broke support and I'm waiting to pick it up lower.  We probably won't see any really big moves until after the new year when volume picks back up.  Even if it just moves sideways for the next few days that's a healthy sign and will help to make any further coming dips less painful/deep.",

Or you could hold out for an entry point that is lower than right now, but there's a *chance* this could actually not happen. Ask someone who didn't buy at $2000 because they were waiting for $1800.)\n\nIt's always a good time to buy if you're holding for more than a week or two, but that's assuming the price doesn't irreparably plummet, which nobody knows either way.\n\nPeople buy, and then a week later they see a 20% dip in price, so they feel regret that they should have waited. But then a year later it's up 1000% from the dip price anyway. Above all, nobody can predict when the dips will happen, no matter how confident they sound. \n\nUnless you're psychic or a master market analyst, always assume it's a good time to buy if you believe in the tech, and only invest what you can afford to lose.

What is the difference between these and when should each be used? What difference is this to the generated address by the Ledger each time a transfer is needed?\n\nI don't know anything about the Ledger. The Tresor will generate public and private keys from the 24-word seed above. Private keys stay on the Tresor, public keys are your bitcoin addresses that you use to receive.\n\n> (4) The Ledger creates a new address each time a transfer is to be made. Simply paste this into GDAX....send. And that\u2019s all??\n\nBasically, yes. If it's a large amount I'd maybe send a small test TX first. Bitcoin addresses have a built-in checksum which helps protect you from typos. It doesn't protect you from using another (but wrong) address.\n\n> (5) If I want to sell bitcoin, what\u2019s the best way? Transfer back to GDAX? How is this done?\n\nGDAX will give you a deposit address, and you send from your Tresor/Ledger wallet. Just the opposite of withdrawing.",

            "Text": "The thresholds in scalability are (currently) not storage space, they are a matter of bandwidth and more specifically upload speeds and latency. \n\n\nYes buying a 2TB hard drive would keep you personally going for a while, but on-chain scaling at such a pace would effectively cut out a large amount of the nodes that help to keep the network decentralised and censorship resistant.\n\n\nYou also misunderstand what Bitcoin Core developers are trying to achieve here (and somehow assume they're not aware of high fees?). Developers are not as interested in achieving \"price goals\" and you should be VERY happy about that. If the goal is only to get the price as high as possible, then they will always cut corners and overhype everything.\n\n\nBitcoin Core developers want to build sound technology that will change the world in the long term. Scaling through quick-wins on-chain each time people flood the memory pool with transactions will not hold out. We need permanent scalable solutions and the Lightning Network will begin to help us in that direction.",

Does anyone have a link that explains it to a noob like me?\n\nThe short version is it's a layer on top of bitcoin that lets users form a second network. In this network payments can be sent instantly. Creating and destroying links in the network requires transactions on the blockchain. All transactions that happen in the channel are synchronized back to the blockchain when the channels are closed. You can send through the network by hopping a bunch of nodes that all have channels, i.e. if A<-->B<-->C is a network, A can send to C through B, A does not need a channel with C.\n\n> Also, I know at least I want to support it, because it\u2019s important to the growth of bitcoin. How would I do that?\n\nI think step one for you right now is to read up on it more. Step 2 is maybe to try and set up a testnet lightning node.",

With another doubling in users we'd be looking at $100 fees to do this.\n\nIf they're not interested in price then people will leave. No reason to stick around with a coin that is happy to lose me money and with developers who aren't interested in the user experience and desires of low fees and reasonable tx times.\n\n16mb blocks would cut out almost no one, and the idea that in 2018 people can't handle the bandwith and upload speed requirements of 16mb blocks in is utterly ludicrous, and quite frankly, an outright lie.\n\nPathetic.

            "Text": "It will require fees, so recently there was a new breakthrough posted of having Lightning upon Lightning layer, which would eliminate most of this. Granted it will take time to build.\n\nYes people will leave, because the tech can\u2019t keep up with the pace of adoption. The primary goal of Bitcoin is censorship resistance though, it should not try to cater to many of the new people who onboarded and insist on all having instant near free on-chain transactions. That\u2019s a losing battle which compromises everything else we\u2019ve built up.\n\nThe developers are definitely interested in UX, within the realm of what is possible to achieve for them. By switching to 16MB blocks or whatever, you embark on a permanent path you can\u2019t turn back from. A bad call will permanently screw you in the future. One of the aspects of that step is cutting out all Tor nodes, providing full transparency on where all nodes are hosted.\n\nWhat do you think will begin to happen to Bitcoin when its market cap is in the trillions, it is challenging central banking and there are only a few hundred nodes left, most of which controlled by for-profit companies under government pressure?\n\nShow me the data that proves it would cut out almost nobody. It sounds to me like you haven\u2019t ran a node and you\u2019re just assuming everyone is in the privileged position you are.\n\nIf you\u2019re upset Bitcoin doesn\u2019t make you enough money, by all means go to another cryptocurrency with bold claims that will run into the same scalability challenges. If it was as simple as changing one parameter, it would\u2019ve been done long ago. Have a little faith in the people that brought us this far, they are working tirelessly.",

It's all quite mind boggling to me even though I started to participate.\n\nIf you want to see just how much overlay Google trends with the price of some coins.

So long term I can only recommend bitcoin, because I feel any innovation that is actually found to be worthwhile from alts will eventually just be stacked atop of bitcoin. \n\nNow if you wanna play the alt markets to earn more BTC, I support you but I don't have any advice as I was burned years ago on alts and have already learned my lesson. \n\nA lot of folks repeat that old adage \"buy low, sell high,\" but I doubt they realize how low is low with alts. \n\nLitecoin, for example, hit an all-time high in 2014 around $60, within a year it went under a dollar. Now if you held through that you'd be in the green, but your returns would be far less than if you had just held bitcoin. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm biased. I'm a bitcoin maximalist ",

So their supporters often push a narrative that bitcoin is old tech that's broken, switch to ours that's technically superior. \n\nThe reality is those coins are fast and cheap to use because they're barely being used, especially when compared to bitcoin. If they had anything near the user base of bitcoin they'd all have their own scaling issues as well. \n\nNow here's the kicker, scaling solutions for bitcoin have been in the works for a while now and some are coming online (e.g. Lightening Network). Bitcoin needs to scale exponentially, which is complicated by the fact that blockchains are horrible at scaling while maintaining their distributed nature. \n\nI suspect once Lightening Network matures and bitcoin has instant, cheap transactions, and micro-transactions are finally a reality, the selling points for most alts will disappear and their speculative value will plummet. \n\nCheck out the LN project when you have time. It's an amazing concept with far-reaching implications for bitcoin's use cases. \n\nhttps://lightning.network",

            "Text": "thanks for the link I will do some more reading.  \n\nI have been reading a load of articles today, and I think I am starting to get how block chain is working now....\n\nIf I have it correct, it does not track unique coins (i.e coins / satoshis are not individually serialized) but it tracks the cumulative balance of coins that sit at an address, and then tracks all the input transactions (presumably less all output transactions) to prove the residual balance.  So it is not so much that a specific coin which arrived from a specific input is transferred to a new public address, but that an ammount is debited from the one public address and credited to another.\n\nSo if i am right in my head with that, you dont have to worry about fractional coins because we are not tracking explicitly uniquely identifiable tokens beyond they constitute part of a balance.  So thinking this through if A and B transfer 1 and 2 coin ressepctively to C, and C then transfers 0.5 coin to D, while the balance of C is now 2.5 - there is not identity or concept of what that is comprised of other than the input less the output.  I.e we can not say C's balance is 0.5 of the original A coin and 2.0 of the original B coin or 1.0 of the original A coin and 1.5 of the B coin or any fraction inbetween.  So.... I think my conclusion, is while you can \"track\" coins when the addresses they are transferred from and to have singular (few) transactions, that when an holder of bitcoin used a single address to receive / send coins from many many parties - then it is not implicitly possible to say that specific coin originated from A is currently those specific elements and not another part of the balance (that existed in the inputs and outputs upto the timestamp at that point) is now at this other point in time distributed at these explicit addresses... is that correct? Not that I am sure this particularly matters as that is how banks / electronic fiat works as well.  Coins are only uniqiue in so far as they can only contribute to the balance at one public address at any one point in time.  Is that sort of right?\n\nThanks",

I think the irrational hype-driven markets, however, are a joke.
