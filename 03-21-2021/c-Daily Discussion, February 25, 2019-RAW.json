He has said that blockchain is a very useful technology but doesn\u2019t describe how it\u2019s so important and then proceeds to dump on bitcoin.  \n\nBuffet is a very good investor and it worries me about his negative outlook on bitcoin but it also seems to me that it is impossible for him to understand the great potential of an international currency with no middle men. \n\nDoes anyone have an opinion on this.",

That is a terrible measure. Of course, more Bitcoin will be traded when the price is $3,000 than when it was $6,000. There may be greater volume in Bitcoins trades but not greater USD value. At its peak, Bitcoin traded at $25 bill 24-hr volume. The value is more important than the number of Bitcoins. The number of Bitcoins is a bad measure after Bitcoin has lost 80% of its value from its all time high. Volume is important but it\u2019s very easy to be misguided when looking at the number of Bitcoins trades per day. Thoughts?",

            "Text": "From investopedia:\n\nWarren Buffett has often said he avoids investing in the technology sector because he does not like to own stocks in companies whose business he does not understand. Even during the dotcom boom, Buffett shied away from buying stock in hot internet companies. While some have characterized Buffett\u2019s avoidance of the technology sector as his inability to understand technology, there may be a solid reason from a value investing perspective.\n\nThe Economic Moat\nDuring the dot-com boom, Buffett identified two specific reasons why he generally avoids investing in the tech sector. The first reason is technology companies have limited the economic moat as a competitive advantage. The moat concept is a principle of Buffett\u2019s style of value investing; it refers to the competitive advantage a company has in its business that allows it to generate long-term profits and continue growing market share versus competitors. The moat serves as a buffer of protection for continued profitability.\n\nHard to Pick a Winner\nThe second reason is Buffett believes it is difficult to pick winners in the technology sector early on and build a position at a reasonable price. Even a general survey of companies from the dotcom boom shows how some that seem to be unstoppable are capable of falling apart. Thus, there appears to be some truth in what Buffett is saying.\n\nStill, Buffett has not completely avoided technology companies. As of May 2018, Berkshire Hathaway owned 165.3 million shares in Apple, valued around $42.5 billion. This investment seemingly replaces the company's 2011 investment in the tech sector when it bought 64 million shares of IBM stock, which were subsequently sold in 2017 and 2018.\n",

            "Text": "I think there's a few reasons. The fundamental one is he's an equities guy, been one his whole life. He understands good management, capital structures and cash flow streams like just about no one else but that's all he's ever focused on his whole life, so he has basically no understanding of monetary value's origin and nature which is a whole different animal. He doesn't understand all monetary value is entirely a societal construct and has no intrinsic value by nature. \n\nFrom there his comfort zone tells him that something that yields nothing (\"bitcoin doesn't make babies\") should be worth nothing, and he falls in the classic \"it must be a bubble / ponzi\" fallacy that anyone who doesn't understand money falls into constantly, failing to understand that all monetary value is a sustained bubble by construct. \n\nOf course monetary value, abstract as it is, holds roughly as much market value as all other \"real\" assets combined basically, (a ton more than in equities incidentally) up to 300tn depending on what you count and basically just about all of it at this point is invested in fiat currencies. By his logic he should be hard core ignoring cryptos which are still irrelevant and calling USD toxic rat poison square as well, but i suspect he doesn't do that because he's grown up with it so \"dollars are normal but bitcoins are a scam\" and he's seen dollars work all his life so they must be fine. Also they come with some government legitimacy which makes them feel legit.\n\nFinally it's definitely harder for older people to wrap their brains about new concepts, especially technological ones, which cryptos obviously are, in being technologically enabled decentralized digital monetary vehicles. You have to have an open mind (being young helps), be a tech and econ nerd to properly get it or live in Venezuela. He clearly is none of that.\n\nTo his credit, I'm guessing he doesn't actively go out and crap on cryptos but as a finance opinion leader, people must ask him all the time, and he's naturally inclined to at least quickly give his opinion on the matter, which obviously I for one (and most on this sub) will strongly disagree with.",

If you are running a Bitcoin node off your work laptop, probably no danger.  If you are running a Bitcoin node on a compromised machine with an open telnet port granting root access to anyone who knows your IP, yes, danger.  But you're probably not doing that.  \n\nYou're not really directly susceptible to attack. Your IP address is known and scanned regularly by really bad guys.  So go ahead and tell them.",

If you're trading and haven't already built up a solidly-in-the-black long-term hodl stack, you're still thinking in terms of fiat which means you don't have the foggiest clue what you're trading and should therefore probably not be trading it.  Personally, I only trade to get more BTC.  I could gaf about the price in fiat terms.",
