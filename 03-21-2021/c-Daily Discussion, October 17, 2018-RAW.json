When these posters stop trying to spread bullshit about bitcoin being dead, failed or going to drop below 6k, then it will be too late.\n\nWhen people say they wish they'd bought bitcoin when it was a fraction of the current price at that time, the reason they didn't buy it then is usually because people are afraid that it's too risky. By the time everyone wants to buy it, the opportunity has aleady passed.",

When people sell off tether batches of it go back and are redeemed for US Dollars shrinking the supply . when US Dollars come in more tether is printed. Everyone knew tether had a lot of money in the bank but people question if they have a 100% ratio in the bank. If they don't, you want to get out early. Before the money goes dry. \n\nThere are also better options. Winkle coin has been doing really well. It does everything tether did only better. Also noteworthy there is nearly three times as much tether on the market right now as there was in December of 2017. There are a ton of people waiting on the sidelines with cash in hand. ",

            "Text": "In theory you can convert it back into USD at any time. As long as people believe that then it will stay close to US$1 through arbitrage. The price you see now is the market applying a risk factor on whether Tether is 100% backed or that you can actually redeem it for USD.\n\nThe reality is that like most things, Tether is trading on confidence and if confidence is lost then the value of Tether will collapse. If Tether.io actually had the US$2.x billion dollars needed then someone could make a lot of money as the price drops but the reality is that they probably have 10% of that (like most banks/ponzi schemes) and even if they did have it, there's no way either them or the bank(s) they're using/conning are going to give it up.\n\nThe more interesting thing is to see what the collapse of Tether does to the price of BTC. If there is a somewhat orderly exit from Tether (this is what is happening right now) and the position is unwound then when it does collapse the impact may not be significant. But if Tether lets go in a hurry, and it probably will, then expect to see some carnage. BTC is yet to prove it's worth as anything more than a gambling platform and if people don't think they can win at any odds then they probably won't want to play the game.",

We could even confirm if it became an invalid transaction somehow. In the end it's an easy way to pass on a lot of information and allows us to make some deductions like the fact that cryptopia hasn't presented a transaction ID at all would indicate that it hasn't been processed and sent to the network yet and that the slowness is on cryptopia part or that he sent a reasonable fee but the network might be a little backlogged with higher fees and he should expect it sometime and say the next 6 hours if conditions remain the same etc etc",
