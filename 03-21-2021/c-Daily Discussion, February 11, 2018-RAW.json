From what I've read, market Instability and no resale value is what prevents these frm being the go to for mining.(again, I might be wrong, but that's what I think I've learned so far)\n\nSo, IF Asics are faster, what would it take for miners to make these their go to rigs? Gpus used to be the affordable option, but with this ridiculous gpu bubble, does that make miners take a second glance at Asics? How much will a gpu have to cost before they are just not profitable enough? How about if the market stabilizes and steadily inclined, combined with more and more people using the slower gpus? Is there a point where you would need to up the competition to get an edge?( I'm no expert, but I do see that being the trend, it will never replace hard currency, but it will stabilize and increase in value, becoming more like PayPal than the federal reserve. Bad analogy but I think you get the idea.\n\nFull disclosure, I did this research because I hope to build a gaming pc, but with my financial situation, I just cannot justify paying almost double the price for a gpu, so I researched. I don't blame anyone, it's all about getting the right tool foe the job, I can respect that.",

Holding the line above 8250 but until we broke out for a couple of days, we were right at the end of a double bear flag. It'll be good to test the lows of the 3-month uptrend one more time and gain momentum over February to break 9k for good.",

Whatever you file as your normal tax bracket will be the same. You can look it up on IRS website based on your yearly income. Use the calcuate tab to let it process all your trades. It has multiple methods and will tell you what the cheapest is and you just click that bubble to use it. The only issue I had is that if you do your taxes online with Turbotax, they have no option for uploading all the forms for the trades. I saw something about you having to used the DVD version which I am not going to use since I've always done it online. I just entered the full amount on the output report which is at the very bottom and takes some ciphering to see the 2 values to input but they should match the amount you owe. That is why I need to make 6K before April deadline :/",

            "Text": "Actually, the bitcoins from the Genesis block is unspendable by design. I think Satoshis reasoning was that it was more fair that way since noone else had the opportunity to mine those, while all later blocks were possible to mine for anyone who dedicated processing power to the network.\n\nIt's the other blocks purportedly mined by Satoshi that people are watching. I think the main fear is that the price would tank if Satoshi moved any of his coins. Many believes they are lost and so not part of the available supply, if Satoshi starts move his/her/their coins it means the supply is bigger than many thought, which can bring the price down.\n\nMyself, I definitely believe Satoshis coins are still in his/her/their possession. Satoshi was very clear that you should never delete/thow away any private keys, I'd be surprised if Satoshi would have been careless about his/her/their own keys.",

The powerful reversals typically occur when the pattern took over 1 yr to develop.\n\nShort term traders can use it for reference, but I'd caution against trading based exclusively on this. It's nowhere near as reliable if the pattern is just minutes, hours or a few days old. \n\nAlgorithms(bots) can easily draw a short-term head & shoulders pattern to lure traders into false reversals.

The government could sub poena Coinbase, which could link the transaction to your bank account.\n\nSome other cryptocurrencies have mechanisms for true anonymity. In lieu of a technical solution, Bitcoin needs to be laundered like regular cash.\n\nNote: AML laws in the US require that every bank file a SAR report with the US Treasury whenever a cash/cash equivalent deposit of $5000 is made to any bank account.

The Satoshi-Awards is in fact just an indirect way of getting crypto to sit around the same table and (hopefully) start formulating a combined strategy to contribute and influence the coming wave of regulation. I suspect that 2018 will be the year in which the outline of crypto regulation will be formatted and since we're so divided we are not giving any input, which is idiotic.  The Satoshi-Awards is the only way that I can think of to motivate cryptos to come together.",

I can't justify BTC having better fundamentals than these two, and BTC went up much more than AMZN and YHOO on a percentage basis during the bubble phase.",

I do not believe that we will see BTC go below 6k. But am prepared for it if it does. Trust but verify.",
