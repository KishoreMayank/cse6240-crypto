            "Text": "Just to give some perspective from a long time investor i.e. 25 years in the market. It is very hard to trade in and out of assets\u2026 I have been mostly in stocks, but I tend just sell either too early or too late. I\u2019ve had some good stock picks, but also some bad ones over the years. Luckily 99% of my portfolio is index funds so I\u2019m still doing great. Even though I\u2019m up 250 percent on bitcoin, I know it can correct sharply At any time. If that does happen, and you panic sell, don\u2019t let that deter you from investing for the long term in broader-based investments like index funds. This is fun and crazy times but not typical. A long-term strategy for real investing is the way to wealth, but it will take more patience. Good luck to all",

At 3am?\n\nTAKE THE HODL NOFAP PLEDGE! not frequently assessing prices\n\nBasic pledge (aka \"HODL Weds\"): Only check prices on ONCE A WEEK on Wednesdays! Hourly or daily prices fluctuate, but week over week is generally very positive. Then when you load up livecoinwatch (or whatever you use), you'll see that BIG gain every Wednesday and have a BIG grin. :D\n\nAdvanced pledges: - Real /nofap - Fap only if you reach your gains! (say \"HODL nofap BTC $20k\" for example) . Alternate: You may substitute nofap with \"nocake\" or \"nobeer\" - HODL Monthly - check only on the first Weds of the month! - HODL Annual - check only on New Year's eve!\n\nPSA: Crypto will change the world\u2014and it may change your life\u2014but it shouldn't control your life or cause you stress. Go out, live your life, check back once in awhile. The longer you wait between checks, the bigger the satisfaction. I didn't check for 2 years and only broadly heard on the news that crypto was skyrocketing\u2014then on Thanksgiving, I finally checked. Turkey never tasted so good!",

As an incentive to get people to use bitcoin, they will pass some of these savings onto the customer and offer a 1-2% discount for those using bitcoin. Once people can save money by spending bitcoin then they will begin to use it.\n\nIt's looking like 2018 is the year that Lightning Network gets up and running and 2019 is the year Bitcoin really goes mainstream.",

Sure I believe in it's technology and what not but everyone here is so excited that their bitcoin is worth X amount in usd/eur etc. At the end of the day you can't do anything useful with your bitcoins other than turn it into fiat. \n\nThe dot com bubble inflated due to a similar issue in my mind. Everyone believed in the internet as an idea and therefore invested. Similarly, many believe in the idea of bitcoin but it's lack of fundamentals are problematic.\n\nJust like the dot com bubble didn't mean the end of the internet, a bitcoin bubble doesn't have to kill your crypto fantasies. I'm just sayin it's pretty ridiculous to call bitcoin a currency without being able to buy hardly anything with it.",

With that said, I understand that Bitcoin has scalability issues and that LN is the solution.  In the meantime, I want to understand what the current limitations are.  Assuming that everyone buying into Bitcoin right now is simply buying to hold as a store of value, what rate of purchases can the network handle at this time?\n\nWith all of the mania going on around Bitcoin's price right now and everyone buying in, I'm really curious to know if it's possible that we get to a point where so many people are buying in that a backlog grows to something that can't be settled in a matter of minutes or hours.  What would happen if the rate of orders on exchanges eclipses the maximum transaction rate of the network for a sustained period of time?  At this point I know that we've only had a few minor network congestions but I just want to understand how far we are right now from a major network congestion.",

I drew a line to illustrate this. Now, whether or not the climb continues is the big question.\n\nLitecoin 30 day chart\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Oy1SDEs.png\nFrom Nov 16 to around Dec 6, litecoin was climbing at a slow but reasonable pace. The climb would begin to steepen and then spike and sit idle around $300. With not as much data to rely on, it is anyones guess as to which way ltc will go. It certainly looks to be the more volatile crypocurrency of the 3 so far.\n\n\nEthereum 30 day chart\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Sf9bIAv.png\n\nWhat even is a big selloff? ETH gives no fucks, seems to be a lot of confidence around this one. While it has been increasing steadily like LTC, it has recently also spiked but doesn't seem to care too much about major sell offs. Sure it went down to around $650 very recently but quickly bounced back to around $750 as of this post.\n\nPersonally, I plan on exiting LTC in the near future as there is just too much uncertainty around it for now.\n\nBTC really is fun to play with. As the more \"mainstream\" cryptocurrency, it seems there is a lot of panic around big selloffs resulting in pretty decent swings in price.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on ETH right now. Seems to have a lot of potential for growth in my opinion.",

I've been reading through the wiki / FAQs and linked sites, let me know if I have this straight.\n\nYou buy BTC or any other AltCoin on an exchange like Coinbase, GDAX, BitStamp, etc and you can store / manage your coins...\n\n* through these third party exchanges (not recommended)\n\n* via a dedicated Wallet App like BreadWallet (slightly better)\n\n* or get a Hard Wallet like Trezor or Ledger to store your coins & use the app wallets for small amounts or when you need to move coins (recommended approach)\n\nAfter that it's your decision whether you're storing as an investment or moving coins around more frequently for purchases, etc\n\nI guess I have a couple questions:\n\n* How easy is it to move coins from the exchange to your wallet app to your hard wallet and back?\n\n* Can you just buy off the exchanges directly into your hard wallet and vice versa, or is the app middleman required?\n\n* Can Wallet Apps / Hard Wallets all store the various types of altcoins outside of BTC, or only certain major ones? Does that ever change?\n\nEdit: Additional Q: Does everyone need to install a Bitcoin client from bitcoin.org in order to get started and to sync wallets with the blockchain?",

Please be gentle and help me understand what's going on here.\n\nI recently bought a little bit of bitcoin from coinbase. I had read that I could use GDAX to transfer that money from coinbase/GDAX to my wallet and avoid the fees that I had been paying by sending it from coinbase to my wallet.\n\nI sent a small test transfer (a buck or two) to make sure I did it OK. It took a while, but it came through a few hours later. So I send the second (remaining balance) over to my wallet from GDAX. Now my wallet is giving me the message for both transactions \"the amount is too low to spend\" (about $50). \n\nThese transactions both have several confirmations.\n\nIs my money lost, or will it ever be added to my wallet balance? Is there a way to \"fix it\"?",

Is that already the paper wallet and the private key? \n\nAlso, I have transferred my coins already. But when I enter the app, I can just go to the settings and see the 12 words again. Exact same words. That, for me, does not look safe. Because other people can just copy that through the settings if they can access my phone and just go send all everything to a different address. \n\nWhat should I do to remedy this? I thought of deleting the app and just reinstall it if I need to trade/use my coins back into the exchange. \n\nThanks! ",

            "Text": "How does GDAX credit your account with Bitcoin that was acquired in odd lot trades? If I place a market order for 1BTC and get filled at several smaller layers of quoted liquidity, does GDAX credit my account with each limit order (i.e., get a new public address for each trade execution that made up a fraction of my 1BTC order)?\n\nOr do they consolidate it somehow, and I receive one public address for my 1BTC order? Seems like there would be transaction fee issues as it's not uncommon to see people trading in 0.001BTC lots.",

Of course I didn't have any money, so instead I collected from faucets and eventually saved up to a full bitcent. I haven't messed with is since. \n\nAfter seeing Bitcoin in the news a few times recently I decided to see how much it was worth, and that was $165. It used to be just $2.50\n\nANYWAYS, the past few days I've been considering trading it to see if I could get any more out of it to help pay for college soon. I still know general little about Bitcoin compared to those on this subreddit. So, what do I need to know, and what should I do? \n\nThanks guys. ",

But which payment rails actually process these payments?\n\nI'm trying to figure out how a merchant could accept these cards in a technical sense -- so which debit and/or credit network(s) support bitcoin payment cards -- and how much it costs for merchants to process these cards, especially in comparison to regular credit and debit interchange rates.\n\nAny info would be incredibly helpful!

I have a question about keeping my BTC secure.\n\nSo I am one of those lucky ones that, within the last week, found my private key to my lost wallet that has just over 2 BTC, purchased a couple of years ago.  \n\nI want to know if what I am doing now with storing my BTC is safe.  I am using mycelium on my android phone and android tablet and I have my BTC in a wallet in mycelium, I am 100% sure I have a safe and secure backup of my wallet to restore in mycelium.\n\nI read the FAQ about multi-sig wallets and I installed Electrum on my phone and then my tablet.  I created a new, separate, multi-sig wallet on each device and added the other as a cosigner.  I believe I have it setup successfully for multi-sig. I don't plan on using BTC for transactions, just hodl.  Other, more secure suggestions?\n\nDo I just send my BTC from my wallet in mycelium to the public address of the wallet in Electrum?",

Anyways, I am going to study abroad in a place without wifi which means I am trying to sell my online assets. I have bitcoinyouth.com, largebitcoin.com, and litecoinbanker.com if anyone is interested. The price will be the lowest you have ever seen because I truly just need to get rid of them.

            "Text": "> I'm having trouble understanding how the lightning network is going to speed up transactions/reduce fees. So won't you have to keep a channel open with say \"Amazon\" as long as you want to pay them and that whole time your money is tied up?\n\nYes, as long as a channel is open, you have some funds tied up in that channel.  However, we are likely going to see the formation of some kind of payment hub.  These could be regional based, or really any kind of group you can imagine... maybe your local college/university runs a student payment hub.  In that model, you will have a channel open with the hub and the hub will have channels open with vendors that are somehow related to that hub.  So... say you live in Smithville, there might be a \"Smithville Payment Hub\", \"Smithville Payment Hub\" in turn has channels open with the local grocery store, coffee shop, pet food store, conveneince stores, etc.  You in turn only need to open a channel with the \"Smithville Payment Hub\" to gain access to every channel that they have open.  \"Smithville Payment Hub\", might also have a channel open to the neighboring town of \"Nowheresville\", which then has channels open with local vendors.  So yes, you have some funds tied up for keeping a channel open... but you don't have to be opening channels with every single person you want to transact with.  A real ideal situation is there is no payment hubs and it goes more denctralized than that... but reality is it probably won't end up that way.\n\n> Does the lightning network automatically route the transaction from peer to peer, like a larger blockchain running paralell to the current one?\n\nYes, Lightning network routes from peer to peer trying to find the cheapest path available for you.  So again thinking to my previous example... say you are a student in Smithville, you goto Smithville College.  Smithville has a city-wide payment hub, Smithville College Student Union also has a payment hub, you have channels open with both.  Vendors maybe give a discount or charge less fees for using Student Union hub, so Lightning will automatically route you through the Student Union Hub.\n\n> I also have a bitcoin cash question, why did bitcoin cashers not adopt segwit when they hard forked? So they increased the blocksize (which i think probably makes sense is right) but they didn't implement SEGWIT2. Why?\n\nBitcoin Cash was forked from Bitcoin before SegWit was activated.  However Bitcoin Cash people think that SegWit is the devil and makes Bitcoin code too complicated the way it was implemented (soft fork vs. hard fork).  You'll hear them throw around the term \"technical debt\".\n\n> Also ya can someone explain why increasing the blocksize is good/bad/doesn't actually matter. Isn't the point of bitcoin to have a spendable money that is nearly instant? Would BTC benefit if we increased the blocksize? Or are there strains that would create that Im not thinking off (total blockchain size for EX)\n\nMost people believe that blocksize will need to increase at some point.  It would certainly be useful at this very moment, but proper Segwit adoption using bech32 addresses and Lightning networking going live may show that it was not needed yet.  Larger blocks are \"bad\" because they increase the amount of data storage a node needs, increases processor time needed to validate the transaction within a block, and increases network propagation time which can lead to more orphaned blocks - which can result in people losing money.\n\n> Also when bitcoin cash was created, that means they minted 100% of all bitcoins again as \"bitcoin cash\" (read Bcash aaay) so doesn't that drive down the value of their currency? Because there's already 16M coins in circulation owned by other people?\n\nThey did not re-mint anything.  Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have a shared transaction history.  Think of it like this... the blockchain is like a path in the forest, except instead of moving forward one step at a time forward, when you receive a transaction your transaction always appears at the furthest most point that anybody has been down that path and everytime a new block is found a little bit more of the path is discovered.  When you then spend that money you received, you are instantly teleported from where you entered the path to again the furthest point that the path has now been discovered.  A fork, like Bitcoin Cash, its like a group of people deciding that they want to diverge off the path the majority are on and take a different branch on the path.  From that moment forward anybody that wants to join the blockchain has to decide which path they want to take.  Something special happens for all of the transation that existed on the path before the split however.  They don't have to choose which path to enter, they can actually take both paths simultaneously.  \n\nI hope that makes sense...",

            "Text": "The same receiving address can be used as many times as required. Generation of new receiving addresses is a privacy feature so that nobody can keep track of how much you have cumulatively. If you have an older receiving address and don't care about anyone tracking you or whatever, then by all means, continue using it.\n\nYou should understand that cryptocurrency wallets have a private key, a public key and (potentially multiple) receiving addresses. And no, none of those can lead someone to another one of those.\n\nAs for what they each do:\n\n* A public key can be used to keep track of your wallet from your phone, without actually allowing you to spend any BTC from that device. So you're not jeopardizing your security.\n\n* The private key is basically the wallet itself. If anyone has this, they have your money and can do as they please. Exercise caution and never give anyone this or your 24 word seed.\n\n* Receiving address is what you'll be handing out to people or using on websites to receive payment. Think of this as your email in PayPal: If someone wanted to PayPal $5, they'd need to send it to yourname@email.com. In Bitcoin, they'd have to send it to 1andreas3batLhQa2FawWjeyjCqyBzypd, for example.",

Its a device that has the ability to sign transactions with your private keys without exposing your private keys to the computer its connected to.  That is the whole point of a hardware wallet, to keep the private keys as secure as possible.\n\nKeeping a software wallet on a USB drive is arguably more secure than keeping it on an internet connected computer as long as the USB drive is only inserted during times of transactions... but it is still quite vulnerable to malware that might sit and wait for you to connect it.",

Yes, I see it as the same way you could have made money investing in coal mining technology several hundred years ago.\n\nGo check out Coinbase for a beginner friendly crypto buying and selling website. \n\nIn terms of spending money on it.

            "Text": "Given that fees to move bitcoin to your wallet are ~$14 at the moment, it doesn't make much sense to withdraw until you have a decent amount in the exchange, or you'll lose most of your money to the fees. If I were you, I'd wait until you had at least $200 in the exchange before withdrawing. Even then, you'd be losing around 5-10% in fees.\n\nSo, I'd choose a reputable exchange (my preference is Bitstamp), and enable as much security as they offer (two-factor auth in particular), and then keep doing your buys until you get to a point where a $14 transfer fee isn't a huge proportion of your investment. Then pull it out into a wallet.\n\nWhen you do pull it into the wallet, check [here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) to figure out a sensible fee to set, to make sure the transaction goes through in a sensible time. Don't be too stingy - you'll feel a lot worse watching that transaction sit in limbo wondering when it's going to arrive, than you will about the fee.\n\nAlso, some exchanges (Bitstamp & GDAX iirc, possibly among others) have zero fees to transfer bitcoin out. In which case, you have no reason not to pull out your bitcoins as soon as you have them, as long as you have no plans to sell anytime soon.",

No one in the Bitcoin community expected for things to literally explode like this and bog everything down.  The solutions that are being currently worked on are a long haul type of solutions that do not happen overnight. Looks like Bitcoin will be volatile for some time but the overall value of crypto will keep going up in the long run. No one knows at this point if Bitcoin will be the one that wins the world, but right now it has the strongest development support and the strongest brand. Once scaling technologies are fully adopted, more merchants will adopt crypto as a payment form and we will have a real revolution on our hands. ",

However, I think most people are now trying to find \"the next Bitcoin\". They want to find the next crypto which will have 1,000%+ annual gains. So, what you'll see is a slow and steady rise in Bitcoin while other coins have larger percentage gains. \nI know this is anecdotal, but my Father-in-law is a baby boomer and I just introduced him to the crypto world. He could care less about Bitcoin right now. He sees that 17k price tag and wants none of it. He saw Litecoin @ 100 USD, and bought a few and now he's tripled his money in just a few days. Now he's looking at things like Ripple and IOTA because they are cheap and he thinks he can afford $4 coins or $0.50 coins. And of course, he's right.. cause what if that $0.50 coin becomes $300+? \nAnd the longer Bitcoin goes without lightning, the more market share it will continue to bleed out to other crypto's which can handle the load and do transaction for less. \nSo as for me, I'm keeping the majority of my Crypto money in Bitcoin while also using some of the profit I've seen to invest in other crypto's just in case one of those ends up being the iPhone and Bitcoin the Blackberry.

Once you have your private key, you can use any app (including a \"paper wallet\") to gain access to your Bitcoin.  You are right, if someone accesses your phone and gets a hold of the seed words, they can use those words to \"restore\" your access to your Bitcoin and steal your Bitcoin by sending that Bitcoin to another private key they control. Most software wallets allow you to setup a PIN so that people need to also know that if they are to access your private key or seed words. You can also use a hardware wallet. Its essentially a USB device with a small screen which lets you display your seed words and your balance, etc.. It is used for \"offline\" storage so it is safer then a device that is constantly connected to the internet. You can delete the app, and reinstall it and restore your access via the seed words, but the seed words need to be stored in a secure place so that you don't lose your seed words, and that no one else can use them on your behalf.

I also do think another coin may unseat Bitcoin in the very long term, but I do not think it has been created yet.  None of the techs seem to be \"different enough\" or they have too great of other negatives that make them too high risk.\n\nPro's of alt-coins\n\n1. faster ability to implement changes due to generally centralized dev team\n2. generally some type of \"new tech\"\n\nCons of alt-coins:\n\n1. primary: unless you know the dev team personally, they may just bail on the project and sell all their premined coins. you will never have a warning of this. (same risk technically does exist in Bitcoin but none of them have Satoshi's hodl history)\n\n2. generally much higher centralization in many areas of the ecosystem (dev team, exchanges, holders of premined coins)\n3. higher risk of SEC activity focused on stopping progress\n\n4. no \"Bitcoin\" brandname to help spur mainstream adoption\n\n5. you need to consider carefully the premine and POW hash functions. Think about how the longterm may play out. Is a 51% attack possible? Feasible? is there motiviation for one? (i.e., would an attacker want to attack the network / hold hostage like a DDOS attack?)\n\nMany more pros and cons of both, just some key ones. if you calculate an invesmtent in all of hte alt-coins it will be terrible. A super high percentage have, are, and will go to 0.00 units by any measurement.\n\nAlso people forget that cryptos are just as much economic experiments as they are technology. Bitcoin has a large economic / social movemnet behind it (some others have really good ones too).",

This 'they don't understand the technology' bullshit is a dangerous mentality. Major investment banks and governments hire experts in all fields, including cryptos, to help them make informed decisions. Hence why more and more governments are trying to regulate the market before a correction fucks up their citizens and destabilizes their domestic economies. ",

            "Text": " Thanks\u2026 I honestly worry about the younger investors out there that are pouring every dime into this and eventually will get burned, especially short term. I actually hear people say that investing in the stock market is just like going to Vegas, and it\u2019s actually nothing like that. In the stock market you have an 80 to 90 percent chance of winning in every decadeBut you see people hoarding money in savings accounts because they\u2019re scared. A crazy speculative investment like this gives people a false perspective on what this world is really like. It\u2019s fun to have 20 percent daily gains, but it\u2019s not reality and eventually this will all calm down\u2026",

            "Text": "Thank you, your description of how crypto wallets work is the most comprehensive and easy to understand instructions I've ever laid my eyes on. \nThat said, I still don't get it. :( \nBUT I think I'm beginning to! My biggest take away from what you wrote is that a wallet doesn't actually store crypto currency, rather it is like a keychain that holds seeds/addresses/ secret words or w/e so that you can claim your crypto at a later date. \n\nSo, if I were to get a hardware \"wallet\" like Trezzor, I could send Bitcoin from an exchange to a public & unique address that the wallet produces? Is that public address visible on the wallet itself? Or does it need to be plugged into a PC? And would that public address look like the long string of characters like I've used to send Bitcoin to others before? IE \"235vjrifnv94824389etc\"? \nDoes that wallet then pair with a private address or code that appears like a string of characters like \"235vjrifnv94824389etc\"? Or is that private address or seed with the string of 12-24 words? \nSo then that private address will have ownership of that Bitcoin and the global blockchain ledger will record that I sent Bitcoin from an exchange to a public address associated with my wallet and my secret seed unlocks or authorizes my ownership of said Bitcoin? \n\nWhat if the wallet experiences a mechanical failure? Does it have to be plugged in to send or receive crypto? Or can it be sitting in a fire proof safe? What if someone steals the wallet? \nWhen is the string of 12-24 words revealed to me and is it ever possible to have it be displayed twice? Do the words appear on the device itself or on an application on your computer? \nIf the wallet is stolen, the thief can't access the Bitcoin without the phrase, correct?\nIn order for me to \"get my money back\" don't I have to reveal my secret phrase to a third party to prove ownership? Isn't that risky? \nI'm just trying to think of ways to safely store crypto long term and anything mechanical, digital, or if it uses a USB to connect makes me nervous. Who's to say that in 20-30 years trying to find a USB port would be like trying to find a floppy disc drive. \nI'm such a noob, please enlighten me! I've watched numerous Youtube videos and read a lot of instructions but I still don't get it. ",

They are very cautious around utilising hard forks for upgrades to the network and as I've understood, when a hard fork is necessary, they want to implement as many improvements as possible into one upgrade, e.g. Schnorr signatures, MAST, etc. \n\nAre you familiar with the security arguments for hard fork vs soft fork for upgrades? Because my impression is, that is where the majority of the technical arguments rest when it comes to even just modest blocksize increases. \n",

            "Text": "In general centralizing is kind of bad depending on your perspective of course... but what is most important is that centralization does not happen at the base layer (Bitcoin network).  If the bottom layers are centralized then you cannot regain decentralization on the higher up layers.  Reality is there is already some layer 2 centralization.  Those are what we call Exchanges today.  They are essentially a layer 2 centralized Bitcoin application.  Billions of dollars of Bitcoin can be traded on these exchanges without a single transaction hitting the Bitcoin blockchain.  They are just trading IOU notes that are really backed by nothing.  Lightning at least makes those transactions backed by actual Bitcoin that nobody can cheat anybody out of and run off with.\n\nHaving \"Payment Hubs\" with Lightning is not required, I personally just think its something that is likely to happen... because as you are already thinking about, opening and closing channels with every vendor could be costly and cumbersome.  The hope is that hubs are not really needed that much and that things really go alot more peer to peer, but hubs could also prove valuable too.  THey could put a completely new spin on how things like brand / store loyalty cards work or give financial incentives to \"buy local\" type movements.\n\nRegulation is coming to Bitcoin, there is really already lots here, it shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing.  Regulation brings legitimization, which helps widen the user base.",

            "Text": "> Like, my understanding is that the sequence of letters and numbers IS the bitcoin.\n\nThe amount of bitcoin you have is just a number represented by a series of bits, just like any other number in a computer.  That number is backed up by the crypto algorithms and hashes in the blockchain, meaning nobody can just randomly change the amount of bitcoin they own to just any amount.\n\nTo get a little more complicated, what is actually being tracked is not how much bitcoin you have, but which transactions into your wallet have not been used as output transactions yet.  Each transaction stores the amount that has changed hands as well as where it came from and where it went.  So for a wallet to calculate how much bitcoin it has, it must add up the value of all unused input transactions.   Transactions can't be created out of thin air.  For you to send money to somebody, you have to reference which input transactions you are using to send money to them.  Any change is sent back as a return transaction.  This creates a chain of transactions that are all linked together in a giant web.\n\n[This video helped me understand how all of this works, as well as mining and preventing double spending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE)\n\n> But then how do you deal with partial bitcoins??\n\nThe internal software all deals in satoshis (the smallest denomination of a bitcoin).  Presumably, this is to avoid having to run more complex floating point calculations.  The display software just shifts the decimal point to show the value in some other measurement (whole bitcoins, mBTC, or any value you want really).",

I believe Bitstamp has a slightly more solid reputation than GDAX. I think both will require you to go through a verification process involving sending scans of your ID. I had to do this for Bitstamp. So it's swings and roundabouts, and up to you :) No harm getting accounts on both, if you feel like it.\n\nAs for iOS wallets, I'm an android man, so not the best person to ask. From what I've heard, Breadwallet is the most popular, but Green supports SegWit, which means that fees sending from it should be 30-40% lower.",

So bottom line is that you won't lose your coins, worst case is they're on a 2 week vacation.",

            "Text": "I'll do my best:\n\nRight now, typical transaction fees for a reasonable confirmation time are `> 200` Satoshis/byte.  A Satoshi is `1/100,000,000` BTC, and a typical transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs is about `250` bytes, so a fee for a typical transaction is `250*200=50,000` Satoshis.  As I type, Bitcoin is trading at about `$16,500`/BTC, so `50,000/100,000,000*$16,500=$8.25` per transaction.\n\nBecause of the way that Bitcoin transactions are constructed, adding more source transactions adds more bytes to the transaction, meaning that right now anything in your wallet that was sent in batches less than about $8.25 is unspendable.\n\nThe chart that I linked is one possible way to monitor current network transaction fees.  Using it, you can deduce that there have been times in the past week where transactions between 50 and 70 Satoshi/byte were clearing, that's 4x lower than current fees, and would enable you to lose only about $2 per input transaction int he process of moving your Bitcoin.\n\nTransactions originating from SegWit addresses cost about 1/2 as many bytes as those originating from `legacy` addresses.  Based on what you're saying, I'm assuming that your current wallet is not using SegWit addresses.\n\n* So, first thing you should do is download a wallet that supports SegWit, this is the hard part, because many do not yet support it. Don't use GreenAddress for this (even though their wallet is excellent and supports SegWit) because it uses multisig, which also increases tx costs. A quick glance at the internet tells me that Armory might be a good option, but I haven't used it, so can't personally vouch.\n* If your current wallet doesn't support custom fees, export its private key, and import it into one that does.\n* Set a custom fee of between 50 and 70 Satoshis/byte, and send all of your coin to a new SegWit address. It might take a week or more to get there, but it will either get there or revert, and if it reverts, you can try again with a slightly higher fee in a few weeks. You'll lose probably $6-7 total, but your coin will consolidated, and _most_ of the value will be spendable.\n\nedit: formatting",

USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, and now XBT (Bitcoins official currency trading symbol).\n\n>imaginary, untangible money\n\nMost money in my country exists only on the computer. There is a lot of physical cash, but more exists as created by the banking system in general (Look up \"M0\" money supply)\n\n>What if the whole system goes tits up?\n\nBetter question to ask is *how*. The worlds largest nations cannot take it down, it's decentralized. Quantum computing? If that cracks the bitcoin code, it also cracks every bank, government, military encryption there is. Satoshi comes back from the dead and dumps his coins? Price tanks, millions of little fish get to eat up the cheaper coins.\n\nThis sounds cliche, but really it comes to this: Fiat is backed by the government that issues it. Bitcoin is backed by the sheer number of people using it. And the more it gets used, the stronger and more stable it will become. This is the first step towards a truly global currency, and has the potential to unseat the USD/EUR/GBP etc as the reserve currency for the world.",

            "Text": "AVLights06, There are so many crypto currency options that it can make your head spin and there isn't enough time in the day to research them all. Andreas Antonopoulos (look him up if you haven't already) was asked which one's to avoid and he basically said if there are 1,000 coins, 900 of them are probably terrible. \nI look at the market today and I think it's wise to diversify to a point. My plan is to basically follow the top 5-10 crypto's according to market cap. I believe for someone like myself who is just getting started, this is a good way to avoid junk coins and limiting risk because they have already been \"tested\" and shown to succeed. If you want to compare that approach to the stock market, It would be like tracking the S&P 500 which has shown to be a good choice in the \"old\" way of handling finance. \nSo if Bitcoin is 65% of the total market cap, then put 65% of your crypto portfolio into Bitcoin. If Ethereum is 25%, put 25% in there and so on. This way if one of the other currencies ends up being the innovator that beats the original (which History has shown to happen). You can have a piece of that. As much faith as I have in Bitcoin, I wouldn't want to have all my eggs in one basket. \nOh, and if you really just want to explore small amounts of money into speculative investing, then invest in coins that offer solutions to problems currently facing the bigger coins and or the tried and true method: Pick coins based on strength of name or buy every coin below X value in USD like a penny stock. \nEven if Bitcoin fails, crypto currency is the future so be sure to pick the winning horse!

Please please do not store your coins on an exchange : )\n\nBut to your other question, depositing/withdrawing BTC to/from gdax couldn't be simpler. Go to your \"accounts\" tab on Gdax (top right of page), and you'll see your balances of USD, BTC, ETH, and LTC. Each balance has a little \"down arrow\" for deposits. Clicking that button just gives you an \"address\" that will allow you to send the relevant fund type to your GDAX account. The \"up arrow\" is to withdraw your funds, and you'll enter an \"address\" you get from another location.\n\nEdit: You log into GDAX with the same login credentials as Coinbase. Moving coins/funds between the two locations is even simpler than using the \"address\" system because they are the same company, just with a different \"face\" and different fees/uses.",

This is where I would agree that their primary motivation is controlling their citizens with an iron fist.\n\nIt is also the case, however, that a sharp correction in the bitcoin market would ruin the lives of countless Chinese citizens. That is the kind of economic destabilization that undermines Communist Party rule and cannot be tolerated.\n\nEven if the rationale is primarily based in a desire to maintain control, it is predicated in fears of what might happen if the bubble pops. The Chinese don't make decisions without careful consideration and likely decided that the market was not resting on a solid foundation. ",

Your GTX 1080 will do more, but probably at a slightly higher cost of electricity. You'll still get more in return than you spend on electricity, unless it's crazy expensive where you live.\n\nBitcoin is pointless to GPU mine because of ASIC's being vastly superior in terms of hashrate.

But for the moment cryptocurrencies seem to be benefiting the few with insight (or luck) much like the early domainer days (Frank Schilling et al) when everybody was up in Vancouver getting rich from ad clicks. I'm not being critical here. Its just, granted there is work involved in mining etc - back in 1994 you couldn't just *buy*, say, 1% *of the entire fintech future*.

            "Text": "The bitcoin is \"stored\" in the distributed blockchain, which is public, and has thousands of copies worldwide. Your wallet contains the cryptographic keys to allow you to spend it. So destroying the wallet doesn't destroy the bitcoin - it only destroys your ability to get to it.\n\nThe keys are derived from that 12/24-word seed, so as long as you have that, you can recreate the wallet on any software that supports the \"HD\" wallet standard.\n\nSo yes, if your phone is destroyed tomorrow, all you would have to do is put that 12/24 word seed into another compatible wallet app, and it will be as if nothing had ever happened. All your transactions and balances will be there again.\n\nBut keep the seed words very secret, because if someone finds them out, they can also recreate your wallet and steal the money.",

            "Text": "So here is something that is a very common misconception.\n\nBitcoin is not stored in a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nAll Bitcoin is really just entries in a public ledger (the blockchain) that states what amount of Bitcoin currently belongs to every Bitcoin address in existence.\n\nThe private key is what is required in order to spend entries in the ledger that belong to your addresses.  The private keys allow you to make new entries in the ledger to spend your coins and assign them to a new address.\n\nWhere it gets really special... a receiving address, despite the fact that your wallet might display it to you, is COMPLETELY unknown to the Bitcoin network until somebody actually sends coins to it.  Up to that point, the address only exists in your wallet.\n\nThat means you can actually do things like generate Bitcoin addresses / private keys completely offline and have somebody send Bitcoin to that address even though you created it offline and never connected it to the Bitcoin blockchain yourself.  Hell, if you really really wanted to, you could actually generate a Bitcoin public and private keys using nothing more than a piece of paper and a pencil if you are capable of doing all the math behind it yourself.  \n\nSo to answer your question... yes Bitcoin in a sense is always online despite your wallet being on or offline.  Somebody could send Bitcoins to an address you have only stored on a piece of paper and it can sit there for years until you decide to spend that Bitcoin using the associated private key and broadcasting a transaction to the network.",

Sure, fees are high but thatdoesn't bother people who are investing as opposed to transacting so that's nbd.

But of course bitcoin wouldnt use a 'rsa supplier' they'd generate their own.  But it's still kind of created this distrust of RSA in crypto circles, they like AES and ECC more.  Also I think RSA has a history of being brute forced every 10 years or so due to moore's law.  So they keep increasing the key size.  And people are always paranoid of 'key space reduction' attacks.\n\nI only 'kinda' know what im talking about here, tbh.\n\n",

            "Text": "Yes, you need a wallet program for each type of crypto. Never try to send one type of crypto to an address for another type of crypto by accident. For example, bitcoin and bitcoin cash are two different coins!\n\nMake sure your computer is secure by the way. If you're storing coins in a wallet on your computer and your computer has a virus you money could easily be stolen. Many people have a separate computer they use only for their digital wallets and absolutely no other purpose. Make sure you have a paper backup of every wallet you have also. You need the seed or private key to access your money should your computer become dead. You need a physical piece of paper to serve as a backup to the wallet on your computer.\n\nDo your research and be careful. I see people post all the time about losing tens of thousands of dollars. Take your time and learn. If you're unsure about something learn more about it before you move forward with a wallet or a transaction.",

Or just sell your whole rig with a discount locally or something. You will lose some $$$ when you sell, but think of it as an investment and \"rental\" fee.\n\nCheck /r/EtherMining for any info on that. They're probably happy now that ETH is up.",
