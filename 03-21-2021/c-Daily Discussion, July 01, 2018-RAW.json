            "Text": "Right now every change is being broadcast across the network (Gossip protocol, BOLT 7), so nodes know where the tracks are at every moment. With that knowledge a route gets built and a train is fired, going one track segment at a time. If the tracks disappeared, the train would bounce back to origin and another route would be tried. There is no case where the train would vanish with the tracks - either the channel is closed after an HTLC passes it, or it would close before it reaches it and won't be attempted.\n\nThere are two problems with this.\n\nOne, a node have to be online all the time to monitor changes or have to spend a minute downloading the network state on each start. Plenty of channels sit there unchanged for a while, but over days enough changes would accumulate to make the stale network data almost useless.\n\nThe second problem is that current implementations don't handle nodes vanishing mid-flight all that well, the case where the station disappears while the train is at it, rather than just the tracks. In that case your money can get stuck for days in the time locks. It's quite rare, but still a problem to be solved.",

It could take years to moon again to the point it changes lives.   \n\nFollow the golden rule not to invest more than you can afford to lose and you have no reason to fear.   \n\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso want to add, if you are facing debt and financial troubles you should listen to Dave Ramsey. He can really help you out. \n\nDave is full of shit when it comes to bitcoin though.  Everyone who has money to invest in a 401k or ira should be at least putting in a few percent in bitcoin.

Demand is backed by an ever-fluctuating price, and the blockchain that runs it requires miners and energy to secure transactions.  The fact that bitcoin is finite only augments the value that is put in to create it (out of thin air)...\n\nSpeaking of thin air, how's fiat currency valid and backed? Not to mention, the exponentially larger amount of resources required to create it (out of thin air), store it, transport it, distribute/disperse, and corrupt it. ",

As the software to improve Bitcoin is being upgraded there is an ongoing contribution of code added to the open source process. This code is reviewed and tested, and so forth. \n\nIn this digital age it's surprising that there are still so many people that have not yet adapted to the concept of technology and today's digital value. The properties to work efficiently as a digital currency and store of value and the public acceptance are not advanced quite enough yet for many to envision where this is headed. \n\nBut it's time to stop the \"no value\" claims. Think for a second about some of the things we place value on. Now think about the coders, miners, hardware and software that will be created to improve mining, the jobs it will create, the traders and investors, the infrastructure, how it's impacting countries all over the world, our financial news, and I could go on. \n\nNow ask yourelf again, compared to some of the ridiculous things we 'value' in the world of commerce, is it fair to say Bitcoin has no value?",

Sure, the cost has been artificially inflated by mining complexity but the value to user has not changed much.  LN is a great technology but has delivered little real tangible value.\n\nThat is why a lot of people are saying that BTC is a bubble.  A bubble is when the price has risen disproportionately to it's value.  And for BTC to rise 10x last year with no real increase in underlying value - that is a bubble by any definition.",
