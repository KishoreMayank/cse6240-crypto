Kind of feels like what many of us are are experiencing these days:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Posted by u/pro-gram  2 years ago  \n>  \n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>Does anyone else feel conflicted on the price falling, and not skyrocketing, since now we can buy more?  \n>  \n>&nbsp;\n>   \n>I, like most smart people, have a bi-weekly buy on Bitcoin. This is what you do if you believe in Bitcoin in the long term for many reasons so you don't over commit your funds trying to time to market. One such reason I believe in Bitcoin is due to its usecase of being a great store of value that finally puts money back in your hands after it was ruthlessly attempted to be controlled by the Big Banks over the past couple decades. Fucking fees for everything. Fees for holding your money, fees for sending, fees for checking your money fees for... FUCK YOU FUCKING BANKS FUCK YOU!  \n>  \n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>Now, poor folks who had no chance at even getting a bank account (usually after they get charged 200$+ in fees and blacklisted from banks) can once again enter the digital economy and not have to worry about middlemen saying they can't. Hooray for poor people! The cool thing is kids these days, even if they turn out poor, are smart enough with computers to be able to utilize Bitcoin as a bank in the future once it becomes more mainstream.  \n>  \n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>The bottom line is this is one of the major reasons I am confident in Bitcoin in the long term, and why I want to continue to put a consistent amount of money in it as its my new fucking Bank!

How **else** did you expect it to possibly go down? Do you believe the world will sing songs of friendship as bitcoin pierces the $10k level, and then the $100k level? No. It's going to be a Zapp Brannigan scale catastrophe. And as this current wave of crypto-cooling finally draws to an end, the next titanic swelling of interest won't be laid on top of a chorus of songs about friendship and magic.

With such a new financial universe the early movements were rapid and violent, even though they were comparatively small in the global scheme of things. But as the financial universe of cryptocurrency grows we can expect to see those major movements grow less frequent over time *while increasing in real-world intensity*. It just looks a little dismal at the moment because our latest (and longest) movement was a downward one from the recent hype peak of late 2013.  \n>  \n>&nbsp;\n>   \n>Remember that? Everyone was talking about crypto; it was on the news, and random animal based altcoins were popping up everwhere. We went from 20 cryptocurrencies to over 1,000.

I'm very confident that it's coming but unless some ETF news or huge incentive to drive hype comes along it realistically has to take time, as the framework creates easy acquisition and onboarding.

Not of huge value I suspect, maybe worth 4 figures in USD in late 2017.\n\nBut then you got greedy, and went heavily into altcoins (shitcoins) which seemed to be climbing faster, and you have been severely burnt.\n\nMany of them are down around 95%.\n\nIt has been your mission since then to troll forums looking for justification for your poor decisions.\n\nThis is quite a happy forum - we don't need your advice.

What bugs me is that these benefits worked just as well (maybe even better) when bitcoin was in the $20-$100 range. The actual use cases of BTC don't justify the price we're currently at. It's all just speculators and whales using smoke and mirrors to somehow justify the valuation we're at.",

Since every wallet can even use a different random generated address every time? I read few times that this doesn\u2019t matter and still can be traced, but I am not sure I understand how.\n\nAnd the benefit for this kind of international transfers is unbelievably valuable to many people (including me) where every single transaction has to be supported by documents and then given a period to be reviewed, then another 5-7 days to be received, and in few times it didn\u2019t reach, what\u2019s the action from the bank side? Started an investigation that takes up to 30 days! And trust me they will use every day of those 30!\n\nHowever unfortunately till now I am not able to use that, the other day we were thinking seriously of doing that between company branches in different countries, unfortunately we couldn\u2019t because the price is changing dramatically, and that on both side we need it to be in fiat. And that\u2019s a lot of work for the amount we were sending.\n\nYeah I am in for anything that helps me getting the banks out of my life.\n",

The way to do that is to keep the market cap at the same trading volume, but increasing and decreasing the supply to demand. \n\nUsing the word moron when you don't understand how something works is pretty indicative of your willingness to understand. \n\nWhat do you think happens when the market cap of tether goes down? That means people are moving out of tether and back in to crypto. This isn't that hard to comprehend. ",

(other than cost trillions of dollars)?\n\ndefinitely no evidence of that, at all. none.\n\nnow, what if we spent the same money we currently spend trying to \"cure\" global warming, and instead spent it on real environmental issues like cleaning up water and air pollution (real pollution that is, not just the naturally occurring gas CO2) ...would that be a better use of our limited financial resources?\n\nYes, of course it would be better to fight real pollution, as opposed to the made up \"danger\" of CO2 gas.\n\nGlobal warming (or \"global cooling\" or \"climate change\" or whatever else they are calling it this week) is just a ploy by big govt leftists to gain greater power, and to collect even more taxes, and to self-enrich themselves in the process.\n\nThe leftists at the top who are pushing global warming alarmism don't really care about the environment, if they did they wouldn't spread this lie, Additionally, , spreading this lie destroys our economy, and removes our freedoms.\n\nLuckily, global warming is considered a joke by anyone with a brain who looks into it.\n\nYour average rank and file low-information voter does honestly think that the fake global warming alarmist theories are true, so they incorrectly think that supporting the global warming manipulators like al gore is the right thing to do.\n\nwe (who are truly educated on the reality of the global warming hoax) now know the truth, its just a matter of educating the rest of the public to the truth about al gore and the rest of his lying leftist ilk.\n\np.s if you want to educate yourself on this subject, a great resource to check out is www.climatedepot.com\n\nanother good one is https://realclimatescience.com\n\nbut do YOUR OWN research, look at ALL the sources, and you'll soon discover the truth on your own\n\n",

You're really clueless.\n\nWhen BTC's price starts dropping Bitfinex \"print\" more tether because more people are moving in to it, thus the demand of tether increases, in order to keep the price at $1.00 you need to increase the supply. How do you increase the supply? You print more tether.\n\nTether isn't propping up the price, it makes no sense that people selling bitcoin would prop the price up. Clearly you're missing something very fundamental about how market dynamics work.\n\nPlease tell me you don't actually believe that a \"printed\" currency is keeping bitcoin afloat. Who is accepting this printing currency in order to keep the price of bitcoin high?\n\nThis is the poorest FUD out there and is akin to flat earth theory and other such hogwash.\n\nEdit - You literally just said that when the price drops more tether is printed. That seems like the more tether there are the more bitcoin price decreases. Please think about your own statement.",

            "Text": "> You definitely shifted your argument by backpedaling then doubling down\n\nnope, not at all\n\nnot even one iota\n\nstop saying untrue things.\n\nand hey... i am with you 100% in regard to following and developing economically viable alternative energy sources\n\nthey are great\n\nits just that making up a play-pretend imaginary \"problem\" like global warming as the reason is just silly.\n\n>So the consensus is based on the non-existent evidence that has been collected by scientists on how our world is changing? So, ice core sampling, sea level measurements, and temperature recording isn't actually data?\n\nugh, first of all, consensus isn't science, secondly (as i said before) \n\"has the earth ever naturally cooled or warmed?\nyes, it always has\"\n\ni'm not denying that climate changes, i am simply saying its not a big deal, and the so-called \"solutions\" haven't been show to have any effect, other than being incredibly expensive and freedom-limiting.\n\nso regrardes of what opinion is the most popular, that doesnt make the fear mongering of global warming alarmists something that we should take seriously\n\ni remember reading a poll that said the majority of Americans believe in angels, is that now scientific proof of the existence of angels?\n\nof course not, majority opinion and scientific reality are not the same thing.\n\n....................\n\n\nthe strangest thing, to me, is why so many like you fight for belief in global warming alarmism?\n\n...as opposed to actually researching all the information on the subject.\n\nseriously, most global warming alarmists have a belief systems that are seemingly more aligned with a religious belief systems than the scientific method",

The Tether market cap expands and deflates right on par with the movement in and out of Bitcoin, as a source of  liquidity to enable fast pace trades. There are issues that tether creates, yes, the enabling of pump and dumps being the main one. But pump and dump trading only hurts those who are gullible enough to fall for it. ",
