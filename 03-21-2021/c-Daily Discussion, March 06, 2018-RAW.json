Give it time buckos, you'll get to a point where a $2000 drop or gain in either direction doesn't even make you blink. \n\nAnd you think this is 'tough'? When BTC is around $50,000 you're going to see swings of $5000 - $7000 in a day. \n\nDon't go full Carlos with the \"WHATTTTAMMMMIGONNADOOOOO??!\" shit. Just enjoy the ride. Nothing you ever invest in in your life will bring you these highs and lows the way Bitcoin will. Be thankful you're living through this. \n\n",

Then I finally figure \"screw it, it's Tuesday\" and moved everything into their wallets. Hours later... Boom!\n\nHowever, now that BTC has dropped I kinda feel that I don't need to look at the charts every 5 minutes wondering what it's going to do.\n\nI'm not gonna play the Tether game because I seem to mostly make crap decisions. I guess I'll just hold everything through this and see what happens on the weekly rather than focus on the hourly. I haven't invested what I can't afford and I'm in this for the long-game.\n\nI guess my biggest fear is that these \"normal\" dips make people leave the Crypto Market. Maybe better education/awareness of Crypto can prepare young investors what to expect. But that's a whole new thread.",

            "Text": "My *newbie* observations:  Firstly, people want to HODL, they want to not focus on market conditions. They'd rather wait as they have a belief that the coin's value will rise to a super high. However that HODL dream is disrupted by the day traders who only care about making money every day. They will buy on what they see is the day's low then sell on the day's high. However this selling disrupts the HODL dream. The only way the day traders will HODL is if there is a serious momentum behind it as with the mainstream media of late 2017.  \n\nWith all these fluctuations it makes me wonder if the predictions of $1million or even $50K are actually realistic?",

            "Text": "Well, it sure ain't a \"techy\" forum.  People are not here out of love for the technology.  Everyone here either wants/hopes/needs to make some $$$.  That means everyone either (a) regrets selling too soon on a rally, (b) buying right before a dip or correction, (c) wishes they had more money to gamble, or (d) has developed an unhealthy obsession for shinny objects - which this sub provides hourly.\n\nOnce in again there are some great comments about TA (which in crypto is really like palm reading).  Other times there some classically comical stories, etc.  A handful of over used inside jokes (e.g. \"Hey guys, I am selling... prepare for the rally\").\n\nTruth be told, being here posting away probably keeps most of these folks well on the road to recovery - and away from their past of internet porn addictions.  (think methadone for heroin)  Why else all the green dildo references?\n\nBut asking a sub full of \"shills\" or \"bots\" for a recommendation for a quality sub elsewhere may be a little like asking where to get directions to the hidden city in Atlas Shrugged.  (meaning, you have to know how to get there on your own).\n\nAs for me, I am with the bots.  Boop, beep, boop.  See everyone in the AM when this has taken a dump to 10k even.",

When I finally came back, i was right back where I started - except I wasn't feeling bad about the drop!  Sure I missed out on what could have been some nice gains... but I also missed out on the equivalent of a FUD induced stop-loss... and I got a week of my life back while I wasn't at the keyboard.",

            "Text": "Neither? Let's stop right here and take a couple 100 feet back. Read up on how to properly store and secure cryptocurrencies before you get in to this space. If you are talking about a few hundred dollars on coinbase or gemini, then fine, keep it there (since it is FDIC insured). If you are putting a significant amount of wealth into this please store it on a wallet where you CONTROL the private keys (not password, the private cryptographic keys). Couple ways to do this is to use a hardware wallet like the Ledger S Nano, or Desktop client like the actual bitcoin core client, I also believe the Bread wallet on iOS is a place you have your own private key. Note: Just like keeping cash, if you misplace your public key (i.e., lose/forget it) you will lose you money. Learn to back up and practice safe password keeping habits. ",

You should analyze charts yourself and do some research though, in the end no one fucking knows.",

            "Text": "My view... this is a down trend; so that upward trend line is pointless. At the 11,600 area, we needed large bullish volume to break through resistance. Because we failed, we now have a new trend. We'll test supports at 9,400 and 8,400-8,000 and finally a hard test of the bottom. Whichever support succeeds means we're probably back in business.\n\nJust my thoughts. I'm a TA wizard touching his crystal balls. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nEdit: Normally I'd say this is a smaller correction, but the volume of selling makes me think down trend.",

The best thing for bitcoin as a currency would be a stable price, fast transactions, low fees, and widespread merchant support. \n\nThat's a tall order.\n\nSpeed and fees relies on lightning network living up to the hype. Merchant adoption relies on price stability, lightning network, and enough buyers to convince them to continue accepting bitcoin. \n\nRight now people just want to hodl and speculate on price. This is great if bitcoin is nothing more than a casino, but if there's _any_ chance of it becoming a mainstream currency people will need to venture out into the real world and spend their bitcoin.\n\nHave you looked at one of those \"bitcoin accepted here\" directories? The ones I've found are very outdated and 95% of the merchants listed on there no longer accept bitcoin (especially the local ones).\n\nEveryone is excited about reaching a new ATH but, really, that's one of the worst possible things for bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n",

Should have sold before I left but was in a hurry and a bit greedy. \n\nIt appears to be bottoming out btw. Oversold on the 15 m rsi and trending bullish, stoch rsi has it close to overbought. We are going to bounce around in the mid 10800 - 10900s today.  Buy and sell fractional - you might make $5 per thousand risked, and on volatile days you can make that several times over.\n\nNow, someone can come dump on you, don't be lazy like me and leave yourself exposed for an hour. Don't risk a lot, and you can't lose a lot. Can't make a lot either,  but the point is to make a little at a time. Don't risk your profits either. Don't panic - buy and sell clear trends, and when the price ignores those trends limit losses and wait for it to level out. BTC is not an efficient market. You only need to make a few dollars at a time.\n\nI'm in the middle of writing a bot so I can catch pennies rather than $ relying upon limit maker orders typed by hand, so my swings can be a bit more level and profits steadier.",

Those are just the odds.  By contrast, in stocks, the majority of the time you actually can wait out a price drop - if you otherwise have enough liquidity to get along.  Here in crypto-world we are really somewhere in between.  Sort of gambling, sort of investing.\n\nBut if you really think BTC will go to zero, it is odd that you spend time here.  Its a bit too hopeful for that schadenfreud moment - with total strangers no less.\n\nYour comment also presupposes a \"one and done\" philosophy.  Someone takes the pains to buy in the first place... just to lock-in a loss with a stop... and then walks away never to return.\n\nNobody on this sub is a one-and-done.  Once folks know themselves - or at least what their own behavior will be - it becomes really, really silly to panic and sell.\n\nWhat, sell so you only lose part of your money?  But then buy again tomorrow?  Stop losses really only work for folks that are sophisticated enough to catch falling knifes... which most folks here are not (I'm sure not).",

If you are a \"buy today\" and check back in a year or two.... then definitely get off the exchange and put in a secure wallet.  But in all reality, most everyone here is trading.  Maybe not every hour, or even every day, but probably at least once a week or so.  If you keep taking money off exchanges and putting it back, you will pay a decent amount in fees (since most exchanges charge you to take $$$ off the exchange).  A percent here and a percent there starts adding up if you really are trading.",

I've been through mt gox, I was elated to see Bitcoin crack 1000, I was dismayed when it went down around 200. I just kept hodling though. This past year has been amazing, and is the beginning of what many of us thought was possible all along. And it is still just the beginning. But there is a bunch of you talking about getting out of Bitcoin because the price just can't sustain?!?!! It's at fucking 10k, that's incredible! And take a look at the price chart for past 5 years, what does that tell you? It tells me 100k is possible, it also shows me that it takes time. Not that much time in the scheme of things, but years. Please, people, stop trying to make a buck off what it's worth today and what it's worth tomorrow. I personally do not believe that's where the real money is. And stress will give you a heart attack. Don't cry about daily price fluctuations. Look at the big picture.",

Buy low, sell high, don't get emotionally attached. This is a jungle and you will get eaten if you don't use sense. What goes up must come down. We are in a bear market, hopefully close to the end but until we see more volume, the price will be manipulated by big players. You can profit by watching closely and following the herd. A pullback was expected. When that huge sell came, I sold and am buying in slowly starting now. You can Hodl for the long term but then you miss out on a chance to acquire more coins/fiat. It takes work but you can make money even in a bear market. good luck!",

            "Text": "It's a threshold that it's difficult for price to breach, think of it as a barrier price. There are many points of resistance and points of support. Whenever resistance breaks, it automatically becomes support and reverse. \n\nImagine it like this, for an instance there is a situation where price is going up nicely but there is fuckton of guys that want to cash out and make a profit on like~~ 13k level. So they will all place sell orders that will create a resistance line for the buyers that need to \"outbuy\" them and more to cross it for the price to continue going up. Otherwise price bounces back, obviously it could also float there for a while et cetera.\n\nThis is the most simplistic explanation, anyways, for bitcoin there are couple more special levels than the others, you need to look at the history chart to see when price struggled the most to decide its worth. For bitcoin the most important point is 12k level, because it'd give technical evidence that bear trend was reversed and many people would step in, resulting in the price going to atleast 13k and probably even 14.2k but then there are many barriers to pass on the way so no one can know for sure.",

It might dip quickly below 10,400, meet 10,200 and move up; I don't think anyone can say which support and fib line will hold though. I will say fibs don't usually reverse trends until at least below 38%.\n\nWe're @14:00 and very low on RSI so we'll likely see some small (1-2%) push back as we did @09:00.",

We're probably gunna be in a flat/bearish market until April or May to be honest, that runup to 19K was retarded and now we're paying for it.\n\nEvery time it's tried to break 12K it happens at point of weakness where buyers are already exhausted to some degree.  It'll be a fresh wave that'll crack it, not a stretched out one that's close to needing to correct.",
