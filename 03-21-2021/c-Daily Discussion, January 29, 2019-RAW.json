            "Text": "The amount of bitcoin these days one can buy with fiat is dwindling so much compared to a few years ago. If you are investing at the current bitcoin price one bitcoin would take let's say $3500 USD to acquire as an example. Compared to a few years ago one could have bought one bitcoin for let's say $200 USD.\n\nIs it time we actually start pricing in satoshi/something with a smaller denomination? Imagine telling the average Joe to buy one share of Berkshire Hathaway class A. There is no way they can do it and it sounds absurd. Companies do stock splits all the time to make shares more available to the investor. I am aware bitcoin is divisible thus people won't need to buy one whole coin at a time, but will it reach the stage where we should switch to a smaller denomination that makes it sound easier to acquire?",

I have to give them some credit for effort:\n\n&nbsp;\n&#x200B;\n>Hello,  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>  \n>In 2018, Gemini engaged with Big Four auditor Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) to execute a SOC 2\u00ae - SOC for Service Organizations Type 1 examination. After months of preparation and an in-depth external review, we are pleased to announce that Gemini has successfully completed its SOC 2 Type 1 examination. This makes Gemini the ***world\u2019s first cryptocurrency exchange and custodian to demonstrate this level of security compliance in protecting customer data and funds.***   \n>\n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>Providing you with a safe and secure platform to buy, sell, and store your cryptocurrency is paramount to our mission to ***build the future of money***. In the traditional financial and technology industries, SOC 2 reviews have become an industry standard for demonstrating security compliance. Our SOC 2 review \u2014 coupled with our digital asset insurance \u2014 is another step we\u2019ve taken towards raising the bar for consumer protection, safeguards, and industry best practices. \u00a0  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n> \n>Gemini\u2019s exchange and custody platform was built with a \u201csecurity-first\u201d mentality from the start. Continuing that approach, Deloitte performed an independent evaluation of the design and implementation of Gemini's security controls. These controls have been independently inspected to meet the trust services criteria set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). This included a review of Gemini\u2019s exchange application, infrastructure, and underlying customer database, as well as its institutional-grade cryptocurrency storage system that custodies the private keys of Gemini\u2019s online and offline wallets.\u00a0  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>We feel strongly that this standard of compliance is what all retail and institutional consumers should expect of their cryptocurrency exchange and custodian. We know what\u2019s at stake when you trade and store crypto. That is why, in addition to our SOC 2 Type 1 review, we are also committed to obtaining our SOC 2 Type 2 review in 2019. This additional level of assurance will further validate the effectiveness of our internal controls.  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n> \n>Going forward, we will perform a SOC 2 examination on an annual basis in order to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to safeguarding your data and cryptocurrency.\u00a0  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n> \n>For questions, please reach out to [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com).  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>Onward and Upward,  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n> \n>Yusuf Hussain, Head of Risk\n\n&#x200B;",

As more and more unefficient miners get out of this that could actually go lower.\n\nIf you're going to look at a metric the network value to transaction is probably a better one than mining.\n\nIf we have a capitulation bottom it's going to be obvious you're going to see things sell off and you're going to see people panicking and forced to sell. It's highly possible that some large hands want to see bitmain broken and the bch project destroyed. this would land a lot of stability to Bitcoin in general as they have been the most toxic asset in the space. I said this in another post but there are literally two smart ways to play Bitcoin right now. One of them is by when we decisively close over 6,000. The other is wait for a capitulation event or capitulation bottom to actually form. You want the price to go down to a lower level on extremely high volume and then rock it back up. The chart in February 2018 is actually what capitulation looks like even though that one was not the actual bottom. Having something like that happen again really increases the odds that we have hit a bottom. You have the massive percentage decrease and you also have the technical capitulation which means people are forced to sell. I seriously think breaking roger and bitmain are likely primary goals of this bear Market. It's always going to be a thorn in the side if we recover and they are still around",

Sunk capital cost doesn't matter in the short term.  So a miner might have to sell their coins BELOW their true costs (which will include capital allocation costs.)  \n\nSo in a price down turn, some are in survival mode and since their capital costs are unrecoverable, they still mine to keep cash flow, hoping that either difficulty drops or price increases.  \n\nAs long as their cash flow is marginally positive and their debt is not being collected, they can keep going for awhile.  \n\nThis is a compounding effect to low prices.  The lower the prices, the more desperate is the need for miners to sell until enough ultimately just give up or mothball operations.  \n\nThis overall compounds the normal boom bust cycles of a speculative asset.

Basically, a doomsday prepper.\n\nI don't believe either will happen. This sub is filled with hilarious nonsense of pumping up bitcoin. The huge price rise in 2017 had a lot of people talking about bitcoin. Basically everyone knows what it is now. Next to nobody actually wants to use it.\n\nThe terrifying thing about this sub is that I think a lot of people have been brainwashed and are spending a lot of money investing in bitcoin.

It might benefit you to ask a few questions before judging because you clearly have missed something about Bitcoin in the noise you have decided to focus on.

I think it will...\n\nIn the past as the price went up, there is a lag of time before new hashrate (miners) can enter the market.  This reduced competition relative to the reward makes mining very profitable and this continues as long as the price is rising.  This attracts new hashrate.  Bitcoin has high utility potential and growing real use.  This makes for a high degree of speculation so is quite naturally prone to boom bust price cycles.  Once the speculation seems to have overdone itself, people sell off.  Both price increases and decreases are self reinforcing, positive feedback for control systems engineers.  \n\nThe economics of mining as I stated them here amplify the positive feedback and exacerbate the boom bust.    \n\nThis all ameliorates with lowered inflation as the mining rewards decrease and a utility demand floor takes hold, where people use it as a means of exchange in the short term and price doesn't matter.  \n\nAll of this stated in the context that Bitcoin could go to zero price ten minutes from now.  \ud83d\ude09\n\n",

People work for most of their lives are not going to be excited about changing their currency and figuring out the best bitcoin wallet to use when they can just buy things the same way they always have.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are huge companies with tons of money, check out their stock price history. They have made investors money for years and years. Even if there is a benefit to paying with bitcoin it faces the huge barrier of people actually adopting it, and then these gigantic companies not offering lower fees and competing to keep business going as usual.\n\nThe widespread use and bitcoin going much higher in price is not going to be nearly as easy as you think.\n\nYou have to realize you're talking about changing a currency here, that's a crazy thing to change. Traditional currency has so much behind it with banks and infrastructure. \n\nPeople taking their hard earned money (which a lot of people don't even have much to any disposable income as it is) and changing currency that is not backed by any bank or government, just to buy things when they can just buy it like they always have, is just insanity to me. \n\nYoung people with a lot of disposable income may give it a try but that's few and far between.",

Nobody worries about easily transporting money and having it confiscated, most average citizens have little need to move money much.  When they do it's large purchases like houses, which the money is easily moved with no fear of loss.\n\nGoing back to the example, a typical credit card user who pays in full each month BENEFITS from the middle man.  The middle man gives him a cut of the profit in the form of cash back, gives him spending protections, gives him other incentives, and for the average Joe makes spending easy.  There's no incentive for him to cut out this middle man and retailers that try to see sales suffer.\n\nAnonymity of Bitcoin is highly overrated - \"with caution\" is an understatement.  To the point that it's largely a criminal reason anyone would put in that much effort.\n\nThe real benefit is possibly for retailers by shifting the costs from sellers to buyers for transactions, eliminating charge back, etc.   Buyers however have no reason to switch.   Buyers in fact have already moved away from that system (paper fiat) which had many of these features to one that doesn't (credit cards) because those features were not compelling to buyers.\n\nAnd the buyers make the rules in a competitive market.",

It is a speculative investment, the price could fall and be worth next to nothing. \n\nSo I come for a laugh, offer resistance to the idea that bitcoin is the second coming of jesus, and hope to put doubt in the mind of someone who was going to put a lot of their money into bitcoin.",

A credit card transaction involves an enormous amount of middle men, and what may seem simple to you is way overly complicated. It also involves multiple points of failure, and protecting us from these risks costs a lot of money. Bitcoin however, is self-maintained and removes all the complications and costs of accounting, security, verification, etc. When something is more efficient, it usually gets implemented once it's tweaked to an acceptable level of production. The thing is 10 years is not long enough to see mainstream adoption, but it is long enough to establish a strong foundation that has proven to be worth building on. Now is when the real innovation begins. We're going to see a lot of layers, protocols, side chains, etc developed to improve the bitcoin network, and it's already happening as we speak. \n\nWhen in the history of technology have we ever said, \"OK the systems we have in place already work fine, let's stop improving them now.\"? Never! Yes credit cards and current systems work, but bitcoin can definitely work better on multiple fronts of accounting, cross border translations, and overall efficiencies in way too many ways to mention. User friendly interfaces and things like wallet address translations,etc. will be built and if the past decade is any indication, this thing is not slowing down.",

It is a speculative investment, the price could fall and be worth next to nothing.  \n\nI see. Well, that's quite a noble reason :)  \n\nSpeaking for myself, I don't think bitcoin's price will increase \"astronomically\". But I am somewhat confident that the price in, say, ten years, will be higher than it is today. And I am also fully accepting and prepared for the price to be lower during those ten years or even forever. Nothing is impossible.     \n\nBut it is not only the price: it's also voicing of disagreement with (parts of) the banking system in general and with (parts of) the financial practices of my country, as well as monetary system as a whole. Obviously I am aware that my voice doesn't count much, but I am doing something that I find right and good, and that's all I can do as an individual: withdrawing my participation (at least as far as I can) from a system I find flawed, and transferring my time and money into a system that I find better. \n\n \nTo your second group:  \n\n> 2) The belief that the whole financial system is going to fall apart and people all around the world will choose bitcoin as their currency, then it will become the world's currency. Basically, a doomsday prepper.  \n\nI am actually hugely optimistic for the world in general. I think bitcoin will empower people in general, and it doesn't have to overthrow the banking system completely (I don't believe it will, at least probably not in my lifetime). It is enough if bitcoin offers a viable alternative as an exit from the politicized financial system, abuse of authority, and abuse of money printing press. Better to have an exit option (even if not perfect) from that system, than no option at all.  \n\nImo bitcoin will do well even without a catastrophical system failure and I am definitely not wringing my hands in joyful expectation of any kind of economical crashes.  \n\nFurthermore, it's also interesting from a research/technical point of view, and having \"skin in the game\" motivates me to learn more about it and improving my understanding, as well as OpSec (operational security) skills, such as taking care of my keys, my back ups etc.  \n",

To hold or to spend requires no third party, merely a functional network.  The network functions very well up to this point.  \n\nUltimately, who would prefer to require permission to spend one's own money, so we differ on which is \"real money.\"  So you may not want to hold it, but you may have a requirement that you want to be unencumbered by banks.  There is real and growing use for this.  Every week some $10s of millions are transferred into Venezuela, evading bank sanctions imposed by the international banks and by the Venezuelan banks.  That's real use demand not speculation.  \n\nI think that the speculative value sees the possibility of more and more use of the currency units.  The array of possibilities compared to banks is as potent as the Internet as compared to traditional media.  Not merely political posture.

Bitcoin doesn't represent anything except pure scarcity, so far as I can figure.  Maybe that's what I don't understand.\n\nDoes this analogy express it well?\n\nIt's as though scientists have discovered a new substance.  It's expensive to produce, but hard to detect.  It has no inherent use.  Now, while smugglers might start using Bitcoinium as a medium of exchange, there's nothing about Bitcoinium that makes it worth anything.  It's not connected to any human work beyond the work required to produce it.  So the value of Bitcoinium should tend to hover slightly above the cost of that work, with an added value coming from smuggler demand.\n\nSo if I were going to try to price Bitcoin, shouldn't I pretty much just aim to guess how much that added value is going to be, plus the future cost of mining?  But no one seems to act that way, which is confusing.",

            "Text": "No. Not really at all.  \n\nBoth of your notions are better expressed by the notion of \"permissionless.\" Bank money requires strong identity, contracts and a system of forceful jurisprudence.  We don't think about those things but bank money can't work without that.  Bitcoin takes care of all that in a network protocol.  \n\nBitcoin requires no identity, no legal contract and no court enforcement, yet it has never been fraudulent and has a perfect (error free to 15 decimals) transaction record.  So a twelve year old in England can send a ten year old in Zimbabwe money and no one else can prevent it or really even know what really happened.\n\nIndeed, the protocol itself can be modified and new networks can be made.  There are thousands of innovations just like that; most are failed experiments.  \n\nSo illicit is not a broad enough concept and it is a bit derogatory.  Some of the applications are indeed illicit, but that's just a subset of the freedom of permissionless.  \n\nPosturing or signalling is also an inadequate description.  The printing press, the PC, the Internet were highly \"subversive,\" not as gesture but as real movement of the locus of control from some distant authority to the individual.  Same for Bitcoin but even more powerful than the other examples.  \n\nWhat the Internet is doing to traditional media, Bitcoin will do to the banks.  Without banks, government is also radically altered.  \n\nThink of the deep sociological impact of a world where commerce happens without third party consent and little third party knowledge.  Most people are frightened by that, but like it or not, it's arriving.  This is a much deeper impact than even the Internet.  \n\nThis is hardly mere signalling and really a complete reorienting of power.  But sure, signalling happens too.  \n\nIn day to day utility already the uses are substantially broader and deeper.  Free speech platforms, microtransactions, remittance, speculative investment, programmable contracts, automated predictions markets, uncensorable apps.  All valuable, none illict.  \n\n",

Though niche there are already few use cases it is better than its\u2019 alternatives like sending money overseas, buying stuff online with a discount etc.\n\nFinally there is a beauty in its\u2019 design. Proof of Work, immutable transaction chain that is decentralized is something we were not used to and even as a small variation worth keeping.\n\nNote that I only keep a very small percentage of my savings as Bitcoin so I do not advocate it as a safe or sound investment.

Even if we have some unusual situation like the market just kind of makes a hover bottom and begins trending higher you would see it on the moving averages and right now they are all pointing down\n\nIf you really want to educate yourself on price action. There's one guy on YouTube that's worth following and gives daily explanations of what's going on and you can kind of take it in. Krowns crypto cave.

You didn't 'want' the current version of your credit card. It showed up in the mail, as a replacement for your previous card. Technology has a way of creeping into our society. Younger tech savvy generations love the concept of crypto. Bitcoin is a push - NOT pull system. Someone has your credit card they can pull from it without you initiating the transaction. It aligns with pretty much everything else in society in terms of digital, routable content. Our music, our work, our communication, has all turned into digital routable content. The next logical step is money. \nNot to mention, Bitcoin is global and not tied to any one country or region. It's cheap to send, regardless of the amount you're sending. Currently we have many different currencies in the world, but Bitcoin is a global generic for ALL. If you want to convert from one currency to another, there is no middle step you can choose to hold the value in. Sure we have gold, but try liquidating gold in a simple click online. The potential of bitcoin is not even completely discovered, and already it looks incredible. ",

Your convenience with a credit card came from credit card providers developing services to compete with each other for you to be their customer, but the initial technology wasn't for the average Joe.",

I haven't paid attention to them in awhile to be honest. \n\nI find illicit to connotate illegal or morally rejected.  Alot of financial transactions are not permitted due to other reasons than those.  \n\nPermitted, Legal and moral are not much the same.  I will go with boggleroggle.  Permissionless isn't a great term either as it still makes reference to permission.  Bitcoin has no frame of reference at all that even considers permission.  Anyway...\n\nAlso... mining cost follows price through a  process known as difficulty adjustment. The mining rewards are in Bitcoin so the value of the rewards is a direct function of current Bitcoin price.  Since it is a permissionless competition to solve the mining puzzle, mining tends to be marginal.  The network is designed to keep a fairly constant block production rate.  So as hashrate increases or decreases, the difficulty to solve the puzzle automatically adjusts with it to keep the block production rate fairly constant.  The net of all that is that the cost to produce fairly well mimics the price of the coin with difference due to price changes and the local circumstances of the miner in question.  \n\nSo the value is the demand value and mining costs follow. They are not fundamental like say gold, if that makes sense.",

G+ tried to add few pretty features and move the masses. Bitcoin also created a new paradigm, a decentralized exchange with a network of dedicated users. Comparing BitcoinCash to g+ is more accurate.\n\nWhat people miss is that Bitcoin is still young. 10 years might sound a lot to you, but in this domain where current banking system is established for almost half a millennia it is pretty young. Only 50million users out of potentially billions that might (a big if) be using it. Technically 20 years down the road anybody with an IoT device can use Bitcoin as a side wallet if there are enough incentives (again another big if).\n\nNow I already underlined this is a high risk investment, thus should be allocated a small part of your portfolio.
