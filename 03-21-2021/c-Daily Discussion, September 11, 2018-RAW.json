I think if we get back above 6300 then we could see the squeeze. If i was in a short sellers position right now I would be happy to lock in gains down at this level from the recent highs of 7400 in such a short amount of time, wait for a move higher to get back in.",

When I try to take my money into my own wallet outside of coinbase?\n\nYep, the bitcoin transaction fee applies when you shift bitcoin from 1 wallet to another. This depends on the current demand on the network and how quickly you want the transaction to be confirmed (though many exchanges make you pay a higher rate without giving you an option to lower it).\n\nThe fee doesn't depend on the amount of bitcoin. Buying in chunks in Coinbase won't affect the transaction fee when you want to withdraw, since bitcoin isn't actually moved when you make a purchase on an exchange. Your main concern would be coinbase's initial buying fee, if you are paying a % fee with each purchase there would be no difference there either.\n\nDue to the demand these days, transactions with no fees don't usually make it into a block.\n\nedit: just to be clear, the bitcoin transaction fee is different to the fees you pay Coinbase when buying BTC.

            "Text": "Exactly. It is staggering how people prefer to trade bitcoin short-term for some dollars of profit (actually even that often turns up a loss) when they could do easily HODL and make a magnitude higher amount in a few years. \n\nI will excuse the guys who lost out in this way in 2012 and 2015 bear markets because bitcoin was truly in untested waters and a lot more uncertain about the whole experiment. But now after knowing that this is tried and trusted technology and immensely difficult to shut down, future suckers who lose out due to myopic view will have no excuses. They will look back with salty eyes wondering in their middle or old age.. \"what on earth was I thinking when I sold my bitcoin for those few dollars\"? They will come back to these reddit posts and further punch themselves for ignoring what would seem even to them obvious on hindsight in their middle / old age. You are warned and you have been warned!",

I'm not sure who's working on atomic multipath payments or what the timeframe may be, but that should substantially increase the size of transactions that can be routed.  Also, I imagine LN will grow a lot the next time we see a substantial increase in TX fees.  \n  \nIt's not the easiest to setup a node, but if I can do it, I'm fairly confident you can too.  This should also get more streamlined over time.  \n  \nUI development should help some, and on that note: there's [this from LND](https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2018/09/10/lightning-app.html).",

Some whales buying back, and then everyone else selling it back down for crumbs of profit. \n\nWhen they are ready, there will be another FOMO cycle, and prices will go nuts again.

Coinbase charges their own 1.5% fee for all purchases like mine, big or small.\n\nThey deliver bitcoin to my coinbase account about 5 days after the purchase starts, but the price locks in at the time the purchase is initiated.\n\nYou only pay bitcoin transaction fees when you send coins from coinbase to your own wallet or another exchange. This is usually somewhere between $0.05 and $0.50 total . Transaction fees aren't much to worry about unless you're doing dozens or hundreds of transactions a day.",

So whatever you mean by 'intrinsic value ' or lack of it is actually good for bitcoins use case of money. \n\nWe don't have to hope for miners. The incentives in bitcoin through fees and block rewards automatically incentivise miners without needing any hope. \n\nYou talk of thieves and that can happen with cash and gold too. At least in bitcoin, you have the flexibility of keeping things very inconspicuous and controlling multiple keys which no one can know about. So easier to have plausible deniability. \n\nNo sign of govts in most parts of the world trying to actively obstruct but even if they do, they will find it difficult to control the peer to peer nature of the coin. Yes they will tax it but I am not saying you should look at bitcoin as a tax evasion technique. Pay your taxes. ",
