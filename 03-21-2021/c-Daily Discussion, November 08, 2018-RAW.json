I guess because it would be too similar to what Bitcoin Cash is?\n\nHow are they going to explain Charlie Lee? Is he also part of block stream? What about all of the Vertcoin developers? Are they ALL in cahoots as well? What about all of the students at MIT working on the LIT Lightning Network, are they all colluding with blockstream too? Seriously its so strange.",

Pumps due to incessant media articles and pressure to buy because others are buying are what result in unsustainable surges and later disappointment such as what you seem to have. But for the surge in nov and Dec, the bitcoin price trajectory appears a pretty reasonable extension of rest of 2017. I remember huge hype only in November and December. Rest of the year was tame in hype compared to these. Infact no hype occurred at all until mid May then again slipping until July and gradually building in Aug through Oct. Nov and Dec were indeed insane hype of the kind that does more harm than good as you are seeing.",

His or Her models have always predicted a much deeper crash, and then they readjust their model, and then claim they have been right the whole time. Their analysis is as much trash as someone claiming it's going to moonshot everyday. \n\nAnyone who has been around crypto knows that this is how the price has always behaved.

I, like many people have been saying that bitcoin is here to stay, and I've always said it could take years to change things related to how we do our finances. I've also bought when it was low and when it was high. After years in this space I've learned that anyone who constantly posts predictions, for bear or for bull, have some agenda...often to feel some sort of lacking sense if validation. Otherwise, why else constantly post in a preaching way, as though there's something you believe you know that the rest of us don't? \n\nI can assure you that there are no rules when it comes to bitcoin. No TA that has been accurate outside of pure luck and no way to predict fallouts like when we faced Mt Gox or spikes like the past 3 bullruns. You can say it will be years before the next ATH all you want, but I know from past experience that any given day a development could unfold that could send the price skyrocketing and you can be sure that the snowball effect of FOMO will kick in and interest will follow price... despite what you say. Just as easily, another development could tank it just as quick. Being realistic is easy, you just need to be aware of how much you don't know. Try it sometime.",
