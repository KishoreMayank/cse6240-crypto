Bitcoin is going mainstream, there's going to be a higher demand for the coin, and because of the limited amount it can only rise in value. Just wait, you'll get your return.\nMy friend bought in the day before the crash early this year, at 120$ per coin, it dropped to 60$ per coin, and within a few months he was up to 250$ per coin and sold them on to me. I luckily bought the day before the massive price surge, and they quadrupled in a week.\n\n\u2014-\n\n\n\u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"\n\n-George Santayana",

The price was high because people seen an opportunity to make huge profits on their investments so everyone wanted in and that drove the price up and the earlier you got in the higher your profit.\n\nThe price is low because people wanted to cut their losses, and others don't want anything to do with bitcoin because they feel it is a scam. And all this TA and charts are just for show nobody know shit about this they can say they do but even a broke clock is right 8.33&#37; of the time.

            "Text": "I bought a $13,000 Hybrid car with only 26k miles.  Whenever I find myself spending too much time on this thread  or thinking about investing in Bitcoin, I go out and drive for Lyft.  I earn between $800 and $1300 per week with weekly bonuses and will earn around $40k in profit this year.  After writing off $0.535 per mile, I will have a very small tax bill on that profit.  I work Lyft around my regular work hours (I own and operated an online business as well as a wholesale business).  So by not wasting too much time on this thread, I am turning a $13k investment into $120K over the next three years.  Plus the stress of owning Bitcoin is not taking a toll on my health.  Just some food for thought.",

            "Text": "That means you'll either cash out before the true bitcoin ATH since you don't actually believe in adoption. Or you might sell at a loss because again you don't believe in adoption.  Bitcoin is financial freedom disguised as a get rich quick scheme; you need to look at the big picture and realize it really has the potential the change the world. \n\nWe have the ability to send money instantly (lightning network) and semi-anonymously without ANYONE being able to stop us. Also, this money is programmable and we can store it in literally ANY medium, even with just our minds! Do you think society is collectively going to say nah and pass up on something like this? Do you really think this might be just a fad? ",

Can never be held back from you during a run on a bank or shutting down of atm machines in a crisis. Billions of dollars can be stored securely in a tiny chip that can rest on a keychain and carried around (unlike gold bars).  Smaller amounts on a bar code on your phone.  Can provide you the freedom to be your own bank in complete control of your own money.  And more...  \n\nThe price going up and you getting a lambo should be a pleasant byproduct of early adoption.

That, of course, is different from selling an asset now in the expectation that you can buy MORE of it later at a lower price, and thus have more of the asset and greater profits if it rebounds.",

It's not perfect but it's legitimate and the customer instruments have improved by leaps.  Almost all merchants accept credit/debit cards (and of course cash) and e-payment is also now widely accepted where payment can be made with a simple to use NFC.  National level cross-bank systems now allow transfers between banks that are instant and $0 fee.  Across countries, SWIFT has served us well for decades.\n\nIf you want anonymous, just use cash.  And why would I care about staying anonymous when my purchases are legit and I have nothing to hide?\n\nI'm sorry but this whole narrative about cryptos being superior to the current banking system is just a fringe movement that the public is not interested in.",

Lastly, bitcoin doesn't need to replace current currencies for years. In this infant stage, Bitcoin simply need to offer a co-existing system that socially unites currency use on a global level.Think about it. The more that individual countries create be their own independent blockchain token in your scenario, the more value there is in a globally accepted currency that also functions as a store of value. The possibilities are endless and it's playing out like a book. If you can't envision just how embedded in our future this is going to be, you need to look harder.",

The only thing getting *exchanged* with Bitcoin futures are dollars, not the good or service itself.\n\nIf an asset (i.e. Bitcoin) is never exchanged (i.e. delivered), it's not a market. It's just gambling. That's fine if that's what it is. But, let's call a spade a spade. Giving something an official sounding name is just misleading. \n\nI would really like to see a court differentiate between futures and gambling. If an asset/good/service actually gets exchanged, then you have a market. Without an actual exchange of an asset/good/service, I really don't see how its any different than gambling.",
