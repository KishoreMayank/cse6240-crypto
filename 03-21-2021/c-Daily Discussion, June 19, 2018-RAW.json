The chain is only as strong as it\u2019s weakest link.\n\nAlso the bank have insured their fund, so after a robery, they get their fund back. And if a bank go bust the saving account are insured up to a certain amount so if you\u2019re playing safely you should not be out of your money.\n\nIf an exchange go bust, most probably the customer will get nothing. \n\nHowever it seems that exchanges have a higher security than before and most of the fund are on cold wallet, so only a portion of the BTC are really on a hot wallet for daily transaction. If they have the funds to cover the loss of the hot wallet, they could potentially be able to reimburse their customers from their own pocket (through the fee they got previously and continuously). Or maybe they\u2019ll be insured. Once customer knows their fund is safe and insured, working on an exchange will be safer than secur NG your own private key.\n\nSecuring your own private key equate a the moment to bury deep your stash of money and storing the treasure map either mentally or securing the treasure map. You could fail to secure your treasure map and never be able to access your fund anymore (forget the seed, loose the private key) or having the treasure map stolen from someone close or having your house burn down, ... their is so much more possibility to loose your coins then to loose your fiat.\n\nUnless you are living in a country with hyper-inflation, then you have a bigger problem at hand because you have more chance to be knifed for your grocery bag than thinking about crypto.\n\nWe are still at a really early stage for the masses, but I\u2019m sure thing will get into an equilibrium. But the equilibrium might be either at a price that you won\u2019t like or end up being ungodly rich. Nobody knows the future and anybody pretending *insert ticker* will reach * insert absurd number * by * insert any date * is a biased person that would profit of such prediction and hoping his prediction will be right because he\u2019ll cash out for fiat at that point and forget about crypto.",

It doesn't matter what a government does to keep the economy in a stable position. Zero Hedge writers will always fire the same gun. Hyperinflation and currency collapse. \n\nThese writers don't care about long term strategies. They would gladly see the world burn to ashes if that helped to prove their point.\n\n> If you lend to the banks and the banks buys the government bonds...\n\nThe banks don't always buy the government bonds.
