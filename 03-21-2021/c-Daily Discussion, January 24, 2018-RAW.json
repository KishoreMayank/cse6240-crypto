Clearly the suspect in question was involved with some shady stuff and if he\u2019s helped facilitate movement of stolen coins that\u2019s one thing to punish.  My observations are around the penalties just for allowing private transactions. //// \n\n\nThey\u2019ve effectively criminalized privacy.  What they did to bank secrecy around the globe is just nuts. That every bank on the planet asks customers if they\u2019re a \u201cUS person\u201d\nSimilarly they can go and strong-arm every exchange on the planet  for full AML/KYC info.  \n\nLook how they attack \u201cmixers\u201d in this doc. \n\nSure they won\u2019t be able to freeze your account anymore but they\u2019ll know how much you own and just say pay up mofo or you\u2019ll get 30 yrs for that $3k you owe us. \n\nAs a US citizen you already have to disclose financial accounts you own outside the states.  Brokerages already feed every single trade to the government.  Soon for crypto unless something is done to protect users. \n\nIt seems the only privacy that will ever come is with broader roll-out out of crypto as final forms of payment, right ? \n\nWhat is it any of their business what you do with your money?   What is it their business to arbitrarily decide that savings accounts can only have six withdrawals per month ?\n\nI am very new to BTC topic but am cheering on for the People to take financial privacy back.   This whole premise \u201cwe gotta watch you so we make sure you\u2019re not a  criminal and if you do ANYTHING to impede our watching of you that\u2019s a crime in itself\u201d is absolutely nuts.  How did this the greater populace submit so easily to this?  I mean people are installing cameras inside their homes and they would object if govt and vendors were open about the back doors provided.  And yet surveillance of your finances is accepted by the populace.  ",

So we should not expect As and Bs... If we expect this and get disappointed and sell, what happens? If Berkshire Hathaway gets a B (thats Warren Buffet's company) can we reasonably expect cryptos to perform as well or higher? No - let's be realistic.\n\nIf your favorite coin(s) is not given a shiny top rating, DO NOT sell it knee-jerk with your pants on fire.\n\nI can't overstate this enough: we all need to settle down at the moment. This market has been made fragile by all of our own reactive behaviour - we have a chance today to try to take whatever news comes in a calm way and NOT shoot ourselves in the foot.\n\nsorry for posting this in more than one place - i think it's important",

I understand the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork, what I don't understand is how a consensus is reached to accept the fork. \n\nFor example: Lets say I add a new security feature to bitcoin and want to add it to the protocol. I would assume that most nodes are not owned by C++ developers. How do these nodes that have no idea what i'm trying to add to the protocol say, \"Yep, we need to add that\" and then convince the majority of nodes to accept it to create the fork? \n\nIs this a common thing with people constantly trying to add \"features\" to bitcoin and they are rejected? I'm just super confused how a consensus can be reached when the majority of nodes aren't going to read the proposed code to create the fork (Because they aren't fluent in C++ or just don't care)",

I was able to provide everything else they asked about (or well, I prepared documentation of the rest rather hadn't submitted it yet).\n\n1. They want a confirmation that it's me who been in the control of the cryptocurrency account/wallet. I created a specific signed message of all the addresses I ever used in the said wallet, but I'm worrying this might be too complex. Then again they seemed to have a set procedure for how to handle cryptocurrency trades. A proof of ownership of the Coinbase/GDAX account would be nice and I asked the support for this but they're not exactly blazingly fast.\n2. They also want information/proof on when the cryptocurrency account/wallet was created. Also asked the Coinbase support about this on the end due to how unclear the bank was if it was just not about my personal wallet.\n\nReally not sure if it's just the personal wallet I been in control of they're talking about (I use Electrum now but some of the old private keys I used was first created on Multibit) or the one on Coinbase/GDAX (or the ones on the various exchanges I bought on in the past). And yeah I sold BTC on GDAX.",

This is what make it valuable and, imho, still the no.1 in crypto now and for the foreseeable future:\n\n\n1. Security. It's blockchain is by far the most secure - not only by design and hashrate, but this has been proven over nine years of attempted hacks, attacks, takeovers etc. It's Proof of Work method is well tested. Other cryptos are not trying to compete on security (they can't), so go after \"fast and cheap\" transactions instead.\n\n2. Decentralization. This is one of the founding and most important tenets of bitcoin, and that which allowed it to even succeed in the first place. Bitcoin is consensus lead and has no central authority, whereas many other of these \"fast cheap\" cryptos rely on control by central nodes, companies etc. IF a cryptocurrency isn't decentralised, is there really much point in it?\n\n3.  Development. Bitcoin is aiming to develop solutions to scalability, transaction time, price etc. **without** compromising the two points above. This is a highly complex and involved task! But it is proving possible, and with Segwit, LN and other developments down the road, Bitcoin is proving to be the most technologically advanced crypto out there. (Which makes sense, it has an army of developers behind it)",

Always looking for positive signs out of Asia because could drive market bounce \u2014 Thinking out loud, my view of what happened was:\n1) whale profit taking at $20k - liquidity went parabolic so why not - whenever there are concentrated holders who are suddenly billionaires I figure some profit taking \n2) retail investors had chased the move higher, borrowed money long at 18k is \u201cweak hands\u201d \n3) futures market gave hedge funds a reason to push the short trade and CNBC got on the train as they tend to w institutional flow \n4) there is something fishy in South Korea. My guess is that there was some engineering of a dip\n5) that took the knees out and BitConnect imploding definitely heightens risk of SEC action. Find it somewhat shocking Clayton was focused on Long Blockchain and the law firms and not BitConnect/ dicey ICOs\n6) market has traded like crap despite lightning and Davos. Whales have to know lightning is key and they\u2019re not buying the dip. smart people like Hoskinson spreading some regulatory FUD so it\u2019s hard to get leveraged long without a clear catalyst\n7) usdcny going down fast, and oil higher so the two big capital flight markets (China and Middle East) probably not in a hurry to put it all in bitcoin \nThinking what could drive animal spirits again, big NEO outperformance, Baidu blockchain, alibaba rumors all feel like the market could get surprised by Chinese government coming out and saying something pro cryptocurrency. Or Korea regulatory concerns getting firmly dismissed \n\nJust exploring the idea looking for some positivity to add ",

            "Text": "Consensus is a social phenomenon. To get people to run your new rules you need to convince them somehow. You could try posting on reddit, talking to people at meetups, writing opinion pieces or any other method.\n\nLook up the UASF movement which was literally a social movement which tried to get people to use different node software, it worked and that's how segwit was added to bitcoin. Other examples of proposed changes were BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited which all failed.\n\nThe other commenters are talking about nodes, which is slightly wrong. The important thing is whether those nodes are used for economic activity, a node that runs on rented hardware and doesn't have an attached wallet does not affect the rules of bitcoin. It's an important point that bitcoin is given value by people who are willing to accept it in trade for real goods and services, they are called \"merchants\", \"economic actors\" or \"[the economic majority](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Economic_majority)\" and they express their view using full node wallets which are just tools.\n\nHave a look at this explanation of full nodes and bitcoin's security model: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lnd/\n\nNote that miners are mostly irrelevant to bitcoin's rules. Miners set the history of valid transactions, the economic majority sets the validity rules of what makes a transaction valid.",

The only alt that really survived was LTC (this was before ETH). Peercoin was a really significant contender and  Primecoin was interesting too - but they (and many others) faded into obscurity. I expect the same to happen with most of today's alts.",

It might turn out to be true, but there is literally no way to know this beforehand.\n\nThe video makes a good point, which is that BTC has weathered multiple bubbles at different stages of its overall price increase to date. Extrapolating that and saying \"BTC will always go up\" however is simply wrong \u2013 for one thing, it literally cannot go up forever.\n\nIf you're going to put money into cryptocurrencies, do it for better reasons than \"well in the past it went up.\"",

Generally all code is open source so everybody can read it themselves to decide for themselves if they want to run it.\n\nConsensus is the idea that all who agree cooperative, not that everyone must agree. If some people don't agree then they split off into their own consensus which we call an altcoin.\n\nDevelopers have nothing to do with it except some of them might be more influential in convincing people. But still, if we take the example of the UASF movement, we see that the Core developers did not have consensus in favour of the UASF, yet it still happened.",

It gives you optionality to arb or hold beyond the contract date. Dumping btc also puts downward pressure on the price so if you have a large hold you retain the option to sell before the contract expiry in hope of moving market.",

At some point this thing would need to become stable with little volatility if what you are saying is true. What is that price? Nobody knows. Maybe its up, maybe it down from where it is now. There is nothing wrong with him taking his profits and moving to a much safer investment.",

This just copies the source code, the way people actually improve bitcoin is to fork the software add their own edits and create a pull request where they ask for those edits to be merged back into the main bitcoin code.\n\n1. Fork as short for hard fork which is incorrectly used to mean bitcoin airdrop. Equivalent of an altcoin with initial premine given to existing bitcoin owners.\n\n1. Fork meaning a change of the bitcoin consensus rules, as in \"soft fork\" or \"hard fork\".\n\n1. Fork meaning an chain split.\n\nIMO most of them are used incorrectly, I'd only use the word fork to mean software fork on github becaus the other usages are just confusing. But words get their meaning from use, so we can't really do much about incorrect usage.",
