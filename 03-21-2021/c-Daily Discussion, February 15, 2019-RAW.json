            "Text": "Bitcoin fees are based on the size of the transaction, we measure them in satoshi per byte. Not all transactions are the same size. A transaction of 2 btc that has many smaller inputs will be larger than a transaction of a single 2 btc input. Similarly a transaction from a segwit wallet will be smaller than a transaction from other address types.\n\nWhen more people are requesting transactions than can be put in a single block - or when miners choose to not include as many transactions as they possibly could - a fee market develops. Transactions such as yours are put in memory while people willing to pay more per byte than you effectively jump in front of the line. Sometimes this lasts a few hours, sometimes days. In the event of attacks or extremely high use it could go on for even longer.\n\nYou can yourself jump forward in the line by using a replace by fee (RBF) transaction which is a way to make that same transactions currently in the back of the line but with a higher fee, invalidating the old transaction.",

Anyone with even a small amount of brain activity understands that bitcoin is not to blame for the QuadrigaCX  blunder and mismanagement. If your family lost all its gold because you had it hidden, and then died without telling anyone else where it was, do you think people should blame the gold?\n\nOh but make no mistake, the media will try to spin this story to profit from the ignorant who believe bitcoin is the problem, when the reality is the problem here is lack of  due diligence on behalf of the company.",
