            "Text": "Mods post these daily threads so that you guys have a place to banter about daily stuff. It's unfortunate that the only discussion that occurs in these threads is related to price obsession. We have TWO sticky spots. If mods want to sticky something that's actually **informative** or educational, we're going to do that. Because if we don't, then really good content gets lost in all the noise of people obsessing about price every single day.\n\nIf a day comes along and there's no daily thread because there's something else stickied, or the bot crashes, or whatever... it's not the end of the world. It's not an excuse to throw a temper tantrum. It doesn't mean that mods are involved in a price manipulation conspiracy, or that mods are trying to suppress bad news. You guys can stop acting like spoiled kids and start acting like adults. If you're really that obsessed about price, please log off, and go for a nice walk outdoors to get some fresh air and clear your head.\n\ne: Previous (excellent) sticky that we had to take down because too many spoiled kiddos were threatening to hold their breath until they turned blue. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i60k5/a_simplified_lecture_on_how_script_works_1_hour_5/",
