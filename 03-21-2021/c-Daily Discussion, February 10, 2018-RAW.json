All you need is Python installed and you can run it locally :)\n\nI brought this here because with one line of code it can be adopted to to Bitcoin/USD.

Is that possible? \n\nI am willing to maybe let my money stay in bitcoin and then withdraw when bitcoins stock rises. But most likely will try and cash out right away. \n\nMy only other option is to get a cheque mailed to me. But that is a 15 day process and I'd rather do instant withdrawals. \n\nJust looking for any advice I can get, cheers! ",

            "Text": "Gonna copy a comment I made yesterday.\n\nTwo reasons why I think we are in a bear market:\n\n(a) We've just seen probably the biggest bubble in crypto history (that being the explosion in BTC's price over Dec) burst, and a lot of new people who got into crypto over the hype have been burned bad. Whereas before the general mood towards crypto was very positive, now people are licking their wounds and behaving more cautiously. This means, on aggregate, that investors are (i) less likely to invest when they see positive news / movements in the price, and (ii) more likely to sell when things start to dip. Everyone is on edge, and for many these small upswings in price are simply a way for them to recover some of the losses they have incurred. This is not a mood conducive to long term upwards growth (i.e. a bull market). You have to remember that so many new people have got into crypto on the basis that they might 'get rich quick'; they couldn't care less about the technology or its long term success, and are losing interest now that the hype is gone.\n\n(b) There have been a number of recent problems with certain exchanges that are shaking peoples' faith in the security of their investments. BitGrail has just turned out to be a massive scam, Binance has been having issues, and there was an exchange (can't remember the name) just the other day that was hacked. This adds to the general sense of fear (cf. optimism) that, I believe, the market is feeling.\n\nI think the key point is that many of the new investors who entered the crypto market in Dec, who were largely responsible for the massive increase in BTC's price, have been badly burned by their experiences. Without that influx of new cash the prices of many of these coins are simply unsustainable, and it is going to take time for the market to bottom out.",

Although, the learning curve is pretty intense, I think understanding TA in the long run is really helpful. Of course its pretty impossible to time the market, but understanding the potential for a run and dip is pretty valuable. So, just curious as to why you would hold for a dip right now.\n\nThank,\nScott",

            "Text": "Two reasons why I think we are in a bear market:\n\n(a) We've just seen probably the biggest bubble in crypto history (that being the explosion in BTC's price over Dec) burst, and a lot of new people who got into crypto over the hype have been burned bad. Whereas before the general mood towards crypto was very positive, now people are licking their wounds and behaving more cautiously. This means, on aggregate, that investors are (i) less likely to invest when they see positive news / movements in the price, and (ii) more likely to sell when things start to dip. Everyone is on edge, and for many these small upswings in price are simply a way for them to recover some of the losses they have incurred. This is not a mood conducive to long term upwards growth (i.e. a bull market). You have to remember that so many new people have got into crypto on the basis that they might 'get rich quick'; they couldn't care less about the technology or its long term success, and are losing interest now that the hype is gone.\n\n(b) There have been a number of recent problems with certain exchanges that are shaking peoples' faith in the security of their investments. BitGrail has just turned out to be a massive scam, Binance has been having issues, and there was an exchange (can't remember the name) just the other day that was hacked. This adds to the general sense of fear (cf. optimism) that, I believe, the market is feeling. \n\nI think the key point is that many of the new investors who entered the crypto market in Dec, who were largely responsible for the massive increase in BTC's price, have been badly burned by their experiences. Without that influx of new cash the prices of many of these coins are simply unsustainable, and it is going to take time for the market to bottom out.\n\nHope that is helpful.",

            "Text": "Well, not entirely. Firstly to be able to say if we're in a bear or a bull market you need a definition of what that is. In stocks bear and bull markets are usually defined as a continuous movement of price in one direction over a period of 1 or 2 months. Since Bitcoin is a much more volatile asset this definition doesn't necessarily apply, so perhaps you could say we're in a bear market if the price drops continuously for two weeks. In that case you could say we have been in a bear market.   \n   \nRegardless of the definition though it is actually possible to say whether the price is in a downtrend or an uptrend and also whether it is a short or a long trend, based on some technical analysis. It's mostly bullshit if you ask me, but because many investors actually use those indicators the price behaviour often follows certain patterns.   \n   \nSo where are we now?   \n   \nLet's start with the short term. This is a time frame traders may use to spot trading opportunities. Looking at a 1 hour chart on 31/01 the 100 MA crossed 200 MA and 50 MA has crossed 100 MA going down at around $11000 showing a pattern known as a death cross which indicates a downtrend. This was immediately picked up by traders and, in both cases, followed by a massive sell off. At the moment we are nearly at the opposite situation. The 50 MA has crossed 100 MA going up and 100 MA is about to cross 200 MA at around $8200. This pattern is known as a golden cross and strongly indicates and upward trend.   \n   \nLooking at the long term - which is what investors may use to identify a good entry or exit point. Looking at a 1 day price chart we're still clearly in an uptrend. For that to no longer be the case the price would have to go below around $6000, which is exactly where it bounced off recently. This is also indicated by the 50 MA slowly approaching 100 MA and when it crosses it may indicate a change of the long term trend. For that to be the case the price would have to stay below $11000 for a few more weeks/months.   \n   \nAs you can see the above doesn't allow you to predict where the price is going to go from now, but may help you in better understanding its behaviour.   \n   \nSo what to make out of all this? We appear to be on the crossroads. If the price manages to stay above around $8000 for the next few days it is very likely to indicate a short term uptrend, and it may well continue up to around $11000 in the following weeks which would mean it has officially recovered. I consider this a more likely scenario (may be wishful thinking though). An important indicator to look for is going to be crossing $9500 in the next few days. On the other hand if the price goes below $8000, or perhaps more specifically, below $7600, it is quite likely to fall to $6000 levels again, and in the longer term indicate we're in a full on bear market.   \n   \nDisclaimer: I'm not an expert.

            "Text": "Oh, I know how capital gains work and it\u2019s a little more than basic math. But go ahead and do what you want. I\u2019ll continue to wait it out and see what happens and in all fairness I\u2019ll credit you with the fact that I don\u2019t how much he bought or sold. That part is true- but I have not seen any big market buys the last 3 days and I\u2019ve been following closely because I have a lot at stake and am believing in the tech. What\u2019s selling now is not big buys but small buys and bigger sells that\u2019s starting to slow. We might see it go to 4-5k. Depends on how many want to short sell. You should not respond by calling people retarded but get your point across in a more intelligent way.",
