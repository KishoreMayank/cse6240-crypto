From what I have read, the expectation is that US citizens should not be accepting bitcoin from those addresses. But then those bitcoins can easily be transferred to other addresses and since mining is open and competitive, those transactions will get confirmed. So now, how will anyone who accepts bitcoin know for sure that they aren't actually receiving bitcoin that originated from those addresses?\n\nWill the authorities also stipulate that miners should exclude transactions from those addresses? And then there will need to be a rule that miners should not build on top of a block that has confirmed a transaction from those addresses. But how will all this be enforced unless a forked bitcoin is created that incorporates this blacklisting as a consensus rule?\n\nIf this seems to be the way things go, only Monero with its fungibility can plausibly survive. But I would like to hear how else events can play out that can still make Bitcoin viable despite the above conundrum. I hold both Bitcoin (57%) and Monero (22%) in my portfolio.",

They are certainly trying.  \n\nNeedless to say if this gets approved we will likely see a huge price increase. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Excerpts]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Members of VanEck, SolidX and the Cboe BZX Exchange met with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff earlier this week to present a new argument on why the bitcoin market is ready for an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>Instead, the proponents\u2019 argument centered around the idea that the bitcoin market is mature enough to support an ETF, and at present looks similar to markets for other assets which already have such products. The presentation gave several examples of assets that already have ETFs, including crude oil, silver and gold.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>The presentation specifically tied the idea of futures markets with spot markets, noting that for money substitutes such as gold and silver, this connection between the two can be proven with empirical evidence. Further, this type of price co-integration \u201cis evidence of a well-functioning capital market.\u201d\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>On another note, they argued that the bitcoin ecosystem is \u201cless susceptible to manipulation\u201d than other commodities which already support exchange-traded products.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-etf-seekers-met-with-sec-monday-in-latest-pitch-for-approval](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-etf-seekers-met-with-sec-monday-in-latest-pitch-for-approval)",

The mindless statements often made in this sub by those who wish to make you question your stance are background noise. As always, invest what you are prepared to lose, so you are in this with the perspective that it is a risk.  If you've stayed on the sidelines, now may the best time to get in because like all investments, you should buy when most people are over-cautious and the price is at a yearly low, because that's when it's usually the best entry point.

            "Text": "The most important post ever written on this board:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nI have been studying the Google trends chart. This log chart is particularly helpful as this is the only way to see the whole picture instead of one huge spike.\n\n[https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/google\\_trends-btc.html#log](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/google_trends-btc.html#log)\n\nNow as I have often mentioned earlier, one has to be very careful interpreting the relationship between price and search trends because they feed on each other. That said, one uncanny takeaway I see is that the price at various bear market bottoms for Bitcoin has been proportional to the square of the search index prevailing at that time. Search index on the link above is defined as the search multiple from 1/1/2012.\n\nSo if you look at the boring lows of 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015 and even late 2016, you will see that price has been very closely proportional to the square of the search index during those periods. But the relationship very quickly breaks down during any period of hype or over bullishness.\n\nMy theory is that this is because at the boring lows, Google trends are indeed a good indicator of how many people are genuinely interested in learning about bitcoin whereas during hype periods, the search index gets contaminated by speculators who are searching bitcoin only because they hear of rising price.\n\nSo now that we are at a boring low, I see a search index of roughly 25 whereas in Oct 2016, it was around 9. So this shows a support for a price of around 700 times (25/9)2 = 5400.\n\nOfcourse this is assuming that search interest has stabilised and not still contaminated by speculators but I think that's a fair assumption especially after the very dull and low volume markets in October.",

Btw, it\u2019s hard to find anything comparable to a purposely scarce technology but than again, if it was used, it would not be forked so often to fit so many needs which inflates the supply when miners are willing to mine a coin being used. \n\nSpeculators which what a HODLer is, would destroy the technology. A technology not used gets pushed aside for technology that makes life easier. The user doesn\u2019t care about how decentralized or controlled such as long as they get cheapest fees fastest. \nUsers are not idealogs. They go where the trust and cheapest service is no matter how centralized. \n\nLook at google. Every search is saved to that IP so advertisers can pay google and use target marketing. \nI want Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning, CT but if we have to wait another decade of talking about it and not using it, than where does the technology go?\n\nMy question is, should this be used as a store of value since HODLers are the main users? HODLing allows extreme volatility since each HODLer has different exit prices cause they aren\u2019t using it. That opens to door to buying windows each year or every few years so there\u2019s no rush to get in now when someone can buy at the same price in a year IF the technology is adopted. ",

I have also become a tougher and less fearful person, because I have survived these steep dips.  I spend time having fun on bitcoin related social media and discussion forums spreading my knowledge & excitement about this amazing technology. It distracts me from my otherwise mundane life and I am much less stressed. Sometimes I take breaks to read, and wonder how I could ever go back to my prior nocoiner condition.  Shame on the panic sellers who never really believed in the coin, since I believe this is like horses betting for most of them. \n\n\ud83d\ude09",

The profit were massive in december-January and prompted the miner to hoard a shitload of mining equipment. It just took time for all that equipment to get on the network nullifying all profit to be made.\n\nScaling down take also time because there is a bit of chicken game before one realize they cannot keep running at a loss. It goes faster for people running it as a business and have large utility to pay. Some hobby miner are delusional and are mining at a loss hoping for the price to come back up. Some people have access to free electricity (hobby miner with electricity included in the rent and other people stealing electricity at work/school/dorm)\n\nMining is like trading, everyone is a genius during a bull run. Except that it\u2019s harder to liquidate when you are a miner that didn\u2019t broke even on his investment.",

            "Text": "Absolutely. If it can be successful as a store of value, then it will then be proven as able to function as a currency. Using your own example, an iPhone or OS can be integrated into mainstream use within several years these days, because it is merely a 'next step' to existing tech already used and the foundation has been laid.\n\nNow if talking about currency, this is something that takes generations and generations to implement. Currency is embedded into the very fabric of our existence. As a child, what is the most recommended strategy for learning to count - currency! How many generation do you think it would take to shift the mindset to learning to count in Satoshi? To completely restructure, and reprogram the way existing purchases are made will take many many years. However, if bitcoin becomes utilized as a secure and mass adopted store of value, the use as a currency could be expedited by years. If you already have it, you're eventually more likely to spend it. But for now, in these EXCEPTIONALLY early days, the price could rapidly and dramatically change in one day due to the high volatility. So right now, at this point in time, whether you like it or not, Bitcoin is a high risk investment. That's a great start and I'll take it. Because one day many years from now, once the masses have stored wealth in Bitcoin, the price will settle after saturation of value-store adoption, and the volatility will level off. Then, and only then will most people be willing to spend this currency without having to worry that the Bitcoin they just used to buy that new TV now would be worth double had they kept it in their wallet. Nobody can blame a person for not wanting to spend it just yet.\n\nSo yeah, store of value works for me. I think it blows gold away as a store of value, and that more and more people will feel that way going forward. I might be right, I might be wrong, but that's my take on it.",

Sure the potential of the tech is fantastic, but for now it's speculative, simple as that. Place your bet on the future and have fun.

People are trading baseball cards it feels like. Currency is harder to relate to than all technology. As Andreas Antonopolous said, bitcoin is only the 5th innovation with currency after credit cards 50 years ago. \nIf I was a developer in this field, I would be so frustrated that people would rather sit on something I worked years on and not be used for the purpose it was designed. You say the technology is \u201cearly\u201d.  10 years is a long time but That\u2019s true when taken as a currency but there is already plenty of stores of value! We need this to be used and adopted so the future generations will have superior store if value if that\u2019s how they want to use it cause these forks are causing significant inflation when no one knows when it\u2019ll be stabilized. \n\nEarly adopters; take Satoshi Nakamoto for example, have significantly less risk cause they get 1:1 ratio on all forks so they have the luxury to sit back and see how the world changes. These buying windows will eventually force speculators/HODLers to realize the fact they don\u2019t need a store of value if they can buy back at the same price in a year or two. Adoption is the key.

Would they blacklist every single wallet used in the tumbling process all the way down to minsecule denominations? And what if somehow my wallet has some of these tainted coins dropped in, is my wallet address now suddenly blacklisted? Because there is no way to prevent somebody from sending you coins once they find your receiving address and send it.",

Many of us are prepared to lose on this \"small portion of our total investment money\" risk. Many of us know what we got into, and if there's not this huge risk involved perhaps would have used that risk money elsewhere, but still in just as equally of a risk manner. You should not assume that everyone invested in bitcoin deserves to be spoken down to as though you are above them. Nobody will ever listen to that, nor should they.",

Other coins that already existed at the new address will not be considered tainted. This sort of taint designation is possible because inputs to an address are all clearly segregated. \n\nThis does still mean problems for the receiving address because they will not immediately know which of the coins at their address are tainted without employing some analysis. Further most wallets do not easily allow choosing selected inputs when sending a btc amount. So it will be trouble for the receiving address to identify tainted coins and to prevent them from being sent out in their next transaction.",

What's preventing the people from doing what they're doing now and just using Bitcoin naturaly The government can't intervene and block a transaction from happening so people will still freely use their Bitcoin regardless if they hold \"tainted coins\" that the government says you can't use anyways. I mean if someone came up to me and told me I can't use my Bitcoin with their service someone else would end up taking it, not to mention other countries who says they will care about these \"tainted coins\" I see what you're saying but the government would need to have control of the entire network and have every single wallet address linked to an identity and would need every other country to participate for this to work.",

            "Text": "Well, as someone who actually structured and traded ETFs and derivatives on various assets, let me explain. ETF is more straight forward. The structuring bank will actually have to go and buy the underlying crypto currencies when the fund is launched. That is why ETF launch is so bullish for BTC. Further new ETF units can be created at the request of market makers following investor demand - also bullish. Existing units can be destroyed when investors sell a lot to the market-makers - then physical crypto will be dumped. Day-to-day ETF price fluctuations are managed (hedged) by market-makers mainly via more liquid futures. Maybe that is why futures were allowed to launch first. It is correct to say that actual cryptos do not change hands when the futures are cash settled. BUT, the futures do move the underlying market, because arb traders and the ETF market makers will seek to profit when price deviates too much between a future and the crypto index it is tracking. I.e. by actually buying the underlying assets or shorting it. So, due to moves in ETFs and futures the physycal BTC etc will have to be traded on the relevant crypto exchanges. The derivative markets often grow bigger than their underlyings (tail w\u0430gs the dog), but they do not 'steal' investors. These new instruments are created to give access to the underlying risk for groups of investors who were initially blocked out (by regulations, investment mandate or trading technology). So, the more players enter the crypto market at the various levels the better. It will be harder for whales to orchestrate their manipulations!",

Why would I want to take on counter party risk, political risk, inflation risk when holding a political currency?\n\nEverything, imo, is going to be repriced. Once confidence is lost in a currency, it\u2019s over. Bitcoin has more credibility in its monetary policy than any centrally controlled money. \n\nHow can we continue to run trillion dollar deficits? Especially when we\u2019re starting trade wars with our biggest creditor.  This debt is mathematically impossible to repay, so the government has 2 options.\n1. Default and talk to creditors about restructuring/cut entitlements. Seems unlikely imo given the president\u2019s agenda and unwillingness to compromise.\n2. Fed printing press. Print money, and socialize the losses via inflation. Why would someone want to hold a currency that is likely to be massively debased? Humanity is waking up. \n\nDefining the risk free asset is the most important calculation one can make, and currently most define that as federal reserve notes. It is the basis for which all financial calculations are based upon, and I think the market is wrong. Bitcoin, within 30 years, will be the risk free asset. That\u2019s my bet. ",
