            "Text": "Different view of recession. The $ always exists during a recession at the same value.  Than everyone runs to a fixed supply such as gold (before bitcoin) to protect wealth. \n\nIt\u2019s the goods such as the housing market etc... that deflate. If people knew how many dollars would be printed (inflation rate of the $), it would mitigate recession and allow people to plan. The Federal Reserve wants a recession every 10 years. There\u2019s no need for that anymore when we can pick a medium of exchange that established its inflation rate forever. \n\nInflation is a tax on people who save ( retirement for example). Every year at 3% inflation, that lonely saved is worth less and less. Inflation benefits the debtors which is always the Federal Government so they can get elected without raising taxes. \n\nTime is changing with the upcoming smartest generation of all time-  who walk around with computers in their pockets and never have to guess but know with 100% certainty any question they want an answer too within 20 seconds.
