            "Text": "Here is a gedanken experiment. Imagine bitcoin starting out but somehow being a very stable asset from the beginning of its lifetime. It steadily and gently keeps rising with only gentle dips (much like how the newbies would ideally like it to behave). Consider the consequences now. Whoever now bought such a well behaved bitcoin would hodl without fear and would have simply no incentive to sell at all or to even attempt trading. Why bother when you are gaining steadily anyhow. Result would be that such a bitcoin reaches a very high value but remains heavily concentrated in the hands of miners or whoever managed to buy. All these holders are sitting on huge wealth without worry because bitcoin is so well behaved. Now one day some large holders finally decide to cash out and sell a good chunk. This reduces market price and for the first time induces fear in some other holders who also then decide to take profits. This thinking spreads and very soon a huge quantity is dumped as it was owned by only a few holders who feared losing a good chunk of their wealth. Thus the very high priced bitcoin finally crashes hard. \n\nNow how might things have been better or the crash softer for the same high priced bitcoin? Well it would have been so if there had been a lot more holders with most sitting on modest profits that they were not that jittery about. In this way, neither would people have sold so much nor would there have been a coordinated dump by a few. \n\nBut how could such a state have arrived? Only if the route to the high price had been attained by interim cycles of fear and hope which triggered continuous exchange of Bitcoin from one set of holders who cash out a portion through fear and another set of buy at lower prices out of hope. Only through a few such fear/ hope cycles would you reach a state of high priced bitcoin that is not as susceptible to a massive coordinated dump as the one in our initial gedanken experiment. \n\nThe conclusion being: the cycles of fear and hope that we see is the only way in which a limited supply of bitcoin can disperse into a state that makes a high priced non-volatile bitcoin sustainable after a few cycles. Something to think about for those who say bitcoin can never succeed because it is such a volatile asset. I argue on the contrary it can never succeed without such volatile cycles because the coins wouldn't then disperse enough for it to become a success.",

And its like short to medium term stuff.  And its shape is updownupdown, but with each one being a smaller travel.  And after the tops of the graphs and the bottoms of the graphs intersect - then the previous motion resumes.  This would be the upwards stuff leading into late last years big up thingy.\n\nSo.\n\nIf you check on the graph of the last 12 months and start the pennant at the all time high and then take the highs and lows and draw lines on them bad guys...   you get an intersection - the end of the pennant.\n\nRight about now.\n\nAnd if this was a big old pennant, we should be at the start of a nice long upwards thingy.\n\nThe only question - and I have been waiting months for this to finish is whether we have one more up and down, over the next say 2-3 weeks, or if we have had the last up and down as the size of it is small now.\n\nJust saying this might be the start of a long long upward thingy.\n",

Take a look at this blockchain based data on bitcoin distribution.\n\n[https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)\n\nIt is not entirely foolproof due to number of addresses is not quite the same as number of owners but still reasonably as good data as we can get.\n\nTo check if bitcoins are still being dispersed, I regularly look at the % of coins in the buckets 0.001 - 0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, 0.1 to 1 and 1-10. Right now this is 0.12%, 0.72%, 3.28%, 8.82%.\n\nTake a look at what it was back in October and November last year when bitcoin was at the same price level as now. Here is a snapshot from 13th Nov 2017 when the price was more or less like today:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20171113011125/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20171113011125/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)\n\nWe see 0.1%, 0.62%, 2.81%, 8.36%. So we have reached a better susainable price than when the same price was reached last year. If you go to October of last year, the improvement is even more stark.",

Basically, once the buy pressure overwhelms the sells, and that will require volume as more people jump on the train moving forward. This is a long game and anyone talking about short term price movement are doing so purely for entertainment. When the big players drop those huge loads of Bitcoin, they don't give any signals or means to predict this move. They may even make a big purchase right before selling off 3X the purchase amount. The short game is dangerous, at least IMO, my humble one. ",

            "Text": "What was the trigger though in 2015 for the recovery from the 200/300 range? I think it was mainly because the bears ran out of steam and supply passed to hodlers.\n\nBack then the 200 to 300 range was what 6k to 8k appears to be now. And no real trigger manifested that took it out from this range. Just happened with no one really expecting it. Same with $5 to $7 range in 2012.\n\nI think the reason is simply that hodlers eventually capture the majority of a limited supply and from then on the speculative ups and downs have less and less of an effect until upward pressure prevails. That then sets of fomo and upward pressure reinforces the situation. The tide finally turns only after the rise from previous base becomes so huge that even a good chunk of the old hodler base starts selling if only due to prudent risk management concerns and a desire to book at least some profits. This is when the fall starts and this where we are now. It will continue until majority supply again passes to the next batch of hodlers.\n\nThese cycles will continue until adoption reaches so high that hodlers will no longer wait for a very huge rise before selling part of their stash and also when the coins become so widely dispersed that selling by few individuals no longer impacts price by too much. Thus the volatility will decrease.\n\nWhat I said is not my original insight but was described by Michael Casey in his 2016 article\n\nhttps://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da",
