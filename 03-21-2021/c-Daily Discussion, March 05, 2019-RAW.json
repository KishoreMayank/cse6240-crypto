[Here](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BnDw2kcCPsAZQaLEf6DfkPLU5hBCnY7Vb) is the address. It sent out many small 0.0023btc transactions over the last day or so it seems. Great right?\n\nSo I moved the coins to another wallet and oddly enough the coins showed up but there was some missing - and the exact amount missing was the amount listed in the \"Estimated BTC transacted\" section on blockchain explorer. A small amount went to an [address](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1LeYz1oT7EEoXyZd4xVDDCK1FAn2BsABSB) that looks like it has been receiving many of these tiny payments in the last while. \n\nThat address does not belong to me - and from the looks of things everybody who received and moved that small amount of mystery bitcoin also had a small amount of their bitcoin diverted to this address. \n\nCould it be that this particular wallet is a scam which collects a tiny amount of BTC on every sent transaction and sends it to this address?\n\nPlease help me figure out what happened here.

            "Text": "I don't believe in benchmarking trends from wicks, and if you look at weekly candles, that spike in 12/17 was just a wick.  The trend is actually better drawn from a few weeks before that, from around $6k.  But if you go back just a month before that, now you're drawing your line from $3k, and where does that put your \"long term trend?\"\n\nYou know what's funny? I made a good chunk of change on LONG trades last year, just playing around with a tiny bit of accumulated BTC.\n\nThis year I'm exchanging fiat for BTC again.  Just moved my big order up from $3600 to $3700 (had moved it up previously from $3000) so I'm hoping against hope that the big bears find some more borrowed BTC to dump at a loss.  \n\nYour posts are going to age horribly, and you will regret not having bought this ill-considered dip, probably for the rest of your life. I was on BitcoinTalk back in 2014-2015, and there were a lot of people there just like you.  They were wrong then, and you're wrong now.\n\n[EDIT to say...] Those people on BTCTalk were more obnoxious than you, now that I think about it.  Back then it was all, \"Bitcoin is dead! You guys are idiots for buying!\"  Nobody thinks Bitcoin will die now.",

Also read about Gartner hype cycles.  \n\n\nI do, however, agree that short-term price action is hard to predict but bubbles form in a pattern and burst similarly, too.",
