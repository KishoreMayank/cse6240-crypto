Peeps getting upwards of 20 upvotes for bashing lack of fundamentals, dissing retards for buying right now, and talk of btc going to zero. Finally, the capitulation is here!! Hold on my fellow bitcoin believers...the end is near. I think the pain will be over by the end of the year and then we will have a nice boring 2019 of consolidation. \n\nJust remember, every sell has a buyer, and the only ones with the balls to be buying right now are the ones that won't be selling anytime in the near future.

I was planning on using my binance account instead but they have a daily limit of only 2 btc and are going to start a kyc policy that I am sure will hurt my chances of getting away with massive deposits and withdrawals from sportsbook websites. My question is if a hardware wallet can solve this problem?? I am very ignorant on the subject. I only buy and trade bitcoin at extreme intervals (mostly a hodler) but I do trade a bit and would like an exchange open. (Gemini has threatened to shut me down if I continue my current rate of transactions without trades). With a hardware wallet can I make transactions online without the use of an exhange? That would sure solve my problems.",

            "Text": "If I had to simply put it, what was the Big Mistake by bitcoin enthusiasts, it's the following.\n\nSince the dollar has neither intrinsic value ($1 bill seems similar to $100 bill), nor apparent redemption value (you can't take the $ bill to the government and receive a golden brick)\n\nthen people conclude it has no value whatsoever. But it flies in the face of reality, where people often get mass killed over dollars.\n\nSo, then Bitcoiners concluded: \"It's just a big mass delusion. People believe USD has value, even as it doesn't. All we have to do is switch that habit to BTC.\"\n\nShocking truth: It is not true that the dollar is valueless. It possesses something that makes it valuable, and which Bitcoin doesn't possess.\n\nI could present what that is, but for the sake of keeping the post simple, I will end here. The above is the crux of where Satoshi made his mistake, which now makes Bitcoin worth nothing.",

Many people have subsidized electricity costs, or they have deals with electricity companies.  \nIn china for example, they are preparing for a new big city somewhere, so they build a dam and all that, and the electricity produced is too much for the current city, so basically they have extra power.  \nBitcoin mining looks for those places where electricity is cheapest and it's a left-over, so there is always people who can mine even if the value of bitcoin went to almost 0.\nI think this point is explained better but more eloquent people, so here:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCAJusk3dz4\n",

            "Text": "The problem is that Bitcoin mining works like normal mining. When margins are high then you get all sorts of players in the game. However, when margins get tight then all the little guys get squeezed first because they don't have the economies of scale. This then causes further consolidation as the big guys swallow up the little operations. Thus, the next time there is a boom the market is more centralised.\n\nSame thing is happening with Bitcoin mining. Whilst the margins on mining were high, every man and his dog was having a go and mining was decentralised. As this squeeze continues, the smaller operators, or operators with high overheads, are going to get squashed and hash power will centralise on to just a few players. \n\nThat's the reality and another reason why Bitcoin just can't scale effectively.",

With either, you are not at risk of exchanges going out of business, or any other issues you may encounter with them. It is important to realize though that your personal wallet is 100% your own responsibility. Loose it, or loose access to it, and you loose the coins forever, so back it up somewhere safe (just follow the wallet instructions for this). Hardware wallets are much more secure (eg Ledger or Trezor) than software wallets, but cost more, so it all comes down to how much bitcoin you have.

This turns into massive negative press and bitcoin being the eye of everyone it's performance doubles down the issue. Now people on the outside thing cyrptos dying or a scam or just something stupid that will fade into oblivion.

So it's pretty safe to say that bitcoiners are aware that gold will be deemed more valuable than Bitcoin for quite some time in the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in some regard, gold actually is worse than Bitcoin. Can't transfer it over Internet, can't really divide it. On the other hand, gold is better than Bitcoin in some aspects too - mainly for beauty, because it is so shiny and you can make jewelry out of it. (i don't personally really care for jewelry, but people obviously do, otherwise there wouldn't be such a big market for jewelry in the world) ",

So when china starts printing counterfeit USD, the dollar will become worth less unless you get it from the United States. So the US government will look for another alternative. Same thing happened with gold. People got tired of carrying heavy coins around so the dollars was created. People got tired of carrying dollars and coins around so the debit card was created. So it just a matter of time until we adopt something else.  So this is an attempt for the government to gain as many bitcoins as they can. Hodl \n\n&#x200B;",

            "Text": "nothing is scrambled, there is no encryption in bitcoin. Bitcoin uses elliptic curve cryptography, basically you have a starting point on the curve (private key) and use a one-way function to get to another point on the curve (public key). You can derive the public key from the private key but not the other way around, which means you can share your public key without risking funds. Transactions from a public address are signed using the private key ([digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature)) to show proof-of-ownership.\n\nYou are right that this itself is not what's valuable, it has been in use for a long time. The valuable thing it is used for here is that it allows people to have sole control of their bitcoin, and to send that bitcoin to someone else who can use the digital signature to independently verify that it is a valid transaction from the person who holds the private key, without needing to trust the sender or anyone else.",

It's good tech in theory and the early stages of application, but it has a lot of problems that you don't get with fiat currency or using credit.  \n\nI've seen this same response at 9K, 8K, 7K, 6K, 5K, 4K, and now in the 3K range. People like you were literally screaming to buy at 7k+ and said there was no way it was going below 7K, and if it was it would never go below 6.5K, etc.  \n\nYou have to acknowledge the flaws of the system at some point or another and the many reason that the normal person has zero reason to ever want to use crypto.  \n\nI mean, let's compare it to a credit card today. Transactions take longer, fees can be higher, taxes are a pain for many, no rewards, no consumer protections, volatile price, and the list goes on. Why would the average person want to get involved with that anytime in the near future?  \n\nI'm not arguing that crypto isn't a possible future way in the distance or that the technology isn't good, but telling people they are a fool if they don't jump on it now is just plain ignorant and shows that you have blinders on to everything else.",

How is it possible that anyone still attached to reality could think Bitcoin has failed because it can't displace a currency in 10 years? Think about that. This is not upgrading to the next version of the iPad. This is displacing the current shape of currency. It HAS to take generations.  The past ten years may be a small portion of a very long growth chart one day. Judging the future on such a small portion of early growth is futile.",

            "Text": "You're missing all of it.  \nBlocks are supposed to be mined every 10 minutes. Based on the hashrate of the network (based on how much mining the miners are mining), the difficulty to find a block increases or decreases. This change happens every 2016 blocks, but I'll go back to it later.  \nAfter 10 minutes, whoever found the solution to the very difficult problem, will be rewarded 12.5 bitcoin. This doesn't change, except for a thing called \"the halvening\", every 4 years or so, the block reward halves. It started as 50 BTC, then 25 BTC, now it's at 12.5 BTC (every 10 minutes).  \nNow about the hashrate. The difficulty is calculated every 2016 blocks (or something like that, like a week or whatever), and then all the miners look for the solution, one finds it every 10 minutes. This is just an average, sometimes a block could take 1 hour, sometimes 3 blocks can be mined within 2 minutes.  \nNow let's assume that HALF the miners suddenly stopped mining.  \nWell, since the difficulty is adjusted every X blocks, we still have to find those blocks, and it will take twice as long to reach the 2016 blocks. But it will be reached. Then the difficulty will be adjusted DOWN by a lot, and then it will be profitable for more miners to mine it. \nBut why didn't half of the miners stop mining if it wasn't profitable?  \nWell, like I mentioned before in another post, electricity is not valued the same everywhere, so some miners will always mine no matter what.  \n\nIn your last paragraph, yes, it will take the same machine still 3 days to mine it (until difficulty adjusts). But the total bitcoins mined till date have no relation with difficulty, except about how close we are to the next difficulty adjustment.",

When it was locked into that 6200-6500 channel for a few months, I really thought that there would be one juicy run towards 7500 before the bottom dropped out again and then it would level off in the 5800 neighborhood. That would have been consistent with the trading pattern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last drop was weird in the sense that the price was stuck in the same channel for so long, and then the bottom dropped out without a pump. My \\*guess\\* is that there had been price manipulation to sustain the 6200-6500 channel, and then when that sustaining price support went away it was like releasing the trapdoor and the bottom simply fell out to current levels. Since that price support went away around the same time as the Ver/Faketoshi fork drama, I have my suspicions as to who had been behind it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProbably five years from now there will be some interesting books that talk about price manipulation in crypto, and Bitcoin in particular.",

It\u2019s the trustless system of storage and exchange which is valuable. Some people are willing to offer goods and services (or fiat) for a unit in this system-of-exchange, because they know that they can then use this system to exchange that unit for another good/service/fiat for themselves, from someone else who also uses the system of exchange. The more people which take part in it (speculation or otherwise), the higher the demand for the fixed amount of units is, and hence the higher the value of each unit.\n\nThat\u2019s all it boils down to, an agreed-upon medium of wealth storage and exchange. Whether you value it (and hence offer goods/services for it) or not is up to you.\n\nedit: spelling",

Look how people react when the price goes up or down a lot. Then, look how people react when crypto technology makes an improvement. Look at the articles written in all the popular websites visited by a large number of people. They are mostly about the price of it, not the philosophy behind it.  \n\nIt's perfectly fine to be in it because you believe in it at it's core, but it's also important to realize that most everyone else isn't. The moment they begin to lose more money than they were comfortable risking, they are out.",

The term shit coin was created to refer to the hundreds of alt coins created ONLY to try and emulate bitcoin's success. They never made it past the whitepaper! So consider that bitcoin's price is a result of whatever people are willing to pay for it.... but it's the exact same technology regardless of market noise. \n\nThe dev community will contiue to improve it and it may or may not evolve into a mainstream currency. But make no mistake the speculated price tag has shown beyond any doubt that the market price has NOTHING to do with the technology. \n\nDo you think Bitcoin improved anything last November to justify 20k? Did it have a major tech failure to justify a 90% price drop? No to both! So my point is simple - price does not reflect the potential of the technology. It reflects speculation. To say bitcoin will be 100k by Dec was pure speculation and borderline insane, and to say it will go to 0 is equally as ludicrous.",

Maybe that was the bottom until faketoshie and everything going on with bcash, or maybe it would have taken another step down anyways, there's really no way to know since the value is based on whatever anyone is willing to pay.\nBitcoin is creeping into more corners of life and will probably continue to grow for a long time to come. \n\nThe value of Bitcoin will largely be a result of how much wealth people choose to hold in it. That 'could' over time, allow it to function as a currency and value store. Add to that the potential of the same system that stores the value having the technology to transfer it anywhere quick and cheap, and retain a single global equality - then you've got the beginnings of a successful Bitcoin. Either way, we're years away from that point. For now it's a market where people can line up to place their bets and hopefully, make themselves a little profit.",

            "Text": ">was proving that bitcoin is unlike gold\n\nYea yea I know, bad context. but it kind of ties in to your general question of why bitcoin has value at all in your top post. If you take away the belief / agreement / assumption / assertion that fiat is wealth, why would fiat be wealth? Why would your mate take $5 for a slice of cake?\n\nbitcoin is wealth because people have agreed, independently from governments, that bitcoin is wealth. The lack of government enforcement (taxation) doesn't mean an agreement of what is wealth can't be made amongst a group of people. Some people specifically want to make an agreement which lacks government involvement, and which involves something far more practical and easier to get out of the country than gold. Others don't, which is fine.",

Cool. But you really have no grounds to argue it other than your opinion which is one of many and not particularly relevant here. \n\nedit: For context I'll explain this in terms of gold. \n\nYou can buy a 12 Kg bar of gold for roughly $500,000.\n\nBut WHO IS GOING TO PAY $500,000 for ONE lump of gold?!?!?! The answer - very few people. But many people are willing to pay for 1kg bars, and 10 oz. bars, and 1 oz. bars..... those sell just fine. Why?\n\nNow assume 1 BTC is equivalent to a 12Kg. bar of gold. Yes with high market prices fewer and fewer people are buying lumps that large - but since Bitcoin is divisible like gold (even more so and easier) the market price is irrelevant in terms of lump sums. \n\nYou're getting caught up on the whole unit of 1 BTC. Look it it from the perspective of mBtc, satoshis etc. And it's not very hard to imagine at all. ",

It can be a push payment system, and a store of value for a future society (assuming the volatility has dissipated) that will likey embrace such a digital ledger.

May have a couple of more dramatic bull/bear runs. I predict $100k bitcoin by May 1, 2021 or sooner. \n\n2) mid term potential (6-10 years hence) begins to be used by early adopters as a currency as adoption increases. Price continues to rise significantly, but more slowly. Still a good investment opportunity. Might hit mcafee\u2019s one million prediction in this time range if bitcoin continues to prosper. \n\n3) long term potential (11+ years hence) - mass adoption as a currency and store of value (like gold). Volatility at this point would be negligible as it continues to very slowly rise due to deflation. Governments will also begin using it to make huge cross border transactions. \n\n\nThe only forecast I am very confident in is #1. I hope #2 and #3 happen. Time will tell. ",

You could have argued that a horse > car...at first, post mail > email...at first, Well > town water and sewer..at first...etc etc. Your accountant won't be better than a matured bitcoin in 10-20 years.\n\nBanks and credit cards are already working, but again things improve over time and all I'm saying is that I believe bitcoin can easily surpass these current services. Also, as I mentioned, new digital generation may prefer bitcoin as it would align more closely to their digital society.\n\nSo, if you enjoy debating then I respect that. But if you're just here to insult then it's a waste of time.
