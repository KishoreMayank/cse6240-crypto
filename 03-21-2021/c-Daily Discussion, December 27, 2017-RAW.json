Bitcoin isn't like anything you've ever traded in.  10%, 20%, even 30% price swings in a day, in either direction, are completely normal.  It hasn't \"started to recover only to crash as soon as it gained a little\", it's just sliding sideways with normal day-to-day volatility.\n\nBuckle up and enjoy the ride.",

I'm not talking Roger Ver level scam, I mean pure likely-to-go-to-jail scam.\n\n3 guys, with no crypto background, new github account fake profiles and a lot of marketing power have either managed to bribe or fool crypto media e.g.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hard-fork-take-two-segwit2x-will-return-dec-28-says-founder\nhttps://themerkle.com/segwit2x-to-be-reborn-in-coming-weeks-ahead/\nand many [others](https://www.google.com/search?q=segwit2x+fork&tbm=nws&source=lnt&tbs=qdr:w&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxgryVuKnYAhUJRN8KHe5jCRAQpwUIHg&biw=1920&bih=959&dpr=1\n\nSimply looking at their linked-in profiles should be enough. This has NOTHING to do with the Jeff Garzik crusade to reinvent bitcoin with no replay protection.\n\nThe brilliance is that they claim massive support by pointing to outdated exchange and other posts referring the since abandoned segwit2x fork.\n\nSee below for some additional analysis on why this is obviously a boiler room operation.\n\nMeanwhile Coinbase has seen a mass exodus of BTC\n\nDue to high volume, we are experiencing a backlog of outgoing transactions for BTC and ETH.\n\nRemember that the same thing happened with Bitcoin Cash late July, 2017. So What? Bitcoin did fine afterwards right?\n\nThis and the other dozen brazen attempts to mislead and co-opt \"bitcoin\" is causing traffic, temporarily driving up the bitcoin price and will probably attract some seedy miners, exchanges or other legitimate bitcoin resources.\n\nUninformed will lose money, resources will be siphoned, media will jump on the hype and the stench will affect all of us. This is making Roger Ver and Bcash smell like perfume! We have gotten to a new low akin to shifting from military conflict to terrorism.\n\nPlease add constructive comments and do your best to warn people and consider that, although unjustified, this kind of scam will affect everyone in the crypto space.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@hackology/segwit2x-comes-back-as-scam2x-c1c71a91f1c9 https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinScamCoins/comments/7kumld/b2x_segwit2x_hard_fork_bitcoin_scammers_trying_to/ https://www.reddit.com/r/segwit2x/comments/7m7xb2/who_is_behind_this_i_have_a_very_bad_feeling/\n\nhttps://blog.drhack.net/segwit2x-28-december-scam/",

I realized I made a mistake and contacted Coinbase support (No Response).\n   As of last week Coinbase began implementing BCH (Limited) support. Under their FAQ page they describe that \n> Any BCH sent to your Coinbase account addresses has been credited to your new BCH wallet.\n\nHowever, I never received my BCH into my BCH wallet (As of 12/27/18). The BTC wallet I originally sent it to was [1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3). As you can see, the transaction was confirmed under the SAME BCH Wallet address.\n\nI had been tracking this transaction as it stated the funds had not been spent... up until 12/20/17. What happened on 12/20/17? I sent 0.00349 **BTC** to the same exact address on my Coinbase Wallet. [See confirmed transactions](https://blockchain.info/address/1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3). I wanted to make sure this address did in fact belong to me, and I was right. The transaction went through and I have that BTC in my wallet right now.\nHowever, If you look at the original transaction, you can see that the whole 0.14967 of BCH was moved to a new BCH address [13CQW2huoWaq3qzwz6ybAXkEX4FwskygH8](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/13CQW2huoWaq3qzwz6ybAXkEX4FwskygH8) at the same time I sent BTC to my BTC wallet on coinbase.\n\nSo... Can someone explain what happened?\n\nHere's a timeline\n\n* 11/13/17 - 0.14967 BCH > 1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3 (BTC Wallet on Coinbase)\n* 12/20/17 5:20 pm - 0.00349 BTC > 1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3 (BTC Wallet on Coinbase)\n* 12/20/17 8:17 pm - 0.14967 BCH > 13CQW2huoWaq3qzwz6ybAXkEX4FwskygH8 (Unknown Wallet)",

I didn\u2019t know you could transfer to a wallet from Gdax without a fee. I\u2019m just a noob tryna learn! ",

            "Text": "1) A fork is just an update to the rules that are used to validate transactions. We actually \"fork\" all the time, whenever there are changes to the rules, however if they're rules that we all agree on then the old fork disappears. In the case of bcash and other coins that we call forks, there was a change in rules that a significant amount of people didn't agree on, so when the rules came out (ie double block size for bcash) both forks lived because both had support. \n\n\n2) It's weird to think about why the forked coin is worth anything, but yes, one way to think of it is the thought that it will become the \"new\" Bitcoin. In a way, they take their value out of the value of Bitcoin, because if nobody supported them then there would be that much more demand for Bitcoin and it would be more valuable. So even if one doesn't ever become the new Bitcoin but continues to be used, it still has value, the same way any altcoin has value. \n\n\n3) When you own the private keys to your wallet and the blockchain forks, both chains report you having a balance. So you can spend your Bitcoin balance, but the forked chain, for example bcash, still reports your old balance that you had at the time of forking. If your coins were stored in an exchange at the time of forking, that exchange has your coins in both forks as well, and can choose to give them to you if they want to, but there's no way to make them do so. \n\n\n4) There will be more forks in the future, and it's not guaranteed that exchanges will give them to you, so yes if you want to make sure you get those coins so you can sell them off for a little extra value, you should store them in a hardware wallet (or anywhere that you own the private keys). In fact, as I'm sure you've read, you shouldn't be storing your coins on an exchange long term anyway. ",

            "Text": "Forks happen when there is a software upgrade, or an ideological difference. BCash -> Bigger Blocks, Bitcoin Gold -> Decentralised mining with a different non-ASIC algorithm.\n\nYou can reclaim the new coins if you have access to a Private Key, hence the paper wallet or hardware wallet requirement.\n\nAccording to Andreas: None of the coins are actually worth anything, it's the belief, the authority, that provides the value. Bitcoin has the greatest minds in crypto involved in its development.\n\nTake all the YouTube comments with a grain of salt, the Hardware Wallet maker, might've paid this Channel for some promotional work. Jurisdictions, like the UK, require the channels to put \"Paid Content/Promotion/Partnership\" and \"AD\" in their videos. Look up Global Cycling Network's channel and you'll see the \"AD\" in the video thumbnails.",

            "Text": "The blocksize limit in the real Bitcoin was increased just a few months ago (that's why almost every block these days is larger than 1MB). So yes, it is possible.\n\nWhat these other coins (like Cash, Diamond, Gold, and B2X) are doing is launching \"airdrop altcoins\" (there's an entire subreddit dedicated to these things: /r/BitcoinAirdrops) because it is a very low-effort way of gaming the \"market cap\" metric and making an altcoin seem much bigger and more important than it really is.\n\nIn order to upgrade the consensus rules of the *real* Bitcoin (in a backwards-incompatible way), you have to convince all the other Bitcoin users to adopt your change, which means your change will have to be an *obvious* improvement to the existing rules. So far, no one has come up with such a change or upgrade, so instead, they are launching altcoins and trying to market them rather than technically improving on the codebase.\n\nIncidentally, increasing the blocksize does the *opposite* of \"easing the workload\"; it actually would *increase* the workload of each node on the network (inevitably forcing some to shut down because things get too expensive). That is a big reason why so many of us Bitcoiners don't want to do it. It is a \"dumb\" way to try to scale, and we have *actual* (smart) solutions being developed that keep things lightweight and efficient while *also* providing the possibility of instant and extremely-cheap transactions to those who want these things.\n\nFinally, the \"cheap transactions\" of most altcoins (like those airdrop coins) is mostly a function of their lack of demand (or in some cases lack of decentralization); think about it as if there were two restaurants, one of which served delicious and healthy food while the other served nasty food that not many people want to eat. Of course, the line of people waiting to get into the good restaurant is going to be long (and if it's a \"pay to enter\" policy, the fees people are paying to get in will be relatively high), whereas the line to get into the bad restaurant would be nonexistent and you could get in for free, at any time. That's basically what is happening here. And no matter how big the bad restaurant makes its building, it won't mean the food is any better (even if it hypothetically *could* fit more customers if any ever chose to go there).",

You don't need to send your Bitcoin anywhere because as long as you own Bitcoin prior to any fork, you can always \"redeem\" the forked coins by using a wallet that supports the new coin/token.  With that in mind, it is always a good idea to keep your coins/tokens off the exchange so that you have control over your private keys/seed words.\n\n2. I have no idea where this claim of \"Satoshi's Bitcoin\" comes from, but I fear that is total bullshit.  How would anyone give away BTC from Satoshi's wallet(s)? I really don't see how that is possible unless Satoshi him/herself would send each individual some BTC.",

Once the private key/seed words are generated, they will work on any wallet (there are exceptions), so that means that you can use 10 different wallets and have the same balance displayed in those 10 different wallets as long as you use the seed words to restore access for that wallet to the blockchain. You have to remember, the wallet doesn't actually hold any balance of tokens locally, all it does is it gives you access to browse the blockchain. Of course you can use 10 wallets and have them generate NEW private keys and then you will have 10 different addresses that you can transfer BTC/tokens around.  With regards to Jaxx, if the B2X token becomes popular, Jaxx will eventually add support for it. If it is a shitcoin, they probably won't bother.",

            "Text": "It has almost nothing to do with the technology, and Bitcoin had zero-fees for the first 4-5 years of its existence, too.\n\nInstead, the \"cheap transactions\" of most altcoins is mostly a function of their lack of demand (or in some cases lack of decentralization); think about it as if there were two restaurants, one of which served delicious and healthy food while the other served nasty food that not many people want to eat. Of course, the line of people waiting to get into the good restaurant is going to be long (and if it's a \"pay to enter\" policy, the fees people are paying to get in will be relatively high), whereas the line to get into the bad restaurant would be nonexistent and you could get in for free, at any time. That's basically what is happening here. And no matter how big the bad restaurant makes its building, it won't mean the food is any better (even if it hypothetically *could* fit more customers if any ever chose to go there).\n\nCentralized systems can have cheap fees forever. Decentralized networks without significant levels of demand or usage can have cheap fees forever. Insecure decentralized networks can have cheap fees forever. Secure and decentralized networks with significant levels of demand or usage can have cheap fees forever if they also subsidize security through inflation perpetually.\n\nDecentralized networks *with* significant levels of demand and usage which also have a finite supply cap *can* (in theory) have cheap fees without breaking their value proposition *if and only if* there are intelligently-engineered solutions augmenting their functionality to this end. Such solutions are being developed (and just now beginning to be used, in some cases), but this is not an overnight revolution, and it's important to remember how young the space still is. We're basically where the Internet was in 1996-1997, and while great things are being built, the Bitcoin equivalent to Google Maps and Netflix and Spotify aren't quite here yet.",

Lets follow this train: you have $100 worth of BTC, you sell/trade for ETH, you pay that trade fee to the exchange (I don't know how much it is, but it COULD be more then a typical BTC transaction fee), you transfer your ETH to another exchange/address, the fee is low indeed. Then you need to purchase BTC with your ETH and you also pay a trade/buy fee (unless you are using limit orders, etc) which could cost some amount. In the end, you may end up paying more fees this route than just sending the BTC to another BTC address.  Now, you can also use an exchange that supports Segwit (Gemini for example) and send your BTC using that exchange to a Segwit enabled wallet/address, and pay tiny fees..  many confusing options here, I know, but this is the wild wild west of crypto currently.",

The next night, I decided I'd look into actually getting some (first foray into altcoins) and by the time I woke up the next day, it was skyrocketing! \n\nI took a risk and got in at about 45 cents and have held strong, totally amazed at it hitting 1.25 when BTC was plummeting. I exchanged ~$585 worth of BTC/LTC, and right now it's worth nearly $1600.  I'm going to hodl any coins I come into, but I'd also be interested in the feedback to trilll's question.",

Since the exchange doesn't give you access to those, you will need to move your BTC to a wallet that allows access to the private keys/seed words and then you will need to use the seed words on a wallet that supports the forked coin/token to \"redeem\" said tokens. I may have been wrong in my previous reply.. Basically if you keep the coins on the exchange, you will not be able to \"redeem\" the forked coins unless the exchange starts supporting the coin. So, I would just move the tokens off the exchange to ensure you have access to your private keys/seed words.",

Yeah the git revelation is self evident, they haven't provided any explanation except \"distributing the coins to our partners\" which basically means paying off exchanges to list their coin.
