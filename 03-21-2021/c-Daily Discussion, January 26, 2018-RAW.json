I mean, I get that whoever is short (some wallstreet guys) stands to benefit from the price going down. But for each person in a futures contract that is short, their has to be someone on the other side of the contract (some wallstreet guys) that are long, right? It's zero sum. One wallstreet guy wins, and the other loses?  So how would the short wallstreet guys be manipulating the price down?

Its funny how the WSJ had an article about the fact that your friends and family don't want to hear about your Bitcoin fascination anymore and now people like me don't want to talk about it anymore anyway.  I've already made my investment and know for a fact that at least in the long term between my BTC or ETH, one of those will at the very least double in price from these levels.  And That is absolutely the worst case scenario and most unlikely.  A more probable scenario is that both of those coins and others will do very well.   \n\nIn addition, the main reason i was telling people about crypto in the first place is because i see it as an amazing financial opportunity and would feel guilty not telling ppl about it.  Well I tried that, and now the WSJ is saying shut up too.  Good thing is now i won't feel guilty when this shit starts to get real again.  Perhaps in a few weeks....",

The exchanges I signed up for asked for strict ID verification and I wouldn't know how to get $10 into the system and 'launder' it. Cash, however, if accepted by say a car dealer or like here in Sydney by builders, is very easy to launder by buying goods or services using cash and theb reselling. I am seriously struggling to see any damaging regulation in the cryptocurrency market that's constitutional. Some regulation, and thereby acceptance and stability, may be good for the overall market.",

Though I guess if there are lots of people only using bitcoin amounts there is no need to convert to another currency. ",

The majority of the population just doesn't give a shit.  They are fine having an authority control their water, food, air, money, and even their Daylight Savings (kudos to V. Buterin for that twitter post).  \n\nYes I'm being sarcastic but also half serious.  The average person really doesn't give shit about the use cases and potential game changing technology behind Bitcoin and others.  They like to Get in Line, be told what to do, work \"their\" jobs and always take it up the ass deeper and deeper.\n\nI imagine a big reason people invested in this space like me is because they are sick and tired of the old legacy elite power systems.  Obvious its the big reason Bitcoin was created in the first place., but the problem is will the Sheep ever wake the f up!  Or they gonna be like cool, the Fed released a Digital currency, my boss is like you want lame ass dollars or the new fed coin man!  Yea! Hey Johnny sorry about your Bitcoin, this Fed Coin is so cool, its like cash without a bank account and I don't have to think for myself.  ",

            "Text": "It's because crypto is a method of money laundering that is potentially lossless. That is if you convert US$1M into a crypto you can convert it back into US$1M without necessarily taking a hit. This is not true of other avenues such as casinos or a front business. Combine this with the fact that the volatility in the market gives an excellent means of justifying unexplained wealth which is the whole point of money laundering. The only other markets that give this sort of opportunity are property, stocks and currency trading and all of these are heavily regulated. As there is more liquidity in the crypto market then the problem will only get worse as it will be easier and easier to hide.",

My guess is that since the blockchain will only see the opening and closing transactions for a lightning network session, you'll only get an aggregate summary of transactions from the blockchain itself. \n\nBut it will still be possible to take the LN wallet's history and use that to see your transactions aswell. That level of detail just won't be available to everybody via the blockchain.",

            "Text": "> That refers to stock in public companies that are undervalued based on their revenues and profits, not imaginary internet money tokens....lol.\n\nIt looks like you need to do some reading, Bitcoin\u2019s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.\nIf you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to \"ban\" it.\n\nCheck out this great articles and video: \n\nWhat Gave Bitcoin Its Value?\n\nhttps://fee.org/articles/what-gave-bitcoin-its-value/\n\n\"How do Bitcoins have value?\"\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-do-Bitcoins-have-value/answer/David-Strayhorn\n\nWhy we value Bitcoin\n\nhttps://mjslawson.com/2017/12/01/bitcoin/why-we-value-bitcoin/\n\n\u201cHow to value a bitcoin (Metcalfe\u2019s Law)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-Vjgx75GXQ\n\n\n",

            "Text": "> ow does Tether (or any crypto) create something that is worthless and then use it to buy Bitcoin? Doesn't somebody have to sell their Bitcoin for said worthless coin? If they are selling it, doesn't that mean the seller sees value in the coin?\n\nIt uses a big exchange to move the money around. If bitfinex went down, no USDT would enter the market today. There might be an expectation of solvency much like there was with Mt.Gox for a long time while it was already insolvent and nobody knew about it.\n\nWhen that expectation ends, the price of Tether would drop significantly and at that point you will get a crypto-run. Just because its done 'voluntarily' doesn't mean its correct or reliable. I'm honestly surprised kraken shows such stable Tether values considering the source. You would expect a company with no audit and no buyback of tethers (because you cant trade them) to have a preimum for risk and yet its almost parity.\n\nAlso bear in mind that if bitcoin's utility has a natural value for today (lets call it n) and tether printing makes it above this value, the market will always tend to sell, and thus the necessity to print money to keep the price up will not stop until n increases to the current price. \n\nI'm not a trader, but I'm buying into this FUD, I don't see how this can end up well.

Tether has only been able to get away with this stunt for so long because people are greedy and are trying to use it to avoid the tax man. The interesting thing to watch will be how fast the exchanges pull support for USDT when it all starts turning to custard. I'm guessing they have their own stop loss in place which means if USDT drops below around US$0.95 they'll suspend trading and their customers will be left holding the bag.

LN and segwit gives us a chance to say \"well maybe someday\" but that someday isn't today. It will crash lower than it is now, it has no other option. That doesn't mean today's a bad day to invest, it just makes it a much higher risk than most investments.\n\nNot to mention (from my own observations) the community largely has no idea how any of this works and are buying in because they want a 10x ROI. Novice investors + bad investment practices + general confusion = something bad.",

However, if you look at the last 3 months then it is definitely bouncing lower. As soon as it escapes the denial phase and hits the fear phase, the drop will be something else. The other problem is that Tether has introduced systemic risk. It is not easy to convert BTC into fiat which means people will initially try to use USDT as a safe haven but this will expose the mirage. At that point the wheels will really fall off as the exchanges will collapse. Harvard business school is going to have years of material out of this little adventure.",

I have invested in Stellar an amount i can live with losing. Basically my philosophy is \"I can stand to lose n but I can't stand to miss out on n times 100.\" I was in tech in San Francisco and Silicon valley during the early days of the internet. I had money to invest but instead I spent it on art and vespas and living large. Kind of regret it although good times were had.

Repeatedly buying into the same investment is usually a sign of an investor who is spending too much money on his investment. \n\nEasy example: You start off buying $1000 worth of Bitcoin. The price dips two weeks later, so you buy another $500. The price again dips in another few weeks, so you buy another $500. So you originally planned on only spending $1000, but now you've ended up spending $2000 because your emotions got the best of you. This is bad investing, you can't slice it any other way. If you were confident and could afford to spend $2000, you should have spent $2000 at the start. If you couldn't afford $2000 at the start, you're now deviating from your investment goals and you're spending too much money.",
