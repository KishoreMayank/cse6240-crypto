            "Text": "Anyone have any LND configuration advice? Been running almost a week on autopilot, ran into several already documented bugs like trying to make channels without accounting for fees. My biggest problem is I can't for the life of me get any bidirectional or incoming channels. I resorted to spending on one of my autopilot created outgoing channels, but apparently there is no route from any popular services to that channel and thus me either. I manually added the most connected nodes as peers hoping they would connect to me if I did them but no dice. I can't for the life of me accept incoming lightning payments without a routing error.\n\nHow can I configure lnd autopilot to only make bidirectional channels or encourage peers to make incoming channels?",

Since then I am increasing my coin whenever there is spare money to spend, buying in at 9k, then 6k, and now 4k.\n\nUp to this stage my average BTC price is 5.5k. And I would easy make a 200% return when BTC is 11k.\n\nStill I am greedy and selfish and I wish BTC have another year of bear run, allowing strong hands like us to accumulate more. When my average BTC cost is 3.5k, a BTC bullrun towards a mere 7k is already yielding me a 200% return.\n\nCan't wait for another paycheck to come in. Cheers.",

What would happen if Satoshi Nakamoto (the person/entity/group) would reappear and prove that he still is in control of the coins we know are his. By moving them or signing a message in relashioship with their public address. It would greatly increase the current available supply and should drive the price down.\n\nBut in all seriousness, the person/entity/group behind Satoshi nakamoto is most likely dead or not in control anymore of those adress. How would you HODL so much BTC after such a crazy appreciation is humanely impossible. Everyone has bill to pay, everyone has a price for such a early retirement opportunity.\n\n",
