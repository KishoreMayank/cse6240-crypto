I saw yesterday on Bitfinex some market spoofing around 6 p.m. UTC time.. \nwhy I am saying this? Because first of all, bitcoin came as a result on market manipulation, corrupt banking system and widespread injustice on financial market back in 2008.\nRecently, it was often heard that cryptocurrencies markets do not need a regulation, and it was raising a red flag to me. Because it is like saying we do not need cops.. well, guess who will come then, and who would rule? Yes, gangs and criminals.\nWell, with such liquid market and possible high gains, it was a call to those kinds of people.. and cryptocurrency society didn't do anything to regulate itself, but instead of that, YT is full of videos tagged with #Lambo, #toTheMoon, etc..\n\nI personally think this is a last call to regulate things properly, or hand over those markets to various sharks and people like Soros, Rotschild, Rockefeller and others.

If you are waiting for a really low bottom then you have about a week or so, safer to just buy now because it doesn't look like it can get much lower. It has tried many times. The only reason it can get lower then 6.5k now is if a huge whale tries to FUD everyone so they can buy even lower before May. Jus my two cents. You can check out last year's early April and see for yourself, it was pretty much sideways too just like now.\n\nIn addition to that, The lowest last year's April fell was just about the price of their previous November Which is where we about stand right now. Our price is matching November's price. It shouldn't get much lower even if it does. So buy or miss the train. Again just my opinion and guess. I am 50% sure that I am 100% right. LOL",

Personally i think its mainly neural net bots moving btc price in random ways right now, squeezing money out of the market by wild manipulation and tricks.  Sadly its seems most of the market atm. The only thing which attributed to the big rise last year was so many fomo chumps entering the market.  The chumps are now gone, uninterested and burned.  Without a big paradigm shift in tech i dont see them coming back.  And thats years away at best...  so i cant see a turnaround anytime soon. And taking it one step further, if we\u2019re this shakey on no news, what happens when some bad news comes out?  I think another tank is far more likely than another moon at this point.\nI still own bitcoin so not trying to \u2018fud\u2019 or whatever. Just speaking my honest mind.",

I love bitcoin, what it stands for and want to see it replace fiat but until that happens, I'll make some money. It's a better strategy then bitching about losses. Nothing I can do about the state of the market. And since very few are willing to weather the storm and hodl at this point (volume speaks volumes) you just have to go with the trends until we reach capitulation and turn this bitch around.",

            "Text": "It's not pump and dump.  It's market fluctuations as a result of the interaction between short and long term moving averages on various time scales.  The market oscillates at different frequencies that can be seen on the different charts.  The base oscillation is on the 1m time scale which is 20-40 dollar fluctuations.  The next oscillation is on the 5m time scale with 40-100 point swings.  The next on the 15m time scale swings by 100-200 points, and on the 1h time scale, you'll see oscillations like we just had around 200-500 points.  We haven't seen an upswing on the 6h time scale (which may swing 500-2000 points or more) for a while, but we're nearing the bottom of the curve on that.  To see the curves, look at short and long term moving averages on each chart.  When the short term average crosses over the long term average on the 1hr chart is the time to buy (this will happen when the short term average on the 15m, 5m, and 1m charts are all above their long term averages).  Knowing when to sell is trickier, but basically it's when it's clear the short term average on the 6hr chart will not cross the long term average on that chart (because if that happens and you sold early, the market will jump 500-2000 points up and you won't ride it).  Now, watch the market for a few days and see if it doesn't all make sense, and if you can't predict if it will go up or down at any given time.",

This makes it seem like a lot of people sold. No way to be sure.\n\nYou can tell how much was sold from the chart. Around 175,000 BTC moved on GDAX to cause that price drop, if I'm reading it correctly.",

            "Text": "Well the thing is (Yes downvote me all if you want) many people here just do not understand how markets work.\nThey think TA is bullshit and blame whales for manipulating the price every time it drops. The drop we see right now is just natural market movement. Remember 2013 Price droped from 1200 to 200 and could not get up again until 2015.\nRight now the weekly chart is showing extremly bearish signals and we are up for another 4 weeks of going down. But eventually everything is going to line up, we are going to hit a resistance line and we are going to go up again. If you want to know we have one at 5k, 3900 and 1300.\nThese drops and then rises are just something you have to be able to deal with if you are trading bitcoin.\nThe fact that bitcoin does not give a fuck about bad news does also mean it does not give a fuck about good news  (i am speaking of long term development the China ban was not able to crash it for long just as the G20 news were not able to bounce it for long) .\nOr that it is not bound to things like a huge company or backed by a goverment. Long term this is good and will lead to bitcoins success but short term it is one of the reasons we have so much volatility. \nI am a bitcoin long term believer but in the shortterm there is just nothing bullish to be seen in the bitcoin price. \nNow you can downvote me and tell me how wrong i am in the meantime i am going to trade and increase my bitcoin stash just how i did very succsesfully since the beginning of the year. \nEdit: it is very well possible that those 4 weeks of downside transform into another 7 months but nothing is ever writen in stone. Allways keep an eye open on the price and re evaluate your trading strategy acordingly ",

He was the founder of the \u041c\u041c\u041c.\n\nIn 2007 Sergei Mavrodi was convicted in a Russian court of defrauding 10,000 investors out of 110 million rubles ($4.3 million). Mavrodi claimed he was not the beneficiary of the donations and that he was not used to a flamboyant lifestyle. The charge of which he was later convicted was tax fraud though he claimed that the MMM scheme was not a business, but instead a mutual donation program which there is no law against.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Any soul out there can just get on reddit, enter a sub and state \"opinions\" when in reality they are just parroting. \n\nThe noise is real and I firmly believe that this misinformation will continue to spread. Anyone who don't care about their money will be the only ones making financial decisions based entirely on something someone said on reddit, and they'll never know whether they failed or succeded out of luck or by listening to the right person. If you're smart and care about your money, make a plan for how much you are willing to invest, your minimum worthwhile ROI, and based on that, find what you want to invest in, be it crypto or something more stable. I'll say this again, just in case: make your own decisions, plain and simple. \n\nEDIT: I parodied above poster, since they deleted their post I should mention that this post was a parody more than anything else. I stand by forming own opinions and making own decisions tho. ",

There's no new money coming into the market, only bots trading sideways.  The symptom of this is that it does not move upwards with good news (as it should).  It only moves down when bad things happen (and bot owners pull their money out)\n\nSo as you've just pointed out, until the market starts reacting to good news there's only one way this can go in the short term.  Sadly its further down : (\n\nwould really like to be wrong...",

While everyone else is crying in their beer and there is gnashing of teeth and wailing in streets I am buying. \n\nI am up. Not down on my longs. \n\nIt's very simple. The market went parabolic. You get out, you wait for the crash, then you buy. It's been 4 months since the start of the crash. We have higher lows. We're testing major resistance. Yeah there's going to be a fight here. But basically it's time for the next move up. If nothing else. \n\nThere might be a little more downside. It is frustrating. But it is definitely not the end of the world.  ",

            "Text": "$5.9K is such a cowardly price. The only reason you set that price is because that\u2019s the Feb. 05 bottom. But do you even realize the total crytocurrrency market cap is about $25 billion less than that Feb. 05 bottom? Technically, you should be out now since overall market cap is far more indicative than Bitcoin\u2019s price. The $5.9K price is completely arbitrary. Bitcoin\u2019s next bottom could be $4.2K or $6.3K. For you, if Bitcoin bottoms at $5.9K again (which it won\u2019t) and then springs back up to $40K, you\u2019ve lost big. This is why there are only 3 types of winners in this bear market: (1) the traders who set buy-stop-orders, (2) the whales and (3) the HODLers. Everyone else will be a loser including yourself who lose faith in Bitcoin once it hits some arbitrary low that was established based on nothing. And I doubt you will be out. You\u2019re an emotional dramaqueen so you\u2019ll definitely be back once Bitcoin is bullish again.",

The main problem is you never have enough money for it. I estimate I'd need at least $2 mil to make it work at a level where I could happily live of it mainly because the volatility is so low. You don't get the constant value changes you get here. So it would have to sit and putter around for a few years before you can really rely on it for income. \n\nBut here if you're awake you can make that in a few months. So there's really no point in even bothering with forex again. \n\nAnd of course Oanda stopped offering their JAVA API and I just wasn't going to recode all of that again. Third time they do this to me. So I just stopped, transferred all my funds into Crypto. \n\nYou just can't pull these kind of figures you get here out of fx. ",

When the red crosses above the grey on the 15m chart you see an uptick in buying because that signifies a market upturn and the daytraders buy in to make their profits.  As the red drops below the gray you see a lot of selling as the daytraders know the market is done going up, so they sell out to buy the next upswing.  When these reversals happen on the 1hour, 6hour, and 1 day charts you get massive movements up and down as more people buy in on a long term reversal than on the shorter term reversals.  Whales don't exist doing the things the ignorant individuals here think they do to swing the market up and down.  These are just daytraders who contribute to mass buy ins and sell offs when the market reverses on different wavelengths creating these swings.",

Now with all the OTC derivative exposure the top 5 banks have, if one goes, they all go. \n\nAnd banks can do bail-in's in the entire western hemisphere legally. It was legalised globally 3 months after the Cyprus event. Basically your money can be confiscated at will at this point.  \n\nSo when that happens, if you start getting bank runs. Where do people go ? Where's the safest place you move assets into in a hurry ? It's probably crypto. Gold is useless. Last time we had this the US government simply confiscated it. Maybe assets in broker house will be ok. But I'd sure like some crypto in hand mainly because it's outside of the system. It's not easy to confiscate in bulk unlike money in a bank account. \n\nSo I think it might be good for Crypto. And remember every now and then the world does change financial systems. Last one was the tally system in Europe. \n\nWe're going into this crises with a new option. ",

If I can get it up to 10% growth per month with a relatively low drawdown, you can make a good living trading other peoples accounts. You just need to build up a good long track record. Already had a couple of inquiries but I am happy to potter along just for myself. I used to code trading bots on MT4. However I didn't have enough patience back them to run them long enough to see if they were gong to be profitable. Always tinkering and changing them and deleting them and getting pissed off with paying for the Forex server to run them 24 hrs on. Anyhow once I realized that a longer time frame (Daily or weekly) charts suited my personality better, I in turn became a better trader. Don't need bots for longer frame charts, just pending orders. Haven't done a market order in ages.",

That's not a situation buyers wants.  \n\nOTC purchases mean the price is way more predictable.

Trade on paper before using real money (give yourself an imaginary purse of as much as you plan to put in and make some imaginary trades for a few days/weeks). Then, realize in real life it's harder to make your buys and sells at the prices you want than you'd think, as you need to avoid fees as much as possible.  Requires predicting how much the market will swing so you can set up the transactions ahead of time.  There are also more market cues to pay attention to than I can go into detail on, but there are a lot of YouTube traders you can check out if seriously interested.",

Now- we are in extreme debt and quickly becoming unsustainable. What happens when it does? WW3. Gold has intrinsic value. it is what it is a fundamental element on the periodic table-nothing more nothing less but what an individual is willing to pay for it. BTC follows these same rules.",

Like the USD and gold even if both are heavily manipulated. So if you're going to assign value to something you have to compare it to a standard. Doesn't make the system any less disgusting, but it is what we have until it is replaced because it collapsed under its own corruption or something better. \n\nI do have a bank account. So I use the corrupt system. Does that make me a hypocrite ? No it makes me someone with very limited options. Doesn't mean I don't understand how abusive that system is. ",
