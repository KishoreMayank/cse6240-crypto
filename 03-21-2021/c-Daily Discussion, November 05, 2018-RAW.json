I'm not mining anything.\n\nWhy? Because it really doesn't explain why all of a sudden I'd have to be melting my computer running wtf computation calculations to generate numbers out of it's own arse for these things I'm supposed to be generating.\n\nNow, 1 bitcoin is approximately AUS$8850. If I only need AUS$80 worth of bitcoin, how is this broken down? I'd rather buy the bitcoin outright then nuke my computer, which I can do, apparently. If I do am I buying a percentage of a bitcoin? As there are no cents separating the distinction between what a positive amount of bitcoin is called compared to less than a positive bitcoin amount I would be buying, do I literally just provide the figure amount I see, even though it would be an extremely small number?\n\nAs I said, I don't want to mine. I don't have the hardware, lifestyle, or shits to give, someone wants to deal in cryptocurrency so I'm doing my bit to be informed so I know enough to make this painless. Wallets can go mobile for under $1000 so it should be possible yeah? If this stuff is traded how can I be sure that $80 in cash will stay as equivalent $80 in bitcoin? I don't want someone screaming down my neck after payment saying I ripped them off, never wanting to do business with me again. Thank you.",

So, I would say to people: please give me your money, so I can do something useful with it, you're going to lose it anyway by investing it when price goes up or drops, instead of now. You're going to lose all your money, cause you're looking at your imaginary neighbour and say to yourself: i'm going to do something when he does something. Then, it's already too fcking late. Smart hawkish investors are laughing at you, all of you. They pulled their money out in december and went back in in september/october. Some are still waiting a little bit more before stepping back in.  They know how the game is played. You do the opposite of what 90 percent of people do, and you win.",

It's a \"is a marketable security that tracks a stock index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets\".\n\nBut Bitcoin is only one thing.  I would understand a Crypto ETF, where it is a fund of all different cryptos so that it diversifies your investment.

            "Text": "Why would institutional money artificially prop up the price before initiating a bullrun/FOMO? Institutions would be happy to short it down and accumulate at a lower price point before pumping it up; it would seem counter-intuitive to burn money to keep the price artificially high; except if the goal was to harm Bitcoin. If I were an institution that wanted exposure I'd have invested into mining during most of 2018 while simultaneously shorting BTC. Then when my fiat stack is big and my hashrate share is relatively high; and the BTC price the lowest I can sustainably short it; then pump it to the moon. But then again; I'm not at the helm of these institutions making decisions so what do I know.",

'It's going to stabilize around 6200'. Price can only fall to 5000 in the course of months. It's almost mathematically impossible to fall to 5000 in 1,2 or even 3 weeks when you're dealing with a flat or almost flat line. My predictions of btc are on spot since january. Everyone thought the bullmarket would continue in 2018. I said: 'no, price follows interest. Interest is gone. It's over for this year'. This is the .com bubble for crypto. How do I know? You need to follow the interest. For the first time in 10 years, search results of Bitcoin dropped. That's a huge indicator. It means we dealt with the .com bubble for crypto, and the hypermania is gone. This hypermania will never come back, like the .com mania never came back. Of course, everyone was angry. I'm predicting this shit the way it should be predicted. It's going to take 3 to 6 years before btc reaches ath again. This is what's going to happen. Of course, this post will lead to anger and agressive talk. ",

            "Text": "Firstly, external macro economic factors: banking crisis of 2018 lead to blockchain and btc. It also lead to innovation in many countries and governments to cut costs and make profits. There will be a moment this economic growth reaches it's top and it's already slowing down. The next crisis could lead to new ways for governments and companies to implement cost effective methods. Blockchain is the solution. Blockchain makes the whole economic system and governmental system way more effective. So, it's about adoption now. With gradual adoption of blockchain, crypto will become more popular and mainstream. This will take some time. There could also be a currency problem like in Turkey (unlikely to happen in western countries) or an inflation problem (which already is happening in western countries, prices are going up). That's another reason to invest in crypto, cause investors always look for ways to maximize their gains (they had no big reasons to invest in cryoto with stocks reaching ath this year). The mass also looks for ways to secure its wealth.\n\nSecondly, you deal with the psychology of the market. Don't underestimate the crash in january. It scared the hell out of people, especially average joe. It takes time before people get adjusted to the idea that Bitcoin and crypto are here to stay and are not going away. The last bearrun took 1.5 year. This crash was bigger, involving more people. It needs more time to recover.  You look at past marketpatterns, you see a huge crash in the first few weeks, then more dropping, and then a long sideway movement with low volume and low volatiliy. This is the period to invest for smart investors. \n\nSo now the .com bubble for crypto has happened (once the mass touches an asset, the bubble bursts). Average joe = 'quickly in, quickly out an never return'. That's the reason why for example Microsoft needed 16 years to go back to Ath. The stock was touched by average joe, and new money didn't came in for years. Same situation with btc. Every nerd and cryptofanatic is already involved. It's going to take years before slowly attracting new investors and new money. \n\nThere are other factors. Institutional money will not come in. I already said that in february here and everyone was angry and said institutional money will come 100% in 2018, and i was banned for saying the opposite. Institutions are NOT interested in highly volatility markets. They are looking for long term gains (10-20-30 years) with reasonable growth and medium risks. They are not interested in quick gains. They don't care if btc could reach 12000 next week. Big institutions are gambling with people's money, they will not invest in crypto unless volatility is stable. It's out of the question. \n\nBut i am convinced btc will reach 100.000 within a couple of years, cause society needs blockchain and btc is the symbol of this new system. I'm sure people who invest now will have made x 10 in 3 to 6 years. This is THE period to invest. Volatility is gone, flat Line, volume is low. What do you want more as an investor? What are people waiting for? Ah, of course, they are waiting to invest when price drops or goes up, the most stupid moments to invest. You need to invest when volatility is low, volume is low. \n\nBesides, even in bearmarkets there are ups and downs. You look at the bearmarket of 2013-2015, you'll see some small bullruns. I would say, take advantage of it and be lucky.",
