No chart analysis because I don't believe in giving my gut feelings names according to vague shapes. I save that for watching clouds.\n\nBut why do we need another bull run? Bitcoin has proven its worth to the world and maybe, just maybe, this is and/or was the \"dot com\" crash. Know what happened after the crash? That's when the Internet *actually* blossomed, and changed the world forever.\n\nMoney is just money. I make plenty to live. But you don't often get to watch this kind of innovation take off. Last time we saw something like this was after a wicked crash some 15 years ago. The tech giants of today took a whole decade to return to their ATH valuations. \n\nIf this dude is right and this is it... maybe it's time to focus less on HODL and more on BUIDL.\n\n\n",

Some technologies can go mainstream in 5 to 10 years but not to the extent of replacing a currency system. That will take a very long time. Kids won't be learning to count satoshies instead of dollars for a long time. But Bitcoin and the global framework to support it is advancing quite well. The apps you can access now to purchase and store crypto and way ahead of what was available a few years ago. Advancement is happening, nobody can deny that. As a store of value and investment, we could see mainstream adoption by 2025 easily. Bottom line - buying a Bitcoin now at 5-7k, and owning it in 10 years when it may be worth over 50k is as worthwhile of an investment as anything out there.",
