            "Text": "TL/DR: Ledger didn't send me the number of nano s's I ordered/paid for and now they won't answer me... I don't know what to do next.\n\nI ordered 10 ledgers from their site to give as gifts at Christmas. A package arrived after a few days, but there was only one ledger nano s inside, the box of which had been damaged in the post as it was shipped in a simple one ply bubble wrap envelope with no additional cushioning/protection.\n\nI immediately went on to the ledger official site and used their contact form to provide a photo of the damaged item, the envelope (which never would have fit 10 inside it), and saying I understood they were busy, but there had clearly been a picking error in their warehouse and could they please send more.\n\nI never received a response.\n\nI waited until after new year to try again as I understood they had a huge backlog of orders and loads of tickets open. This time I wrote to the sales@ email address. I did get a response after a day, but they just wrote:\n\n\"With the cryptocurrencies market cap breaking new records, we are facing an incredible surge in the demand for our products. Stocks are therefore depleting much quicker than anticipated. As a consequence, we have to review channel allocations and have no other choice than to suspend bulk orders until further notice. We are taking this opportunity to rebuild our reseller program and we will come back to you in the coming weeks with an onboarding form to better qualify your needs and understand your distribution strategy (please make sure to subscribe to our reseller newsletter here to get notified). Thank you for your understanding and patience. Best regards, The Ledger team\"\n\nObviously the above doesn't make sense in the context of my email.\n\nI understand the pains of growing a new business, and that these things happen, but I'm feeling pretty undervalued as a customer now. I wasn't sure where to go from here, so thought I'd post here and see if anyone from the company could help me.\n\nI posted the above on the ledger subreddit and it was deleted with no explanation. I was also shadowbanned across the whole site (I'm posting from a new log in). I'm hoping it was automod that deleted/shadowbanned it for some reason, and not their mods.\n\nAny ideas what I should do next?\n",

This drives wave after wave of bottom fishing in which speculators buy into an apparent bottom only to be disappointed/ wiped out by a renewal of the downtrend.\n\nAt some point, all the bottom fishers have expended their capital and prices retrace to the pre-bubble levels, or even lower.

I have heard from a few people here and YouTube, discord etc that if that happens it may go down to 10k before heading back up. Is this realistic? I'm New but would welcome the chance to buy some more BTC at 10k as I started when it was worth more and had only gone that low or close to it one time and I was to new to have buy orders set or anything and missed out. My SMART GF did buy a bunch at 10k last dip tho so that's good \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\ude01 but yeah. Does that number 12.8k really mean anything to anyone that reads charts well? Thanks.",

So at the Bitcoin(pre-lightning) speed of 7tx/sec then 269 Tim Hortons can be serviced without building up a backlog of unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain.\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons\n\n\nTotal Locations: 4613\n\n\nCanadian Locations: 3802\n\n\nPopulation of Canada: 36 million\n\n\nPopulation of Earth: 7.442 billion or 7442 million\n\n\nState of Lightning: Unfinished and unreleased\n\n\nHopefulness level on the future of Lightning: I'm holding\n\n\nChapter Two: Bitcoin Cash\n\n\n8mb Blocks Currently: 7tx/sec x 8 = 58tx/sec\n\n\nTim Hortons Served: 58 \u00f7 0.026 = 2521 Tim Hortons drive throughs\n\n\nCanadian Tim Hortons Locations: 3802 .... BCH can serve at present 2521 locations\n\n\nLets ramp it up a bit.... let me assume that everybody loves Tim Hortons as much as Canada.\n\n\nthats 785,957 Tim Hortons locations worldwide if that were true\n\n\n785,957 \u00f7 2521 = 311 8mb blocks or 311 x 8 = 2494mb blocks\n\n\nBCH would require blocks 2494mb in size to serve worldwide Tim Hortons drive throughs assuming that Tim Hortons became as popular worldwide as it is in Canada.\n\n\n2.494Gb blocks\n\n\nhttps://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX68859\n\n\n1Tb harddrive: 1000 \u00f7 2.49 = 401 BCH blocks to fill this hardrive\n\n\nhow many of these harddrives filled in one year? How many blocks are in one year? 1 x 6 x 24 x 365 = 52,560\n\n\n52560 \u00f7 401 = 131 of these harddrives will be filled in one year\n\n\n131 harddrives x $100 each = $13,100 dollars\n\nBCH Level.  Holding\n\n\nEdit: I should say that if maxed out currently BCH would only require 1 of those hard drives per year...I think.",

They would treat it the same as bartering stocks for a car. To calculate, you count it as if you sold the BTC for dollars.\n\nThe only way to change that would be for the IRS to decide to treat BTC as a currency, rather than as a security.",

If the stock market keeps the price of BTC stable we are in trouble. \n\nRoger Ver and his group own 300 - 500 thousand BTC. If coinbase is involved with Rogers evil plan Ver is in control of 500,000+ BTC to manipulate prices. When CME needs BTC they buy direct from Roger at a set price. Hurts BTC while Ver pumps his Btrash. Would anyone put this past Roger Ver, the stock market guys or bankers?\n\nBTC has been flat lining about a week after CME pumped BTC to 20k. If the stock market and bankers didn't get involved in BTC would it be flat lining today? A lot of new people and money coming into the crypto market since Dec 10th. \n\nAgain this is only a theory. What's not a theory is Roger Ver is a greedy and evil man. Roger has gone out of his way to hurt BTC and people that #HODL BTC for self gains. \n",

If you value a Crypto currency like bitcoin higher than your fiat it makes sense from a philosophical point of view to go ahead and start placing some money into it. Think of it as saving for a future bitcoin based purchase instead of having to convert all at once. If you are lucky the bitcoin will eventually value beyond your expectations. If not you still are saving your money in a system free of banks and centralized gov and will one day spend it on something of your choosing.",

That bill doesn't say what you're claiming it says at all -- it simply makes it illegal for a local government to \"impose any tax or fee on the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity.\" We aren't talking about the government imposing a *use* on the blockchain here (that would occur if there was a 5 cent tax on every transaction or something like that). Taxes on gains by the IRS still apply -- the state of Nevada couldn't change that even if they wanted to. \n\nB. Every time you trade an asset for another asset, you have to look at the cost basis of the initial asset. If you buy some gold for $50, and 10 years later use it to buy $200 in widgets, you owe taxes on the $150. The IRS usually requires you to use the FMV in calculating the tax owed on these transactions. Here's a place to start if you're interested -- Publication 551 -- https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551#en_US_201612_publink1000256962. And here's IRS guidance specific to bitcoin -- https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance.

It\u2019s just too easy for a newcomer to make a wallet in the wrong way, get their money stolen, lost or just get frustrated and give up.\n\nThat said, there is big room for some company to sweep in and offer a trustworthy service. The irony is that it may be a big bank, but people would trust them to look after the bitcoin and be responsible for any stolen / lost coin.\n\nI think until that happens, bitcoin will remain where it is in terms of % penetration / number of active users.",

I would highly encourage you to read through how other people have responded to you throughout this thread and others. Trading one cryptocurrency for another is clearly a taxable event. There's really no dispute there -- property to property exchanges are taxable.\n\nPlease stop giving people poor advice. It hurts the community as a whole when people try to skip out on taxes -- especially when your couch your analysis by repeatedly referencing state laws that are entirely immaterial to the issue at hand. Bad advice causes real problems\n\n",
