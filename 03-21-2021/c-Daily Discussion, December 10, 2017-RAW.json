Can you imagine the margin you will need and what the daily limits will do to you if you are wrong? Go and read about what daily limits did to Ray Dalio in the pork belly markets in the 70s. Hint: he got spit roasted\n- it\u2019s the motherfuxkinf year end. Funds want to lock in their returns for the year. Why would they risk their 5-8% return for the year to short bitcoin then show investors their performance for the full year is shit? It\u2019s mid December. Fund managers are looking to go to lap dance land and take their mind off the market, not do their riskiest trade of the year\n\n2) there isn\u2019t a twi. Just buy it the mofo",

            "Text": "I had been thinking ever since the futures were announced that they would be bad for Bitcoin and allow people with deep pockets to short and drive down the price, but as soon as I read that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Citigroup were lobbying to try to get the futures trading suspended, I started to rethink my stance a little bit. \n\nIt is certainly possible they are bluffing, but I have to believe that anything the big banks don't want to happen is probably a good thing for Bitcoin. There has also been a **LOT** of FUD in the mainstream media over the last few days like https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2017/12/09/seven-lies-bitcoin-fans-tell-themselves-and-anyone-else-who-will-listen/ and also people spreading lies or outright false information like Jim Cramer: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/cramer-bitcoin-is-suspicious-for-5-reasons.html. \n\nI know it's impossible to know what is going to happen in the future when the futures market opens, but I am starting to think it may end up being a big non-event. The fact that everyone now is uncertain and thinks the price will crash makes me wonder if the market will do the exact opposite.",

            "Text": "Hello beginners. Here is a quick experience from someone who\u2019s not rich but spend some time in this market to give some basic advice. \n\nI follow cryptocurrencies since 2014 and started to invest in May 2017, when bitcoin was around 2K (but i went for ETH by that time)\n\nI lost \u00a31.5K (30% of my investment) in 6 months trading in ETH, Bcash, XMR and Bitcoin, buying from the peak and selling at the dip with panic every single time. In the last 2 weeks, i doubled my investment, told my self to calm the f down and hold, and i made \u00a33K profit. I didnt feel stupid or bankrupt when i was losing, and i\u2019m not feeling rich or genius because I made 3K in a week.\n\nThere is one simple reason: I didn\u2019t invest more than i could afford. If futures or something else takes bitcoin below 10K and will never recover in two years, i will say \u201cat least i tried\u201d. The amount i may lose wont make me poor or affect my life standards. However, if it\u2019ll reach 30-50K, i\u2019ll make more than i saved in the last three years.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a beginner, just put what you can afford and hold until you reach your goal: paying your student loan, credit card debt, mortgage, buying a house or retiring. There are no investment accounts out there that can make you that much money.\n\nBut if you\u2019ve already made over 100K profit like most of my friends did, you should be stupid to take the risk in times like this that can potentially take half of your profit you made in years. (Edit: unless you turned your profit into something that you can enjoy everyday)",

I am hoping that 3-4 years from now I can sell my investment at 500k$ per coin and buy a house.\nHow much of your salary or savings do you invest in BTC or alt coins each month?

Now it seems that in coinbase you cant ask to specifically sell the bitcoins you bought about a month ago for 300$ (lets say you want to hold on to the ones you bought for 200$). Does bitcoin not differentiate between your different bitcoins that you've bought and just sell however many you ask it to sell? Because that's what i seems like.",

I'm in Canada, is there a trusted site I should use to trade? I'm currently on CoinBase right now but I can't withdraw from them directly. I also just downloaded the Exodus wallet (is it good?), should I be transferring all my money to the wallet? I have them sitting in CoinBase's \"wallet\" but idk if I should take it all out and put it in a wallet or put a little in the wallet and leave a little in CoinBase? I think on Exodus I can buy and trade directly in the program but I'm not sure.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

It's actually for trading so I can set the prices.\n\nShould I set up a cold storage and transfer purchases there?(It's a small amount.)\n\nIt probably is the lowest/best price.\n\nP.S.

Futures are a precursor to other investment products like ETFS-which would blow bitcoin out of the water (upward In price)...the reason why futures are a precursor is because they have a way of determining the true price of the underlying asset and decreasing volatility (after a while).....stocks, cotton, and oil are good examples.  \n\nEdit: yes, futures are settled in cash.

Bitcoin right now isn't competitive compared to the dollar etc because the transactions are slow and expensive.\n\nThis is being solved by some very very smart developers which are creating an off-chain solution (which basically means that it will be possible to do transactions without publishing them to the Blockchain right away). This will allow for extremely fast and cheap transactions, while being very secure and resistant to fraud.\n\nlightning.network (website) will offer some more info, although it is a bit technical.\n\nFor now, look at Bitcoins issues as a good thing. It's a great time to invest because right now it isn't where it needs to be, and thus it's price is \"cheap\". - As \"2nd-layer/off-chain\" solutions are implemented and made available, Bitcoins usability WILL improve and thus prices will go up.\n\nI'd be willing to bet that Steam reintroduces Bitcoin as a means of payment pretty quickly following the implementation and deployment of Lightning Network.\n",

            "Text": "Litecoin is fairly similar to Bitcoin.  It has the lightning network implemented, but also has a significantly lower network effect, and thus lower value than Bitcoin.  (There are people who would staunchly disagree with me and advocate for it though, recommend reading their subreddit to get a sense of what those arguments might be.)\n\nEthereum is very different from both BTC and LTC.  Ethereum is not trying to be the ultimate store of value like BTC.\n\nEthereum is different than Bitcoin in that it allows for smart contracts which can be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met. For example an individual wants to purchase a home from another person. Traditionally there are multiple third parties involved in the exchange including lawyers and escrow agents which makes the process unnecessarily slow and expensive. With Ethereum, a piece of code could automatically transfer the home ownership to the buyer and the funds to the seller after a deal is agreed upon without needing a third party to execute on their behalf.\n\nThere are many people who are incredibly bullish on the platform potential of ETH.  There are a number of applications that currently act as a third party to connect you with others based on some set logic (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, eBay). Many of the centralized systems we use today could be built in a decentralized manner on Ethereum.",

The seller now owes you $4k to make up for that \"loss\" on your end.\n\nIf the price plummets you now owe the seller whatever the different between the current price and the contract price since you \"promised\" to buy at the contract price. E.g - Contract was at $16k but BTC dropped to $10k. You now owe the seller $6k.\n\nAs for how the market behaves? Not really sure. I guess it's based on what the current price is doing and what the investors believe will happen. i.e - Super simplified: If the market tanks to $10 per BTC the futures probably will probably drop too since it's unlikely to make a $16k gain in one month.",

So someone buying a a bitcoin future will agree to pay that price once the future expiry date takes place, i.e. 17th of January.

Better to watch how things to and do it in pieces rather than all at once.\n\nIt hit 19k last week. Maybe it'll go well over 20k this week and you might have the opportunity to make way more selling that coin, if you're determined to sell it. Frankly, I think this is a terrible time to sell.

Anyone who thinks Bitcoin is immune to intervention is naive and will be massively disappointed. \nWith futures trading and a likely ETF at some point, there will have to be some semblance of stability. \nGiven the helpless folks sending tweets to Coinbase about how they can\u2019t get access to their purchased Bitcoin I sense a massive clusterfuck is forthcoming. \nAll of the above OR everyone wakes up one day and all their Bitcoin has been stolen. Remember, the folks jumping in now, like in the dot com bubble, aren\u2019t savvy and have no idea how to use other secure storage systems.

'Bit off topic, but I'm honestly surprised (and relieved of course) that no one has staged an armed assault on Coinbase or the like. If you look up \"biggest bank heists\", they were in the millions... with crypto, we're talking billions! And you can take them all with you on the plane to your tropical paradise.\n\nSecond biggest threat would be a major government move against it. Not China half-assedly putting their hands in, but the EU or US completely banning it, putting in network blocks and prosecuting offenders.\n\nIn contrast, a bubble burst would probably not kill it. Much like the houses and mortgage markets are still around.",

Although that might make it take longer. Down below you said you helped your hairdresser \"set up a blockchain\". I don't mean to be mean or anything, but it sounds like you don't know very much about this technology. If you are seriously complaining, then you need to do research to understand the current state of the technology. If you just thought it was funny, then I apologize for being somewhat rude in my response. \n\nMy point is that yes there are problems right now, but this isn't how Bitcoin is supposed to function. I just don't want you to discourage others from using it. Bitcoin currently isn't functional enough to be a currency. Think of it more as digital gold. It is deflationary and a store of wealth. After they finish the lightning network, it will be able to handle all this demand and it will be able to function as a currency as well. ",

They are swamped in applications.\n\n-Coinsquare : has balls high fees and poor customer service but you will get verified quite fast. They also have an app that is pretty swell but man... the fees. \n\n-Einstein : it's a startup, a new Vancouver based platform.

What kind of regurgitated BS is this? At this stage there are even more decentralized projects than bitcoin. Bitcoin has serious political issues that have led to consolidated power. Me thinks you haven\u2019t don\u2019t much research... ",

For a lunar elevator, the cable or tether extends considerably farther out from the lunar surface into space than one that would be used in an Earth-based system. However, the main function of a space elevator system is the same in either case; both allow for a reusable, controlled means of transporting payloads of cargo, or possibly people, between a base station at the bottom of a gravity well and a docking port in outer space.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

That may or may not be the actual price next Wednesday - its a bet.\n\nThis Futures Contract has no effect (except psychological) on the price of BTC tonight or at any time through next Wednesday - and beyond for that matter. The price of a Bitcoin will be what it actually is on the various exchanges (CB, GDAX...). The Futures Market are dependent on our markets - not the other way round as long as we don't let it get in our heads. HODL.\n\nhttp://cfe.cboe.com/products/bitcoin-qrg.pdf",

            "Text": "Derivative contracts based on an underlying asset (in this case, bitcoin).\n\nThink of bitcoin as a horse race. You can buy a horse and race it around the track right now, and that's about it. Futures allow spectators to now place bets between themselves on what horse is going to win, without having to own a horse themselves.\n\nThis means that some of the institutions who currently hold a ton of bitcoin can place a side bet on the futures market that bitcoin will be, say under $800 in 20 days. Then, in the actual bitcoin market they sell off all their bitcoins and cause the market to crater. This is market manipulation in almost every instance, but since bitcoin is proudly unregulated, there's no ability to stop this behavior.\n\nThe futures markets do not crash at all if bitcoin crashes, since they are just spectators. All open positions are countered by the opposite bet, and closed on expiration (or if you sell your own side of the contract, but don't worry about that).\n\nI'd suggest you read up a bit on finance - it's about to become important to bitcoin.",

            "Text": "**Triangular arbitrage**\n\nTriangular arbitrage (also referred to as cross currency arbitrage or three-point arbitrage) is the act of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity resulting from a pricing discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign exchange market. A triangular arbitrage strategy involves three trades, exchanging the initial currency for a second, the second currency for a third, and the third currency for the initial. During the second trade, the arbitrageur locks in a zero-risk profit from the discrepancy that exists when the market cross exchange rate is not aligned with the implicit cross exchange rate. A profitable trade is only possible if there exist market imperfections.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Grain, precious metals, electricity, oil, beef, orange juice,and natural gas are traditional examples of commodities, but foreign currencies, emissions credits, bandwidth and certain financial instruments are also part of today's commodity markets.\n\nThere are two kinds of participants in futures markets: hedgers and speculators. Hedgers do not usually seek a profit by trading commodities futures but rather seek to stabilize the revenues or costs of their business operations. Speculators are usually not interested in taking possession of the underlying assets. They essentially place bets on the future prices of certain commodities. Speculators are often blamed for big price swings in the futures markets, but they also provide a lot of liquidity to the futures markets.\n\nSource: http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/options-derivatives/futures-market-4895",

The Chicago Board of Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange are offering these contracts on their markets. \n\nSo now someone can buy a futures contract for bitcoin that comes due on Jan 10th 2018, Feb 10th 2018, and Mar 10th 2018. \n\nIf you have bitcoins and you think the price is going to go down then you can agree to sell someone bitcoins Jan 10th at $15,500 and someone can buy a futures contract that would enable them to buy them. Now if the price goes down you still get to sell them for $15,500 when that contract comes due. \n\nIf the price goes up then you have to provide the bitcoins at $15,500 and the other person can sell them for whatever the new higher price is.\n\nThe CBOE/CME have set these futures as cash-settled however so all exchanges are done in cash on the market and not in bitcoins. So instead of providing the bitcoins you would provide the cash value of the bitcoins. \n\nThis is key because it allows someone to invest in the market without owning the actual asset. Same way you and me can trade in hogs and wheat without owning a farm.",

Unlike when I started, without a degree you won't even be considered, unfortunately.  If you could get your foot in the door- even if it was some menial position you could get an idea of the workplace dynamics and sometimes you'll get someone to take you under their wing if you express enough interest.  M & A is super hot right now, but when the credit cycle turns (my guess is around 2019) it will be slow for a while- until prices have declined enough for the sharks to come out.  HFT isn't going anywhere unless they cause some massive liquidity event (i.e. there isn't any) and the government decides to mandate speed bumps and the like.  \nFeel free to ask other questions or DM me.",

            "Text": "FUD = fear uncertainty and doubt\n\nSo for example, recently a bunch of people that knew nothing about Futures were spreading around a lot of nonsense to scare people. They use a large number of accounts to make it seem like a large group of people all believe this.  I hesitate to mention their other key topics for various reasons, but they all rely on the same tactic:  they target the new Bitcoiner that does not yet understand it technically enough to separate the fact from the fiction.\n\nSo for example, they might send a really large number of transactions just over the dust limit with a small transaction fee to make it seem like a lot of users can't use Bitcoin (especially if they intend to mine their own transactoins).  Then they start making A LOT of posts about it with again, a large number of accounts.  They will use old accounts to try to convince people that \"old Bitcoiners\" are giving up.\n\nThat is why the best tool we have is to encourage everyone to understand Bitcoin fully and as completely as possible.  The better you understand Bitcoin, the better you can identify fact from fiction, and the better you can make your own decisions.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt",

If you're going to to put a little money on cryptos other than BTC, I'd just pick the 3 or 4 most traded and put even money on each of them. Some of them might go to zero but if one goes up 1000% or more, you make money. With an upside like that, you only need to be right once... like investing in BTC in 2010 or 2011.

At its peak,  Congress passed a law changing the way leverage was allowed,  they got margin called,  and those contracts had to be sold at market. \n\nI'm not saying you're wrong,  the same situation might be about to happen.

Then I realized I had to pay 7.90\u20ac in fees for a 50\u20ac transfer. This is crazy despote choosing \"slow transfer\".\n\nIn the pizzeria then me and the waiter were not sure how we are going to implement the fees into the payment. Both having xapo. There was no way knowing before paying how high the fees would be and we didnt find an option inside xapo to see which fees option (fast or slow) could be changed to avoid fees. The others on my table were discourage to dee how long it takes and the uncertainty involed in doing a bitcoin payment. Me and the waiter decided to roughly guess the fees and split them. Instead of 21.30\u20ac I send 19\u20ac. It was quite a inconveniant process and until today I still dont know whether me or the waiter ended up with the fees and how much it was.\n\nI'm not a Bcash guy and I know/hope these issues wil be solved in the next year but these are serious problems for a currency.",

High transaction fees have already been addressed via segwit and will continue to be addressed down to nothing over lighting network when it goes live. The other word for community infighting is called democracy. The forks are just like altcoins that use bitcoin as their premine, plus they represent a nice dividend for bitcoin holders. I made 60k off forks this year, which I reinvested into bitcoin which is another reason to hodl bitcoin. Consolidation of power by whom? Core. That\u2019s a joke. Core is a loose gathering of smart people who get together on their own volition to work on bitcoins code. So far away from its original vision it\u2019s scary? I think if you look at the technical underpinnings of bitcoin. You\u2019ll see that we are right on track with satoshis vision. The people who get confused by this are the people who only read the white papers title \u201ca peer to peer electronic cash system\u201d. We\u2019re not a peer to peer electronic cash system yet, that\u2019s true. However we will be, it\u2019s just going to happen on second layer.",

            "Text": "No it isn't, it's called normal people getting involved with crypto. They see $$$ and they want in. Do you think the average person knows what \"fiat\" means, or what fractional reserve banking is? No. They don't give a shit. They go to the store, they take out their credit card, they swipe, and viola - they bought something. Since you can't really do that (considering the extra hassle, nor would most people *want* to), the only reason the average person is going to buy cryptocurrency is because of price appreciation. \n\nBitcoin was here first: it has the brand power, it has the awareness, and it has the price appreciation. I can tell you first hand that nobody really gives a shit about any other crypto. They don't care what they do, they don't care what capabilities they add, they *don't care*. That's why Bcash users are sitting around with their thumbs up their asses all day while Bitcoin leaves them in the dust. Once lightning transactions are a thing ([within one or two years](https://www.coindesk.com/lightning-bitcoin-scaling-tech-really-know/)) there won't be a fee or mempool problem anyway. Normal people can barely figure out what Bitcoin is, much less what IOTA or Tether is. You can be idealistic all you want, but if you want widespread crypto adoption, this is what it looks like - and (barring some catastrophe) it's going to be Bitcoin.",

This one is pretty good.  \n\nI bought btc a while back and forgot about it.  I wasn't an expert then FOR SURE.  Excuse me for geeking out on it every day since bought it.  But I have a ton of experience in currency trading.  Whether you like it or not this is a currency.  And it behaves in a lot of ways like a currency of a small emerging country.  The big difference is that it is operating at a global scale.  \n\nSo not knowing about the intricacies of hardware wallets or the best way to convert coins doesn't invalidate my opinion.  \n\nMy model has now shifted the drop from 13 to 14.    It may change again.  This is based on a AI model that I have used on currencies and it is now learning how to function with BTC.   I am making money trading.  Its working for me.  I simply publish when I get bigger indications in an attempt be helpful.  And if you are curious the timeframe is usually within the next 6 to 12 hours.  If you want to know what is going to happen at 2:27 PM ET then sorry I cant help.  \n\nIs it possible that it will be completely wrong?  YEP!  It can be wrong and will be wrong.  For sure.   Is it still a useful tool and is it getting better with time?  Absolutely.  \n\nPhilosophically the long term with BTC is sound.  It will go much higher.  This is something I \"believe\" - not something that a model is showing me.  The short term is absolutely not sound and I cannot see this kind of volatility and not try and make more money on it.  \n\nNow as to this local prediction - there is still a some pending lack of support.  So I expect a drop.  I may hit 15 or just under.  If the model is working well then it will go to 14.   if shits on fire it may go to 13 though based the prediction trend I dont see that happening.  I see interesting stuff happening on monday as well but the confidence in those prediction is very low at the moment.  \n\nDo with this as you please.  ",

To assume Bitcoin will stay on top strictly due to first mover advantage is hubris at its finest and the exact reason it could fail. It\u2019s a story as old as time and if you don\u2019t think so you are being incredibly naive. \n\nEDIT: Also no one gives a shit about other cryptocurrencies? Is this a joke? There are more devs working on ethereum and ethereum based projects than all other blockchains combined. Ethereum has numerous large companies and governments in its alliance. Coinbase\u2019s (the gateway of crypto) CEO is far more bullish on Ethereum and is building a dApp store. On top of all this Ethereum will soon be Proof of Stake which will pay out dividends just to hold. Investors love dividends.\n\nI am not trying to shill ethereum over bitcoin. I am making a point that many many people care about it (and other blockchains) and if Bitcoin doesn\u2019t get its shit together it can easily be taken over in size and scope. \n\n",
