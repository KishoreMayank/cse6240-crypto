Is a lighting transaction significantly lower than that? \n\nExample: Do I need 1 minimum bitcoin transaction per party I want to transact with? Say I want to use btc to pay for coffee and then the bus, I use lightning, does this lead to 2 separate btc transactions anyways? Or am I missing something? ",

            "Text": "I wouldn't look at it this way. There's no correlation with hash power to transaction throughput on the base chain.  A single miner (a 5W raspberry pi for example) is all that's needed for the network to run.  Any additional mining acts to secure the network and come to consensus, but how much computing power is contributed to that has no impact on the number of transactions which can take place.\n\nWe really want lots of hashpower to keep the network in consensus, otherwise anyone can double spend or do a deep block reorg and then there would be no point to using bitcoin.  Now I can understand, given environmental concerns, debating the sources of our electricity, but that's a different discussion. \n\nIf you want to think about the logistics of lighting network, think about how you interact with the internet.  Do you run one fiber optic cable to wikipedia, since you use them sometimes, and another cable to reddit?  No, you just need a minimum of one connection - to your ISP - and because it's connected to many other nodes, it can route your traffic wherever it needs to go.  Same with LN, and in relation to power, it's all off-chain, so it's only how much power your cell phone, casa node, or computer is consuming.\n\nHope that helps.",

            "Text": "Transactions don't require a significant amount of energy (in LN or main chain BTC). Finding blocks requires energy. Thus, 450 kWh/transaction is an extremely misleading metric.\n\nSince LN transactions happen off-chain then more transactions can be processed every minute or hour, compared to on-chain transactions. So in that sense they are more efficient energy-wise. But it's not very relevant to compare energy cost per transaction since the transactions themselves aren't energy-intensive.",

There was no way in hell it was ever going to rebound in the aftermath of Mt Gox. Trolls had a field day with us 'bitcoin extremists' which was a ridiculous way to view people who invested in something they felt had a strong future. But the general public view was to stay away from bitcoin, that it was a fad, a scam, a poison, etc. Then a few years later boom... people don't stay away, they jump back in the game because they realized this was here to stay. In my opinion, if Bitcoin survived that period then the ICO bubble and bear market we're in now is a joke.",

            "Text": "There are better explanations, but the simple answer is that each LN node needs at least one channel (preferably 3+) open with another node.  That channel is created with an on-chain, 2 of 2 signature transaction.  This means both you and the other party have to sign in order to move funds from that transaction's UTXO.  So long as you both want to be on the LN, and both your nodes are active and have a balance, there's no need to close the channel though.\n\nWhile you're operating, each time you or the other node move funds through your channel, you sign a transaction reflecting the updated balance between you and the other node. This might happen hundreds or thousands of times while the channel is active.  This signed transaction is only ever broadcast (to be recorded on chain) when one of you is ready to close the channel.\n\nIn short, you need at least one on chain transaction to get started, and another when you want to close out your channel or node.  In the mean time, there are no restrictions or power requirements to make as many LN transactions as you wish.",

And regardless of whether 1M transactions are made via LN or zero are made via LN, the cost to mine the main-chain block will be the same.\n\nThe energy cost is for securing the network as a whole, not related to the transactions themselves (in any meaningful way).\n\nTBF the number of transactions that can fit inside each block on the main chain are limited. The benefit of LN is that the number of transactions that can be made via LN are NOT directly constrained by the block size since LN transactions occur off-chain.",

Perspective is based on experience and knowledge, while narrative is based on the context of communication. If you sold your bitcoin at a loss and someone else sold at 20k for a huge gain, then that would create two very different perspectives, just as an example. These things are not personal or any reason to personally attack anyone in this sub. You either support something or you don't. What really matters is that you look at all the information and accept that individuals will have differing perspectives. It's the reason for bear versus bull, religion versus non-religion, one political party versus another, etc. There is not always a defined right or wrong side to every scenario.",

Bottom line, when we hit 2 and 3k k again in 2017, that was already massive success. That 20k spike was an anomaly build from hype and ICOs, but now we're back on track and I'd be shocked if this thing doesn't continue to build momentum just as it has been for a decade. ",

You mentioned the anomaly build from hype and  ICOs, do you think that phase plus the FOMO it brought is behind us for good?\n\nDo you think in order for the crypto market to rise again to new heights, there needs to be a prolonged bear market so that the 2018 losses retail investor endured become a distant memory in their minds?",

            "Text": "I wish I knew, but hype and FOMO can be driven by so many unpredictable scenarios it's impossible to predict. I'd guess that there will be many other driving scenarios such as institutional investment via Fidelity/bakkt, security tokens, new developments in the tech, etc. \n\nA prolonged bear market certainly allows time for old wounds to heal, but the retail investment losses make up only a tiny fraction of potential investors. As on ramps to the crypto space become more user friendly and secure, the space may open up to a whole new group of investors. There's also the fact that while much focus has been on the losses, there were also a lot of gains. The drop from 20k to 3k means a lot of folks sold, so not everyone had a bad experience. The bad experiences just  get the loudest voice.",
