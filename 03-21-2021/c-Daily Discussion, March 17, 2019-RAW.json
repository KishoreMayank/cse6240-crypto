            "Text": "Okay so super weird question here... Here goes. I'm pretty much a bitcoin newb. My sibling is VERY into bitcoin so I know the jist of it and how it works. But onto my weird question... I basically got offered by a sugar daddy type person to do his bitcoin deposits for him at a bitcoin ATM and he'd pay me an allowance each time I do it. And it's a good amount of money he's offering.\n\nBut obviously I have some reservations. I asked him why he doesn't do it himself (since that set off a red flag) and he said he could but he wants to help people out who might need money (like me if I do it for him). But other than that it sounds kinda sketchy and this is where my question lies... I know bitcoin is a VERY safe way of exchanging money since your wallet identity is public when you trade, but is this sketchy at all? Could I get in trouble in any way by doing this for him? All he says I need to do is go to a bitcoin ATM, deposit the money into the wallet he provides and that's it. And i'm down to do it for him, but i'm a little worried maybe he wants the money put towards something illegal or nefarious and i'd get caught as the one putting the money in since i'd be the one caught on camera... Idk, maybe i'm just being too careful haha, but do let me know.\n\nSorry for this weird question :P\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses! Needless to say, i'll be blocking this guy and NOT engaging in this lol. ",

            "Text": ">  The thousand would have been in my debit account initially. \n\nThe problem is that the money will appear in your debit account long before the cheque has actually cleared.\n\nIt's a service banks offer called \"cheque negotiation\" (as opposed to \"collection\") - they just credit your account assuming that the cheque will clear and charge you back later if it bounces (which for international transfers can take weeks or months to determine).\n\nMany scams work this way - they send you a bad cheque, you deposit it, see money (+$1,000) in your account and think everything is fine, you then transfer some money irreversibly \"back\" to the scammer (-$800), your bank notifies you that the cheque you have deposited bounced and reverses crediting your account (-$1,000), you paid whatever you sent the scammer out of your own pocket (now you're $800 poorer and will probably blame your bank for letting you do this).\n",
