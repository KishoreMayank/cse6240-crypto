I think the prevailing sentiment on this sub is just wrong right now - this is a classic *buying opportunity*.\n\nUnless you think BlockChain technology (more accurately **Distributed Ledger Technology**) is garbage; and that ~10 years of *Bitcoin et al.* development and advancement is an illusion (a pretty long bubble don\u2019t ya think); and that all the banks, tech companies, hedge funds and many industries and corporations currently using and / or planning to use and invest billions into DLT are lying to the press and their shareholders - then you should be buying some stakes in this now.\n\nNo one knows who will be the big (medium or small) *winners* in BC - just like they didn\u2019t know the winners when the Net exploded in the late 1990s - but they will emerge and grow.\n\nIMO, you should be doing (as I am) what every venture capitalist has been doing for over 20 years - space out your bets (weighted, if you have strong feelings) on the most promising 10 or so *blockchain start-ups* i.e. - coins - so you have an equity stake in this emerging tech.\n\nSome will fail, a few will establish reasonably profitable enterprises  and perhaps 2 or 3 will skyrocket; the profits from the rockets should  (and historically do) more than cover the losses in the laggards.\n\nAnd we are a million miles from the mergers and acquisitions phase  that occurs in any fast moving tech - big corps let the start ups invent and fight it out and then scoop them up when the dust clears.\n\nThis is an incipient and crucial part any business cycle - creators, disruptors and first movers are shrouded in the fog of this coin frenzy. And right now they are cheap.\n\n**Dips are when you buy.**\n\nBut - *only if you can afford to invest, monitor, adjust and be patient* - and that determination is unique to everyone on the sub.\n\nGood luck.",

In December alone they have gone from a reasonable $5 average, to now, nearly $40.\n\nSource: https://bitcoinfees.info/\n\nI do actually see this as a problem. That is a significant increase happening very quickly, and looking back historically of the charts, it is fastest spike in fees BTC has ever had and the highest fee. Given the trend, it may actually go higher in the coming days. We might actually see a $100 transaction fee average by New Years.\n\n/u/starkbot is going to be on Bloomberg later and I'm hoping she is able to give a realistic timeframe for relief of this. \n\nLooking at the spike on the chart, I am actually a little concerned.\n\nUsual caveats: I strongly dislike bcash, and am hodling BTC. Since I'm hodling, I'm not hugely concerned about the transactions fees, but I am concerned about their impact on the value of BTC (after all, I am a grumpy hodler).",

She called me in a panic because she saw Bitcoin had fallen to $15k in the news and urged me to sell. \u201cSweetie, I heard something is happening with those blocks and bits, please get out now!\u201d She said. \n\nShe\u2019s so cute. I giggled. \n\n\u201cMom, I bought at $1,750, and when Asia wakes up in their morning, they will see that it\u2019s a great time to buy. I\u2019m gonna HODL. If it hits $2k, then I\u2019ll sell so that I walk away with my initial investment and know that it\u2019s been a fun and exciting year.\u201d \n\n",

What is clear so far is that there is a risk in everything that you do, nothing is guaranteed from the start.

I have no fckin idea but I can tell you one thing - i am going to HODL for as long as I fckin can.\nI have friends who are on their way to become bitcoin/crypto millionaires in a few months, based on their initial investment and if all stays on track.\nDid a lot of reading the past month, both good and bad and tried to filter - the only thing that makes sense if you are not day trading is that you MUST HODL and HODL and HODL and when you think it's over just fckin HODL.\n\n Have a look at the overall charts and RELAX, it's almost f Christmas. Spend some good time with your family and friends, dance on the bar and shit but remember to HODL for your phone if your wallet is on it! Talk to you early next year!\n",

What I don't understand from all the panic selling is what are you people thinking?  You should know that cryptocurrencies are volatile.  You should know that you should invest only what you can afford to lose.  If you are selling now because you are worried about the loss, you invested more than you can afford to lose.  \n\nAlso, for people even newer to Bitcoin than me and for those that have held it longer, why would you continue using Coinbase?  It only took me two transactions with them to realize that their company is a POS.  I've been using Gemini since and am reasonably happy with them.\n\nStop screaming it's the end of the world when the price goes back to what it was a month ago.  Zoom out on the price chart.  You either believe in the technology or you don't.  Stop reacting and start thinking.  If you're speculating and moving in and out, you will lose over the long run.  How many successful day traders do you know?  I'm not saying to cultishly believe in Bitcoin.  If you are convinced there are better options for your money, then please explore them.",

There is no way to prove that that happened directly, but I do think it's interesting that every day since the futures launch has been in the red.  I'm well aware of \"buy the rumor, sell the news\", but the pump leading up to it was crazy. \n\nAnyway what I am wondering is if people think this drop is \n\n1. A normal, healthy correction \n2. The \"bubble\" bursting and we are not going to stop falling\n3. Futures markets manipulating the price for their own benefit\n4. Market worry due to Coinbase insider trading speculation \n5. Roger Ver and Bcash attacks creating FUD and also attacking the network and issuing large market sells to try to crash Bitcoin\n\nOr perhaps it is a combination of all five",

I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the dip tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is Bitcoin going down? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I wanted Bitcoin to be our new currency and replace the corrupt central banking cartel. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this. This is so fucked.",

I've done my share of bagholding but patience is your best friend.\n\nEverything I have diversified is now house money, so if everything comes crashing, oh well...it was a good run.\n\nBut I don't think it will. This space is still young and the various techs are here to stay, so if you can't stomach these big swings (small one right now ATM), for your own sanity and your health, I encourage to take your investment and go. When you do your taxes, just swoop up some savings bonds as these are as safe as you can get when investing.\n\n-I got in last year when BTC was 800 and rode that to space. Thanks to that investment, it allowed me to diversify into other alts. I won big and loss big, but never did I ever put more than I care to lose ( I know, I know that's a trite statement)\n\nAnyway, live long and prosper!",

            "Text": "The bitcoin blockchain is not designed to support point-of-sale, street-retail transactions like buying a beer or groceries. I know that's what the Bitcoin WP talked about \"electronic cash\", but that's not actually what was built or how it is actually used. Personally I'm fine with that, because I think cash is a tiny, and well-served, part of the global economy and I think Bitcoin solves a far more (economically, morally) important set of problems related to global finance and wealth management.\n\nI've only been studying this technology for 3 weeks, but the reasons Bitcoin is not suitable for \"electronic cash\" seem pretty clear to me. That said, please, PLEASE, correct me if I am mistaken:\n\n- Blocks containing transactions are added to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes, by design. This is deterministic, and the difficulty of the hash for a block is raised or lowered based on how quickly the preceding block was mined. That means for an on-chain transaction, you should always expect it to take 10 minutes to confirm.\n- Increasing the size of blocks doesn't shorten transaction confirmation times: they stay at 10 minutes. Larger blocks can contain more transactions, however, so more of them can fit into a 10-minute window, increasing overall transaction processing throughput and potentially lowering the cost of a given transaction (until the volume is high enough to bid up the transactions in a block).\n- As an example, BCH transaction costs are low now because the blocks are larger and volume is low, therefore the fees have not been bid up yet. If it were to become more widely used, the fees would be bid up to the level that the market will bear, which is where they are now for BTC. The difference is that the intent of BCH is to facilitate small \"electronic cash\" transactions, which are less tolerant of higher fees than BTC merely because BTC is primarily being used for large transactions. For example, a $100 fee for a $100,000 BTC transaction is 0.1%. For a 2$ transaction, an equivalent fee would be $.002. Median fees on the BCH blockchain are an order of magnitude greater than this already, even though the blocks do not handle an order of magnitude more transactions.\n\nThe disadvantage of larger blocks is centralization of resources and control within the Bitcoin network: larger blocks require more memory and compute power to mine and better networks to handle the transmission of data (double the size of blocks and, naively, you would imagine that network load is also doubled). This means that older, cheaper mining gear becomes either unusable or significantly less profitable than newer gear, and the ability to mine from an idle PC or a poor quality home network is greatly diminished. Larger blocks, therefore, inherently favor corporate or state actors. This isn't an all-or-nothing, but it's a strong bias against true decentralization of control.\n\nWhat do I have wrong? What am I missing?",

            "Text": "Guys, I gotta be honest. I bought in around the 16-17k mark for bitcoin. Same thing for the rest of my crypto portfolio. I believed in this technology so much from reading all of y'all's optimism on reddit that I invested everything I had into cryptos. All of my savings, my emergency fund, my kids' college fund, even the majority of my paychecks since November, purposefully going past due on my bills thinking I could pay the late fees and still make a profit next month. \n\nHell, I even sold most of my furniture thinking I could make a profit in a few weeks and buy much nicer furniture.\n\nRight now, I'm basically on the brink of failure in life. I don't know how to explain this to my wife. I don't know how I will explain this to my kids when they are older. As sad as this sounds, the only out I see for myself is jumping off of the tallest building in my city. Please convince me that bitcoin's price will rise. My kids need a dad, but if bitcoin keeps falling, maybe they don't need a dad who will squander all of their money.\n\nEdit - Honestly, y'alls' comments were sobering and humbling. I spoke with my wife and explained the situation to her. She was obviously pissed. We have decided to cash out all of our crypto holdings in the morning and try to salvage what we can. I think that is the best decision for our family. Hopefully I can buy back in at some point after tomorrow and ride the wave with you guys once more. Good luck to all of you and may all of you become filthy rich.",

There are sellers all the way from 15000->0. From 0-20000 it is more or less evenly distributed buy/sells. If it can go up 16k it can go down 16k. There is no moon in this game, just hype. You can't spend bitcoin and with this volatility its going to be a long time before it makes sense for average joe to leave his money sitting around in bitcoin.\n\nto short bitcoin you buy dollars.",

In my understanding, a miner with the nonce has to list a block of transactions, and he receives bitcoins in compensation.\n\n\nBut the majority of the community of miners have to agree that the transactions listed by the miner are valid. Why should they do that, what is their reward? What if everyone just says that they are not valid because they want to get the price, or that they are valid just to get to the next block faster?",

I can't help but think a lot of amateur traders went to sleep yesterday forgetting they put it in or haven't realized the magnitude of today's correction.",

            "Text": "Hi guys. I am a noob. I invested some funds in bitcoin on cex.io exchange. I haven't transferred my BTC to a wallet yet.  What do i need to do in order to qualify for SegWit2x hardfork coins? Could you please advise?\n\n\nNow, on December 28, the backward-incompatible SegWit2x hardfork is scheduled to occur. It will result in the formation of an altcoin (S2X or B2X) with 4MB blocks and SegWit support. Interestingly, the developers have said that all BTC balances held at fork time will not only be credited with an equal amount of B2X but also a proportional number of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s coins as a reward.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin (BTC), the hard fork scheduled later this month will result in the creation of 21 million B2X coins. The coin has double spending protection. Recalculation of complexity will be performed after each block. The extraction rate of block is 2.5 minutes. The Bitcoin SegWit2X will also have a unique address format.  ",

T.I.A!\n\nALT's just had a massive PUMP in last 24-48 hours, BTC weak hands are out and SMART money buying the dip, not BTrash (Brash is an ALT not Bitcoin!).. ALT's majority trades are paired with BTC so when the ALT's buying pressure dies off and price retraces, BTC starts rising again and ALT's Stop Loss Orders will get trigger by default putting that money back into BTC further assisting the BTC climb back to the ATH... ALT coin noobs will then FOMO sell ALTS to get in on BTC's new ATH\n\nSupporting this is I believe every BTC holder gets their share of BTX which news will get around on this soon..\n\nOnly a very select few ALT's pump HUGE simultaneously as BTC is on a new ATH breakout, I think EMC2 will be one of them as unlike other ALT's it had a MASSIVE BTC price drop whilst ALT's boomed... it's currently not in the limelight and EMC2 is a GREAT crypto project...\n\nI am in on EMC2 currently, entered on dip. Will sell hopefully for big EMC/BTC gains and by then the value of BTC should be far higher than the present dip whilst most ALT's are bleeding......\n\n- Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.    - You know who",

The spike was to 16k, a lot of post spike money deposited into this entity called BTC was over hyped media fuelled speculation. People thinking it was an endless supply of profits.\nIt's price has been pushed up beyond its actual value due to high demand based off speculative scarcity.\nIt's no conspiracy, or scam, just the nature of the human psyche to herd along. Bitcoin went nuts, reports came out, people overspend, bitcoin falls. Duh.\n\nSo if bubble is all or bust, and people strongly back the structure of decentralised currency (are we all not anarchists at heart), then suredly these recent investors think a bubble pop is impossible. But let's change our visualisation from a soapy suds bubble cleanly disintegrating into a puff of vapour, and instead consider the pink hubba-bubba deflated on one side, slathered over the chin of some dirtbag teenager over confident in their own bubble-blowing prowess.\nThat bubble just needs some chewin. Perhaps a bit of saliva. Get the flavours goin again. See if next time it can prove itself a little more useful.\nCurse you visual metaphors!!\n\nYou think everyone can get rich?\nFor money to have intrinsic value, there must be a whole bunch of people who want it and don't have it.\n\nDon't buy on dips! Buy when everyone has something else popping up on their home screen or tv news. Away from the volatile drama of crazies mortgaging their sisters for BTC!",

He has a few cohorts in the game that are assisting him.  Bitcoin is what people hate...Purity... perfect..not yet but on its way..yet pure untainted by the likes of someone or group that wants to be the money czar of the world.  Bitcoin's purity is what impassions the community not the used car salesman schtick.  Has it changed my thesis...no..the purity will prevail, bitcoin will reach extraordinary heights, and will evolve to the standard for money exchange.   You are from London, then you are quite aware of the times we are in...quite disruptive, Brexit, Trump, Bitcoin. Yes its all messy and some don't quite get it.  But the disruption will and is is happening and it is unstoppable.  And for a demographic, white male, USA, California, seasoned,  and trader for over 20 years.  ",

This correction is evidence of that.\n\nAs for me, I have faith that we will see a rebound, although I doubt it will be as rapid as many in here would like to believe.  I'd be thrilled with something remotely resembling steady, solid growth towards 20k by July 18.  But that won't happen, the roller coaster ride will continue as it has since BTC's inception.  I Hold BTC and several other cryptos (Including DOGE at the behest of my daughter... LOL) and I continue to hold and add to the portfolio.\n\nThe volatility degrades BTC-as-Currency arguments.  And I would wager a good chunk of my holdings that manipulation is playing a big hand in that volatility.",

            "Text": "You'll need to wait until:\n\n1. Your transaction makes it to a block (more precisely: a miner includes your transaction in a block that said miner successfully manages to append to the blockchain). How long this takes depends on the fees in the transaction: your transaction is competing with the other transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain, and miners will prefer to include those that pay the highest fees per byte. Once your transaction makes it to a block, that'll be your first confirmation.\n\n2. After #1 happens, you'll need to wait further, until another block is mined. That'll be the 2nd confirmation of your transaction. This will take a somewhat random amount of time (it depends on the delay for a miner to find this block), but on average that should take around 10 minutes.\n\nSo if #1 happened now, you're looking at another ~10 minutes way (could occasionally be a bit longer).\n\nHope that helps.",

            "Text": "The third axis that always needs to be considered at the same time is centralization. It\u2019s not difficult to design a low-fee, high-transaction token that is not censorship resistant. The Core team is trying to create and maintain a network that is resistant to attacks even at the nation-state level \u2014 attacks far beyond what we have seen thus far. They aren\u2019t trying to be the new Visa, they are trying to replace central banks with a system in which no one has the ability to cook the books.\n\nThe value of bitcoin is primarily due to the secure and decentralized nature of the information the ledger contains. A decentralized blockchain is not an efficient payment system for uses in which censorship resistance is less important. Reducing decentralization would reduce the core value of bitcoin. If blocks were large enough to increase node centralization, or if a small group of people were able to implement a hard fork that undoes transactions on the chain, it\u2019s possible that some of the growing pains would be alleviated, but I would expect the price to be much lower too, since PayPal is already a pretty good system for centralized peer-to-peer payments.",

And to be honest, take away the names/history there are several coins that meet or beat both Bitcoin forks imo. LTC has faster block times for example. ETH dealt with scaling without the drama and has created a whole other niche industry around ICO's. Monero has privacy. Ripple is a safe port in a storm....\n\nSeriously, if you don't know what to pick but you do know you want 'in', buy a bundle of the main ones. It's how large cap ETF's work in the stock market.",

Solutions like Segwit and layer2+ networks allow a scaling that is more sustainable and allow exponential gains to accommodate possible future scaling walls, instead of having to linearly gain from adding more size to the block.\n\n\nBCH is controlled and already under a 51% dominance.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZp7UGgBR0I\n\n\nTo give an example... \n\n------------------------------------------\nTake the telegraph... 1 line, 1 communication allowed, limited to the human response time.\n\nWE NEED TO SEND MORE DATA!\n\nSo.. \n\nBCASH approach is like putting many telegraph line one next to the other, this would surely work, but only very important and rich people would have the possibility to send to much information at that speed and they would effectively manage and monopoly all communication systems.\n\nCore approach is like trying to find a way to improve over the current technology, instead of replicating..\nMaybe let machine record/send messages, this would allow a faster communication that probably wouldn't compete with 10 or 100 lines in parallel since people would still be needed to read and input a reply. But after that, we all know, we ended up developing the internet, and everything you are using right now is built from the basic principle to let current run along a copper wire (this still is layer 1 of the ISO/OSI network stack).\n\nSo... what do you want to do? more telegraphs or we aim for the internet? \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPS: Sorry for my english",

But if you're this worked up over the dip and not able to look at it from this sort of perspective of crypto history. Then maybe you should consider pulling your money out and staying away from it. It will go back up (hopefully). You shouldn't bet anything you aren't able to lose. Key word is bet. No one can predict this, if it goes up past 20k it will dip at some point again and again. One thing we all know from bitcoin past year is. It dips then it breaks through reaching a higher price then before. \nAlso be mindful that this market is fairly un regulated, if one new regulation passes. This bubble could pop just like that. So keep informed, you're betting with pros and simple folk. Usually the pros end up the winners. ",

Could be a week, a few weeks or even a few months, but it'll climb back up there. Just sit tight and find ways to tighten your budget in the meantime. And please don't ever put your financial stability (and that of your family) at risk again. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Everyone in here believes bitcoin will continue to rise over time, but no investment is ever a sure thing.",

Gox crashed and BTC went from $1000 to $200. I understand somewhat your desperation, but BTC is in a much better place right now. It will bounce back impo. Just gotta brace yourself everytime an attack or a scandal happen. Don't invest in something you don't believe in. And if you do believe in Bitcoin, then you will have to endure the growing pains that come along with it.\n\nHowever, whatever you do, DO NOT act impulsively. do some reasearch and make an informed decision. Before you do something retarded that you will regret. Good luck",

Until like a week ago when I got my Ledger (because again, all in, gotta protect dem gainz) - and now I can't move any of my coin out of my Breadwallet because they don't let me set a high enough fee and I'm already paying hundreds of dollars. \n\nAnd for whatever reason, no other wallet is working right now when I try to recover using my private keys. I've tried Mycelium and Greenaddress and both give an error message. Should be noted that I have used these same seed words to restore my wallet to my phone in the past. \n\nSo to recap, I can't even follow the advice that has been spread as gospel by the /r/bitcoin community - to store your savings offline in a hardware wallet. Not your keys, not your bitcoin, etc etc. Can't even affordably follow procedures to safeguard my bitcoin anymore. How secure do you think this makes me in Bitcoin? I've had no problem at all moving my Litecoin, BCash, or ZCash to my ledger. All quick, easy, and affordable. With Bitcoin, my money is literally stuck right now unless I can find a way to recover my wallet to an app that will let me pay 20% of my money in transaction fees to actually move it.",

By your own admission you're not educated on the topic yet you hate the subject of the topic more than anyone? What you're saying is you're letting a bunch of people on the internet's opinion about someone influence you to hate, and this is dangerous.\n\nIf you care enough to do your research on him and still hate him more than anyone after, fine go ahead. But make it your own decision, don't let strangers drive you to blind hatred towards people. For the record I think he's a dick, but I also don't spend much time at all thinking about him.",

If you're buying in at any point in time, and terribly worried about short term changes, you should zoom out and see the cycles that Bitcoin goes through, and understand that in the grand scheme of things an 8% drop is likely temporary pain.  Particularly when you consider the number of people that have been warning about a correction coming up for the last month.",

Now those same people have been asking me\"so how's your Bitcoin doing? Is it a good time to get in now?\"\n\nSo the real fools are the ones that didn't want to take the chance when a few did (props to those who held through the bubble burst of 2014) and the hype train is in full force so now everybody wants in. Sure there might be another \"bubble burst\" but it'll come back stronger as it has done before.\n\nAnd if this is the real end, then props to you for seeing it and calling it out.",

There is always a hyperinflation before a crash. On the way up they all said it wasn't a bubble and denied anyone who said so, then they said it was a new paradigm when things grew and grew without stopping, then when it started to crash they denied it saying it's just a dip, then when it went down even further they denied it because they were afraid, until finally they accepted right before rock bottom.\n\nThis is a textbook bubble.\n\nEdit: Came back to say fuck yeah bitches.",

You would need a transaction value of at least $4000 for the fee to be 1%. That is just absurd on so many levels, because a majority of people dont even have that kind of money. Whats the point of decentralization if only a select few can use it. How much worse is a 2MB, or 4MB compared to a 1MB block when it comes to decentralization? Surely a mere 1MB -> 2MB change doesnt immediately mean bitcoin is super centralized.",

The problem, it seems, is that Core devs have taken a hard line on this in the past and aren\u2019t willing to compromise. To me, it seems like we are making a big bet that segwit and LN will solve all the problems. We just have to hope that they are right... that\u2019s why I\u2019m worried. ",

So you need to transfer the funds in (can take up to 5 days for the ACH transfer) and then you click buy, and the price locks in instantly then... right?\n\nI had previously been thinking that you click buy, then Gemini asks you how you want to fund, and *then* you enter your bank information. But that doesn't seem to be the case, so you have to do the funds transfer and wait for however long that takes, right?",

Between tx times, fees, and volatility, it must be without a doubt the single most useless currency ever circulated. \"store of value\" is a cope meme that popped up out of no where in the last couple months when it was clear that bitcoin had become antiquated and could never serve it's original purpose.  The ONLY purpose it has is to buy it and that a \"greater fool\" will come along who will buy it off of you for more. That works for long enough but eventually you run out of fools as the price gets so absurdly high and no one is THAT dumb. That is the point we are at. the party is over. They just flipped on the lights and you look around the bar and you see everyone still left hanging around at 3am for how they truly look. 'tis but a sober realization. ",

It\u2019s getting a bit spooky as more often than not I can\u2019t explain why it\u2019s making the predictions it\u2019s making.  \n\n[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7kscfy/comment/dridakx?st=JBGQU9KH&sh=df3c408e)  it was showing a drop in the 24 hrs to 15 or 15.5.   I didn\u2019t think it was realistic but we\u2019re now near 15.5.  \n\nIt will continue to fluctuate for the next while but something big is coming.

Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst, so to speak. There will likely be many corrections between now and the moon. Some minor, and quite possibly some major. Back in 2013, there was a horrifying correction which probably shook most people out of the market. Those who had faith (along with a few lucky ones who simply walked away and forgot about it) were rewarded. It's a very important lesson for everyone to remember, because it could happen again. When it does, HODL and be patient and brave. That isn't a message of pessimism; it's a wise message of inspiration.",

            "Text": "[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/7kqk2g/stellar_lumens_hodl_alert_2017_round_up/) from r/stellar. \n\n\u2022 **Lumens vs. Bitcoin:** Jed McCaleb spoke at Distributed Markets in 2017 about the advantages, but more importantly, the disadvantages of Bitcoin. Listen to the talk [here](https://youtu.be/GIMOrsPxlZg). Jed said, \u201cBitcoin is this awesome innovation. The first thing it does is converts a real world resource, electricity, into a digital asset. So it takes something from the real world and puts it into the digital realm. The second thing it does is provides immutable public record. It\u2019s basically a database that everyone can see but no one change arbitrarily\u2026 That\u2019s great, Bitcoin solves the double spin problem [ of proving possession and transmitting volume]\u2026 [However, to fix the problems of bitcoin] you might think well maybe we\u2019ll just kind of keep adding [software] to Bitcoin until we get there, but that\u2019s not really the way software works. You want to have the design from the beginning and solve these simple issues. Bitcoin was designed to be a new currency, **it wasn\u2019t really designed to be this unifying universal payment network. So that\u2019s what Stellar does**. It solves these three remaining issues.\u201d  \n\n\n\u2022 **Lumens vs. Bitcoin #2:** According to [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-mining-guzzles-energyand-its-carbon-footprint-just-keeps-growing/), \"Bitcoin mining guzzles energy - and it's carbon footprint just keeps growing.\" Wired says \"Today, **each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the US for one day**... The total energy use of this web of hardware is huge\u2014an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year. More than 150 individual countries in the world consume less energy annually. And that power-hungry network is currently increasing its energy use every day by about 450 gigawatt-hours, roughly the same amount of electricity the entire country of Haiti uses in a year.\" Because Stellar is based on a consensus algorithm rather than mining, it takes much less energy to run the Stellar network. The Poseidon Foundation decided to build their platform on Stellar rather than Ethereum or Bitcoin because of this [(twitter source)](https://twitter.com/Poseidon_NGO/status/938273406998507521).\n\n\u2022 **Lumens ICO tokens vs. Ethereum ICO tokens:** According to [Stellar.org](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/), \"traditionally, ICO tokens have been issued on the Ethereum network in the form of ERC20 tokens. ERC20 tokens are easy to issue and are infinitely customizable using Ethereum\u2019s smart contracting language. However, recent events have highlighted and exacerbated some weaknesses of the network, including **slow transaction processing times** for the network during ICOs and **increasingly expensive gas prices** (by fiat standards) for transactions and smart contract execution. Moreover, many organizations require **only basic tokens**; they adopt the risk of Ethereum\u2019s Turing complete programming language without taking advantage of many of its benefits.\"  \n\n\n\"While Ethereum has the most expressive programming capabilities, we believe Stellar is the best choice for ICOs that do not require complex smart contracts. Stellar\u2019s primary goal is to facilitate issuing and trading tokens, especially those tied to legal commitments by known organizations, such as claims on real-world assets or fiat currency.\"  \n\n\n\u2022 **Stellar vs. Ethereum #2:** The median transaction time on Stellar is 5 seconds, compared to approximately 3.5 minutes on Ethereum [(source)](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/). Stellar has a negligible transaction fee (.00001 XLM ~= $0.0000002) with no gas fee for computation, while depending on the complexity of the computation, the median cost for a transfer on the Ethereum network is $0.094. **Security:** While both Stellar and Ethereum run on a decentralized network, the Stellar network has fewer security pitfalls. Stellar uses atomic transactions comprised of simple, declarative operations while Ethereum uses turing complete programming capabilities which produces less auditable code and **greater risk of exploitable vulnerabilities** [(source)](https://www.stellar.org/blog/using-stellar-for-ico/). **Recently, a security flaw in the Ethereum network froze millions of dollars**. According to [Mobius ariticle](https://medium.com/mobius-network/ethereum-parity-wallet-bug-strengthens-case-for-stellar-8accd4a79402) written by David Gobaud, \"On November 6, 2017, Github user deveps199 'accidentally' triggered a bug in Parity, a popular Ethereum mult-sig wallet, that froze more than $152 million in Ether across 151 addresses. The bug impacted several token sales including Polkadot, which has had ~$98 million out of its recent $145 million sale frozen.\"  \n\n\n\"Mobius had none of its ongoing pre-sale Ether frozen because **we do not trust Ethereum\u2019s Smart Contract based multi-sig wallets given the vast Turing complete attack surface** and did not use one. Security broadly is one of the main reasons **the MOBI token that powers the DApp Store is a Stellar Protocol token** and not an Ethereum token.\"  \n\n\n\u2022 **Lumens vs. Ripple:** According to [Wall Street Bitcoin Exchange](http://www.wallstreetbitcoinexchange.com/stellar-lumens-versus-ripple---an-in-depth-look-at-stellar.html), \"Many investors like to compare the company [Stellar] to Ripple, and there are a lot of similarities, being that some of the founders worked on the Ripple team. In what can now be looked at as another blockchain development drama that plays out on chat boards and in interviews all across the globe. Stellar declared they fixed Ripple\u2019s problems with their hard fork, however, Ripple has failed to [admit to any of the flaws](https://www.coindesk.com/counterargument-value-proposition-ripples-xrp-token/) in its design that the Stellar team has pointed out.\" The article concludes by saying, \"We Choose XLM Over XRP For 2018. That is why we are going with Stellar Lumens over Ripple in our portfolio for the rest of 2017 and 2018. After holding Ripple for a long time this year, it just never seems to make the big break like other names with bigger market caps like Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin have. While we are holding on most all our larger market caps, we feel that Stellar Lumens will be one of the break out coins for 2018.\"  ",

So 6 months even in a pie-in-the-sky perfect scenario where the developers finish testing and rolling out ASAP and all the major players like Coinbase adopt it immediately. Reality is, we're still waiting for Segwit to really be adopted and it's been 6 months. You've seen how much can change in another 6 months right? That's way more than enough time for BTC and BCH to flip values.",

            "Text": "It seems like plenty of people are indeed willing to pay such fees, which is why the cost of being included in a highly secure bitcoin block has been bid up to that price. If max decentralization isn\u2019t your primary interest, I would use another payment mechanism, until second layer solutions arrive. Bitcoin will be fine in the short to medium term without the on-chain, low-security-needed payment system use case. That\u2019s not the fundamental value that holds up the price.\n\nThis is a network worth hundreds of billions of dollars. With time they can build a solid and cheap payment network on top of that network, but if they optimize for that now and become too centralized, they can never go back and regain decentralization later. Everyone wants low fees, but not at the cost of risking what makes the network better than BCH or ETH.",

Bitstamp is similar to trading pairs, but has lower fees and trades XRP. Bittrex and Poloniex are major crypto-only exchanges with much wider altcoin support.\n\n> I want to be able to get the fucking price that I see on the graph when I click the button.\n\nUse limit orders and do some reading on maker/taker fees for the exchange.

ETH weakens, you'll be paying more for Alt XYZ and the same would be true for BTC.\n\nAlso the order book would be thinner on the ETH pairs due to lesser liquidity so getting filled may be an issue.\n\nLastly you won't get to trade all Alts with ETH as compared to BTC.\n\nSome pairs like ETC/ETH have a reasonable correlation so they can use useful to trade with ETH.",

The real capital that is in play is smart money now. You may not like bankers, but they have been doing their homework for months and they are buying in because they understand exactly what they are getting. They aren't interested in \"electronic cash\" because cash is a tiny share of the global economy. It matters to the masses, because that's what they see every day, but it's one of the weakest value propositions for BTC.

Bcash has the upper hand for now by having an extra lane on the highway, but with second layer solutions getting close to completion with Bitcoin we aren't talking a highway with more lanes we are talking a new means of transportation altogether. Mass transit, bike lanes, rail, flying vs adding more car lanes. The goal for bitcoin is to have less cars on the road altogether. That is why I think bitcoin will succeed in the long term. ",

Ok, knowing that and that the average amount of investments of bitcoin buyers is 0.1 per bitcoin. Roughly averaging $1000 lets say. Now times that by roughly 35,000,000. And you get a $35 billion drop essentially conrtibuting significantly to the 25% drop in the market cap. And this isn't even including other countries that may celebrate. I may be talking out my ass.

            "Text": "Exactly.  This is what the [Bitfinex LTC/BTC chart looks like](https://imgur.com/a/Cey41)\n\nThis is using 5 minute candles - I generally watch 1 minute ones though, but wanted to show a larger time frame in that screenshot.\n\nBasically it goes up and down on a fairly consistent pattern, with a slight trend upward favoring LTC.  Each one of those candles that is the size of the couple on the left hand side is a trade opportunity.  You won't make a ton of coin doing this unless you have a decent sized stash to trade.  I find it relatively safe though because I believe both BTC and LTC have a future, at least certainly in the short term.  ETH and XMR are probably good choices too.  Again, the most important part is to not trade emotionally and have confidence that whatever you are buying on the dips that you believe its going to go back up.  \n\nYou might miss out on some gains on either side doing this, but again you have to just be prepared for that and not get worked up if you miss a big rise on one side or the other.  If your general plan is to just hold BTC, well if LTC rises you wouldn't have benefited from that anyways.  Swapping between the 2, maybe you get lucky and you catch a surge on the LTC side - of course it goes both ways, you could get unlucky and miss surges on both sides.  Often times some coins do surge together though, just one side more than the other so its not like you totally lose out.\n\nEDIT: just to add - for me personally... the only way I can do non-emotional trades is to trade between 2 coins that I believe are both winners in the long run and won't be unhappy about holding for a period of time.  The FOMO doesn't hit nearly as hard this way.  FOMO trading generally always leads to you losing.\n\nEDIT 2: I should also say... if you want to try trading, I'd highly recomend you do some research on how to read the different types of charts out there and what some of the basic market indicators are.  See if you can find a site that lets you trade with pretend coins first to see if you can get a handle on it before you put your actual coins on the line.",

Roger Ver is some guy that claims he is the savior of the coin or something, but imagine a situation that he died, would anything change? No the coin is coded and the code stays. Roger Ver has no influence over the cryptocurrency itself, only the publicity of it, which then has influence on price.\n\nWould i want *Bitcoin Cash* to succeed? Maybe not, there is a lot of manipulation and it is a bad influence on all cryptos, but switching from Bitcoin to *Bitcoin Cash* is not irrational, because **at the current moment** it does its job better **as a currency or a means of exchange**.\n\nIf Bitcoin would fix its issues with fees, then i believe everyone will be more confident and leave *Bitcoin Cash*.",

Its tracking to go below 40% today.\n\nThat means very specifically that all of crypto isn't lagging, its only bitcoin and for very obvious reasons. Transaction fees, transaction time and mempool bloat.\n\nLet's be fair here, the people who are selling crypto for Christmas gifts (why would anyone sell their deflationary currency for a couple hundred in gifts anyways?) Aren't making market moves of billions, nor do they influence price factors.\n\nSimply put, the market is losing confidence in btc and pouring money into alts.\n\nETH is not down 20%. Dash is not down 20%. Bch is not down 20%. All of these are riding all time highs while btc stagnates.\n\nIf you've been tracking (as I do very closely every day, if you've ever stopped by r/cryptocurrency you'll see a couple posts of mine,) this is not a trend from the last couple bch days.\n\nAs the mempool goes up, as people get frustrated and fees cost more, this will cost bitcoin (and specifically bitcoin, not cryptocurrency, though they suffer a little via trading pairs) market share and dominance to alts that function doing their intended purpose.\n\nHopefully that was a good read.",

Scaling is a major concern, and with over 270k unconfirmed transactions with high average trx fees, bitcoin needs to do better regardless of real or fake volume, otherwise it puts off a lot of people from using it. This isn\u2019t about someone else being better, this is about bitcoin needing to be better. Even if ethereum didn\u2019t exist, bitcoin fees are too high.",

Ripple may go higher, or lower, who knows. But it's not going to overtake bitcoin. It's just not. Just like everyone thought ETH might, but it didnt.

            "Text": "Increasing block size doesn't solve the problem of transaction processing latency for point-of-sale retail use. All it does is increase transaction throughput, which increases the number of transactions that can be processed each 10 minutes, thereby lowering fees. BTC has lower fees at the moment because of this, but it's still not really useful as \"electronic cash\", for the simple reason that nobody will wait for 10 minutes to pay for a cup of coffee - they'll just use Apple Pay or Visa instead (and they should). Litecoin brings latency down to 2.5 minutes, but it still doesn't work for point-of-sale street-retail. Dash can do it, but the best technical solution I have seen is Lightning. The real downside of increasing block size is that the technical requirements for handling larger blocks (compute power of miners, network traffic) push small, independent and individual miners out of the pools. That may be why so much of the BTC mining activity is happening in China today, on new hardware bought by large companies, backed by the state. For folks with a libertarian bent, this should be scary.",

I can\u2019t explain the confidence changing so wildly within an hour and more confusing is why the price prediction is consistent despite the variance.

            "Text": "BCH has a malleability issue because LN needs SegWit in order for it to work and BCH does not have that at this moment. SegWit also increases the block size to 1.7mb so there will be some scaling solutions there. SegWit and LN are just two scaling solutions. There are active developments into Third layer scaling solutions that step above LN even and have some interesting futuristic properties outside of currency transactions, even. \n\nWith SegWit and LN being widely adopted I can see a huge majority of transactions being done on the second layer which will help the congestion on the blockchain. \nKeeping under 2mb for a blockchain makes a ton of sense since after we start to get past 2mb it is hard not for nodes to be decentralized as the data and bandwidth required to run a node would be enormous. I run a full node at home for Bitcoin and I can easily push 250 to 300gb a month in uploads. That's just for a 1mb Blockchain. Imagine 4mb or even 8mb as some people are talking about that. No way can a person run a node like that. Nodes would then be run from data centers making it centralized which is not good. 54% of nodes for Bcash are in China running on Alibaba virtual servers. It is already centralized from the get go. ",

            "Text": "This is a ridiculous statement. Ethereum is the platform and ether is the currency. Ether (the currency) already performs much better than bitcoin in terms of speed and transaction costs. Oh did I mention it is doing this while doing twice the transactions bitcoin currently is? \n\nAs for store of value - please explain what makes Bitcoin better right now because I am not seeing it. Beyond the right now - as soon as Casper is implemented and proof of stake goes lives - Ethereum automatically becomes a better store of value. Free ethers just for hodling? Yes please. \n\nOn top of all this - you mention alt coins are in a bubble. Yes - most will fail but you do realize more than half of these (and dApps) run on top of Ethereum and thus need ether - the same ether you claim isn\u2019t as good of a store of value. When you buy ether your are buying the gasoline that literally runs the entire ecosystem. \n\nHonestly - as I see it right now - I don\u2019t see a single thing bitcoin has on ethereum aside from first mover advantage. That being said - I am willing to listen and be proven wrong so please hit me with a sound rebuttal. ",

            "Text": "First off inflation is necessary for economic growth. Economies are driven by consumption, a steady decline in a currencies value encourages people to by goods sooner rather than later. Society is ok with this erosion of purchasing power because income rises with this decline in value. On the flip side, a currency with steady deflation would be catastrophic for an economy, when currencies gain value over time what incentive is there for anyone to buy anything today when they could buy even more of it tomorrow for the same price? (think the HODL culture of Bitcoin) What ends up happening is consumption grinds to a halt. While it may seem giving people more value for their savings over time is a good thing, the reality is business fail due to revenues plummeting which leads to massive unemployment only further exacerbating the consumption problem, this is precisely what happened during the Great Depression. As for the claim that Bitcoin is more sound than fiat currencies, you said yourself there is no obligation to settle debts, how the hell is a financial system supposed to function without trust  that debts will be repaid? Why would anybody give out any loans if their debtors could just take the money and run? Bitcoin is in truth a terrible currency, it is worthless as a medium of exchange (this again is evident by HODL culture) no body uses Bitcoin for day to day transactions. On top of this it is also a awful store of value, the massive price swings that Bitcoin has isn't a sign of its strength, it's a sign of its weakness and volatility, nobody would feel comfortable holding their life savings in Bitcoin over the Dollar. If Bitcoin was really a better currency than the Dollar, no body would care about how many Dollars they could get if they cashed out their holdings. Bitcoin if anything is much more an asset than a currency. Now for Bitcoin being a bubble, do you seriously believe the near exponential growth in it's price is from people suddenly within the last month and a half seeing the usefulness of block chain tech after all the years it has been around? The truth is the price rise is due to speculation and the popularity this speculation brought has drawn more and more people to purchase bitcoin further driving up the price, there is a reason people have called Bitcoin a ponzi scheme. No asset's price has risen indefinitely and Bitcoin wont be any different.",

This is a different statement than saying Bitcoin is going to be a \"world\" currency used by all individuals to exchange value and store value.  You currently cannot go to Dell or Microsoft (like you can with Bitcoin) and pay with Ether, and further to that I don't see any retailer adopting Ether as a means of value exchange because that is not it's main use case.\n\nAs a store of value, as in my original reply to the original poster, it is currently the best because it has the strongest development pool (who are specifically developing Bitcoin as a store of value and as a means of exchange of value) and the strongest brand (never underestimate a strong brand).",

In fact, I believe there is space for many different tokens with many specializations to be mass adopted for whatever the needs are in the future. I can also agree with you that Bitcoin's future is unknown and I just don't know if it will be the de-facto store of value. All I know, right now at this moment, it has a very strong brand and a strong development support with Layer 2 innovations on the way (well, in all honesty they are already available but are not widely adopted) which are ahead (in terms of innovation and technology) of most of its competition. As Andreas A. states, the most valuable token/coin is the one that is most used and adopted. There will always be something new and better around the corner, but it doesn't mean it will always end up being used.",
