            "Text": "Groundhog week anybody? We\u2019re exactly where we were a week ago. Bitcoin has been very slow... volume has been diminished. People are still optimistic despite the market cap being below the Feb. 05 low. We still have no clue what the bottom is. Everyone thought it was $8K after its crash in February. The whales can still push it down for a lower bottom. There is tremendous resistance around $6.5K. But, what is behind that resistance? Is it the whales...is it the buying and selling trade war? I was expecting Bitcoin to be $5.5K. Perhaps I am right but it\u2019s just being delayed. Eventually, if there isn\u2019t any bullish action, people especially the whales will get tired of investing and move their money to traditional investments like stocks, bonds, physical commodities. I really dread a $6K-$10K movement for the rest of the year. Bitcoin today is like the hot chick who got some terrible plastic surgery.",

Is this your own assessment or based upon something you've read? \n\nI can understand why trade wars influence the price of certain commodities and goods, but BTC doesn't function in the same way, and, if anything, it has often played the role of a deflationary investment vehicle. You really believe that the average BTC buyer is concerned about a trade war so they are keeping their money in the bank instead?\n\nNot trying to sound harsh...I just don't think the normie invasion of late 2017 was comprised of people conversant in international economics and the regulatory environment surrounding financial markets and institutions.",

So big parties which can trade without transaction costs (so called market makers) can make a (almost) riskless profit by selling on Bitfinex and simultaneously buying on one of the other exchanges.",

If you're short and you can drive price down with sell orders, but with no intention to actually sell, you can get out with more profit or at least less of a loss, iow's you can buy lower to exit With margin trading you can in fact hold both positions. \n\nAnd you certainly don't dump your entire fortune on the market at once if you're trying to get the best exit price. You do it slowly and softly to get the best possible price. ",
