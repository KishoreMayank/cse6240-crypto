There has not been a day where Bitcoin has dropped by this much and not retraced over the course of the following day.  Or check out the history of the 1929 stock market crash.  The market retraced after Black Friday, Black Monday, and Black Tuesday (check Wikipedia).  If the price of Bitcoin is going to fall, it's going to fall slowly over a period, not to zero in a day.  Check the price tomorrow or later today and see what I mean -- it'll retrace.  It could even potentially go on a bull run.  The fear mongering is so overblown.  But if you want out, and don't think it'll ever come back, at least wait for the retrace to sell. Jeez.",

It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.\n",

Sounds slow compared to bitcoin, but at least it has actual value, is recognized internationally, and won't dip 50% in a month. \n\nAlso now I can sell some stock and buy some more bitcoin now that it's at 11k.

            "Text": "The real question is what is your investment time frame? Cant blame people who want to lock in some gains if they got in this time last year, but if your intent is long term (years like me), use this as an opportunity to build a balanced portfolio at a discount (BTC fell less than alts, measure in satoshis). Get a hobby, and try to sleep. \nA universal truth is market timing doesn't work - missing the 10 best days of S&P 500 over the last 20 years would cost you 1/3 of your annualized returns (including Tech bubble, 2008 crash etc.). This is no different and fear of additional losses will make you miss an epic snap back when it eventually happens. \n\nI am a fundamentals guy, and here is what I see: \n(1) typical mid Jan tax consolidation pattern repeated over past 5 yrs straight\n(2) A maturing asset class - you wouldn't have Futures, Goldman Sachs, JPM, and major institutions investing heavily if it was a fad \"St. Louis Fed: In Some Ways, Bitcoin Is More Robust Than Many Fiat Currencies\"\n(3) Temporary technical pressure from FUD, exchanges overwhelmed with new users, whales short term trading\n(4) Family offices and HNW individuals looking at it seriously as a portfolio diversifier\n(5) Bonus and tax rebates will fuel large flows in the next 4 weeks, cant tell you how many times I heard \"I am ready to go as soon as I get my bonus check\" the past few weeks\n\n\nIt will snap back, the question is how soon, as more FUD mongering may deter institutional investors. \n\n-Keep Calm and Crypto On",

No tracing the owners, easy to transfer money, and its pretty much the only currency used there now days. The DW is huge too. After all these phoney investors hop off the train, bitcoin will flourish again seeing as the DW will always be around and in need of a privacy currency.

It will go up again, but I now have to use the depreciated value of my BTC to buy alts because if I wait until BTC begins to go up again my alts will have likely also stabilized.\n\nI\u2019m not really pissed at the market, I\u2019m pissed that I was uninformed about how long it would take to receive my BTC after buying it on Coinbase. If I had my way I would have bought my alts right then and there but I had to wait 8 days. It sucks that I was locked into the BTC price at the time of purchase and wasn\u2019t able to do anything with it. IMHO they should refund me the difference. \n\nIf I buy something I should get it right then, not 8 days later when I\u2019ve already lost a ton of money. They took away all of my agency in what I wanted to do with my BTC.",

            "Text": "If you just dumped all your crypto on a single exchange as one giant lump you'd crash the price on that exchange and then arbitrage bots would come in and make money off your stupidity.  Imagine if somebody wanted to sell 200k bitcoins on GDAX all at once when normally only like 20-50k are traded a day.  You'd fill all the sell orders and the bulk of your coins would sell for next to nothing.\n\nIf you have a shitload of crypto and suddenly want to sell all of it for some reason, whats the best way to do it to maximize your fiat gains?  Assuming its all the same type of crypto, you'd get a better price if you converted pieces of it into various other cryptos and sold it slowly over time across various exchanges.  This way you can slowly lower the price across various exchanges and get a decent amount of fiat for your crypto.  \n\nIf you crash the price on a single exchange, you might sell 25% of it at the top and then the other 75% for next to nothing because you hit the market with an amount far larger than what is traded on a day to day basis.  Then people come in and buy from you for almost nothing and sell it on another exchange where the price hasn't dropped yet.",

So if you bought 1 bitcoin when it was at, say, $15k then you will get 1 bitcoin. The only thing is now your 1 bitcoin is worth $11k and that's on you as an investor, not Coinbase.\n\nAt least, that's how Coinbase worked when I bought some time ago and my order was pending for a couple days, which is a ridiculous amount of time.",

            "Text": "I think this question has been answered a few times before but I can take a stab at why it's not a good idea.\n\n1. Exchanges can be hacked both externally and internally. Someone else can walk away with your money.\n\n2. An exchange can be shut down involuntarily due to govt regulation. You will lose your coins or at best have to deal with a nightmare scenario in restoring them.\n\n3. An exchange like coinbase owns your account and thus the money in it. They can lock you out of your account same way PayPal could lock you out, for something that may not even be your fault . Just have a look at the number of locked accounts on the coinbase subreddit.\n\nSo bottom line you want to be in complete control of your money , and ideally keep it offline especially if you're not a day trader type.\n\n",

You have to verify your identity on most exchanges, and you\u2019ll definitely have to verify your bank account. The micro transactions they deposit in your account for verification purposes took 3-5 days to appear on my bank statement. So... Unless your bank is very speedy about posting transactions, it may not work out for ya. \n\nI hope it does! i just felt like you deserved to know  that it\u2019s not as easy as going to Coinbase, signing up with an email address and slapping your Visa info in there.

China making an exit in no way disrupts the crypto markets long term.  It creates this current down cycle but for sure there will be a myriad of posters getting on here weeks and months from now wishing they had hodled or bought more at lower prices.  With a 98% dev support for BTC how exactly is it you think this is something crypto markets will never recover from?  Futures markets are betting HEAVILY against your statement.  People who spent their lives in currency trading are betting HEAVILY against your statement.  Low prices make is SUPER DUPER easy for large scale commercial firms to come in and scoop up millions at discount prices.  By all mean brother...tuck tail and run.  Sell all you have and listen to Warren Buffet who knows jack shit about crypto.  THEY are the ones creating the FUD because THEY have the massive fear of being marginalized by blockchain and losing hundreds of billions in transaction fees.  So much disinformation being spread right now and the masses of sheep are doing EXACTLY what THEY know the sheep will do.\n\nDon't take my word for it brother.  Sell everything you have.  Please.",

Other new technologies take so much to pitch for funding and attention. Crypto gets them much easier nowadays. Good projects draws attention pretty much immediately.

Some people need to sell to pay back loans from family, tuition, credit card bills, food, mortgage and are already stressed due to the crash. You mocking them on the internet shows how self-centered you are as a human being. Even if bitcoin makes a recovery, it can\u2019t save your poor personality which matter mores than money. We get it, you\u2019re optimistic which is great.. but you don\u2019t need to be a jerk while showing your enthusiasm.",

In my opinion it isn\u2019t worth trying to pinpoint what the factor is that is driving the price down because it\u2019s likely to simply be market forces at work. \n\nBTC saw staggering gains throughout 2017. It\u2019s often the case that the price becomes more voilatile and starts to decline after such a price gain. If this never happened and it really did just inflate to a higher and higher price than it probably would burst like some people claim. These periods of decline are healthy for bitcoins future as a currency. They contribute to long term stability.\n\nI just hope what we aren\u2019t about to witness is a replay of 2013/2014: Exponential gains followed by a bear market that took a couple of years to recover from. Personally, I\u2019m far too impatient for that sort of thing. I really hope things recover soon and we start bulling again.",

Properly priced, there are better ways to make money. Talk about big finance shorting btc is mostly memes coming from people who don't really know how finance works sorry. Ultimately, there's very little interest in btc or crypto beyond maybe simply holding it as a hedge asset in a diversified portfolio. There's a much easier explanation for this \"crash\" and that is reversion to fundamentals after a ridiculous year of hype.",

But it might take a while for Gemini to approve your account, so this might not help you if you don't already have a Gemini account, but you could try it.  Also, if your bank isn't one that Gemini has support for, you need to do a wire transfer to set up the bank link (for the supported banks you can use ACH transfers which are easier).",

Classic ponzi think LIFE and Monavie. And they might take everyones btc and do an exit scam.\n\nTurns out thats exactly what happened.\n\nEveryone who was silly enough to fall for their paid youtube ads and marketing lost a ton of money.  \n\nCould be them offloading the stolen btc. \n\nBitconnect and bcc is a scam not btc.

It will always cause the maximum possible pain.\nAll the greedy that joined late thought to make easy millions, everyone on facebook became a \"crypto investor\" over night, the taxi driver talked to you about bitcoin and how much it's going up. This is not how it works, unfortunately.\n\nNow be ready for 7k-5k and then a long phase 1-3 years to a new ATH.\nWhen bitcoin is dead and nobody gives a sh*it anymore then it's the time to buy in.\n\nBTW the best hodlers are those who believe in this technology and the crypto revolution, that's how they manage to withstand those 80-90% drops, those who are in solely for the money are weak buyers and are likely to go rekt.",

            "Text": "Who the hell invests in currencies?  Most decent stocks make 15-20% a year in the current market, far more if you play smart. Since Jan 1, my stock picks are up 9%, and I'm not even options trading. BTC is trash for investing at this point by all metrics that matter, assuming you're not day trading dips, which in itself is a dangerous game if you don't know what you're doing. But even still, you can make those profits and far more playing stocks.\n\nThe people HODLing are fine if you've been in it awhile, but if you were a person who bought in over $17k, your money is probably gone until summer, and even then you'll be lucky to break even. The moment BTC hit 16-17k again, inb4 traders hard sell and cause it to plummet again. BTC is not seeing 20k again unless something insane happens like a big player accepting BTC (which is extremely unlikely). People in general are failing to understand the concept of opportunity cost, where the months you spend sitting on BTC that goes up and down without real gains could have been in other investments that have perpetual upward trends.

If at some future date it went higher you'd pay the difference.\n\nThe only vehicle for this kind of trading currently is in BTC futures.\n\nThe term you're looking for is day trading.

The biggest threat to crypto is all this hype and the chicken-headed, fearful, self-help reading, get-rich quick folks getting on board.\n\nWell unfortunately that came to fruition already and now we gotta cope with it.\n\nI - like many believers in the disruptive and empowering nature of this tech - will not sell out this community solely to make enormous profits. I took out a very small percentage of holdings back in December simply to ensure return on my minuscule initial investment back in 2013.\n\nDon\u2019t get into this game to get rich. Get into it for long-term speculation on the technology and the wonders it will one day bring to help us all become a little bit more freed from our modern day masters.",

What kind of sick fuck would want that?\n\nNo, people investing into cryptos are simply because of their greed. You can still believe in the technology instead of dreaming about if bitcoin would hit $1 million a coin.\n\nDon't invest more than you're willing to lose, you will be fine if you do that. If it works out in the end, consider yourself lucky and treat those as extra profits which you didn't have before. If bitcoin price crashes to oblivion, no hard feeling. Don't be those delusional dreamers borrowing money/mortgage their houses betting on cryptos and just hoping to get rich quick. That's how bubble is formed. Greedy pigs deserve to lose everything.",

Above certainly happened and I don't deny that, it doesn't mean this wasn't an outlier though.\nNote that I was originally replying to a comment proposing coordinated naked shorting of extremely volatile forward derivatives with an underlying that goes through extreme swings and is majority held by about 2%-5% of holders as a viable strategy. Also comparing XTB (or whatever the ticker is right now) liquidity and CDS liquidity is just incomparable. All of that would make this kind of play orders of magnitudes more retarded than what you've linked above and I don't see any evidence of this happening whatsoever. Of course if you can argue otherwise I'm all ears.",

A series of derivative transactions involving credit default swaps (CDS) were entered, reportedly as part of the bank's \"hedging\" strategy.

If you know how to read chart, you can gauge people's behaviors and act accordingly. Just a simple reading candlestick can tell you so much about people's psychological mindset. You also have to apply other indicators to further help your judgments. Charts will present many more opportunities in front of you than just you holding.\n\nLike i said, there's no guarantee. If you don't believe this stuff just HODL like rest of the long-term investors do. At the end of the day, it's a gamble, but at least you have more tools to help you taking calculated risk rather than just blind betting.",

            "Text": "Fundamentally Bitcoin is the very first technology to solve the double spending problem which now makes it possible to have a digital currency. Sure you can apply the same thing to other currencies now but if its that simple why don't you just build another Facebook?\n\nThere is no balance sheet or product being produced by Bitcoin. So what? Is your argument that Gold produces a product other than itself, or the American Dollar? Oh yes the Dollar is based on the faith of the federal government. The same government that allowed banks (most likely like the one you work for) destroy the economy, borrow money from tax payers and then lend it back to the tax payer at interest, and actually become BIGGER banks as a result of the crisis rather than break them up. I dont have faith in our monetary system. Not when the fed allows that kind of shit to happen and when you can print as much money as you want at any time. Bitcoins FUNDAMENTAL value is being apart from that system.",

The world is in need of a global currency and Bitcoin can be that currency without being controlled by any centralized authority that has shown time and time again that it cannot be trusted as such. Are you alright with what big banks did to the economy and who had to pay for it? Is it alright with you that as of now you can be told what you can and cannot do with your own funds? Where you can send them and how much you are allowed to send? If you actually desire freedom you would respect Bitcoin for giving it to you.\n\nI don't blame you for feeling how you do about Bitcoin. Spending a career in investment banking pretty much forces you to think that Fiat is bulletproof. Everything that CAN be revolutionized WILL be revolutionized and currency is next in line. \n\n\nEDIT: Also lets not forget that many times in the past major currency changes have taken place. Getting off the Gold standard and it becoming illegal to own a lot of Gold for example. Change always comes with incredibly resistance.",

With most shares, it's receiving a dividend every year or so.\n\nCrypto, and Tesla shares, have no implicit value because if you just have them and can't sell them then you get *nothing*. Even regular currency doesn't have intrinsic value - you can have a million Zimbabwean dollars, but that's not going to help you if the currency collapses.\n\nYou can't just choose to have a different opinion on a technical term definition. \"Intrinsic value\" is a specific term, and it's totally separate from \"market value\".\n\nOnce you understand, you can go back to being condescending to people except with better information.",

            "Text": "I literally say that currencies don't have intrinsic value in my post, besides whatever use you have for the paper they're printed on. Bitcoin also has no intrinsic value. This is factual, not an opinion. That doesn't mean it doesn't have value, since of course you can procure goods and services with it!\n\nWhether that dissuades people or not is a personal decision. I'm totally fine with other people putting their money into BTC, but I'm not going to as I am not comfortable with the relative instability combined with the no intrinsic value. (Either alone would be OK to me, but not together). More power to those who have the faith, but I think there are two good sides to this debate and neither is objectively correct. It's a matter of your own values after a point.",

But the rest of it is kinda against you and anyone who thinks Bitcoin has no intrinsic value but other material objects do. \n\nI don\u2019t know the Finance definition of intrinsic value but the regular definition of intrinsic value is: valuable in and of itself. \n\nYou\u2019re saying (and a lot of people are saying) that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, so it\u2019s not valuable in and of itself.\n\nHowever you seem to imply that gold is intrinsically valuable. So Gold is valuable in and of itself according to you (unless you\u2019re using a special Finance definition).\n\nYet at the same time you say that Gold is only valuable as a means for Jewellery and Science. That to me means it\u2019s not intrinsically valuable. Rather, it\u2019s valuable only insofar as it is a means to another end.\n\nMy point is that Bitcoin is the same as all of these other physical things people claim to have intrinsic value.

Economic bubles are very real. \n\nSure, it is uncertain science and the reasons are not understood. Doesnt make it not real, though. Yet, the whole thing about \u201cpeople buying an asset above its intrinsic value\u201d  makes no sense when talking about bitcoin, as there isn\u2019t really an intrinsic value to begin with.\n\nYes, bitcoin has bubbled before and come out stronger. I think that will happen again. But to say that bubbles aren\u2019t real or that this does not look like a bubble is just lame. Bitcoin could be one big bubble, for all we know. \n\nAlso, that \u201cdumb graph\u201d is something that happens regularly in financial markes, for a number of reasons. Call it stupid all you want. It doesnt make it less of a thing. Arguably, bitcoin has had several major bubbles. Just like the US stock market. And it has eventually come out stronger. Just like the US stock market. Yet, they are still bubbles.",

            "Text": "I pointed to a big rise (1000%) over the course of a year, followed by a dip of 30% in two weeks, then an (almost) return to the high, followed by an even bigger dip.\n\nAnd said: \u201chey, that **looks** like this example of an economic bubble in my textbook\u201d. \n\nPlease tell me where that is wrong. \n\nI never said that bitcoin was going to die or whatever. \n\nYou can call it a \u201cmarket correction\u201d all you want. You can also say that you \u201csupport\u201d in stead of \u201cinvest. You can also say that you \u201chodl\u201din stead of \u201chold\u201d. \n\nWhen this drop is over, it will likely be known as \u201cthe bitcoin bubble of (early) 2018\u201d. That is my point. Just like there was a bubble in 2013 and one in 2011.\n",
