As you know, there is already a joint Franco \u2013 German letter on this point.\n\nCrypto-asset markets are global, with worldwide transactions between investors, consumers and intermediaries.\n\nOn its own, Europe represents only a small share of global cryptocurrency trading, so we need to work together with our partners in the G20 and international standard-setters.\n\nToday's roundtable focused on three main topics:\n\nthe implications of crypto-currencies for financial markets,\n\nthe risks and the opportunities associated with their use,\n\nand the recent development of Initial Coin Offerings.\n\nWe concluded that:\n\nFirst, the blockchain technology holds strong promise for financial markets. To remain competitive, Europe must embrace this innovation.\n\nSecond, crypto-currencies, which are not currencies in the traditional sense, and whose value is not guaranteed, have become subject of considerable speculation.\n\nThis exposes consumers and investors to substantial risk including the risk to lose their investment.\n\nThis is why our third conclusion is that warnings about these risks to consumers and investors are important: these must be clear, frequent, and across all jurisdictions.\n\nFourth, Initial Coin Offerings have become a way for innovative firms in this field to raise substantial amounts of funding.\n\nThis is an opportunity, but there are also problems that expose investors to substantial risk, such as the lack of transparency regarding the identity of the issuers and underlying business plans.\n\nFifth, we need to assess further under what circumstances crypto-currencies and related services are covered by existing regulation.\n\nThis depends very much on the facts and circumstances around specific crypto-tokens.\n\nBased on the assessment of risks and opportunities and the suitability of the existing regulatory framework for these instruments, the Commission will determine if regulatory action at EU level is required.\n\nFinally, crypto-assets present risks relating to money laundering and the financing of illicit activities.\n\nThat is why the Commission proposed that virtual currency exchanges and wallet providers should be subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\n\nThe co-legislators reached an agreement in December, and we invite Member States to prepare for a speedy transposition of this legislation.\n\nTo sum up, the Commission will continue to monitor these markets together with other stakeholders, at EU and international level, including in the G20.\n\nWe stand ready to take action based on an assessment of risks and opportunities.\n\nFollowing upcoming international discussions, we will decide on how to follow up today's roundtable.\n\nThank you.",

What exchange do you recommend for someone who just wants to make small transactions? I'm in the UK, & I don't really have much in the way of ID (no driving licence because I'm disabled and can't drive) and no passport because they're expensive and I've never really needed one. I don't even have a mobile at the moment. \n\nThis shit scares me, but I realise I'm going to have to utilise it if I want to be able to buy certain stuff. Is there anyone out there willing to mentor me...?\n\nPeace\n\nMS ",

            "Text": "I am with you for the most part as we have very similar paths. I disagree with you on the we still haven\u2019t found the bottom yet. But as you know these are just my thoughts and not predictive certainty. Because you could very well be correct. I am going the other direction because I see more enthusiasm amongst investors and more of them. When you and I were in the game early on we were surprised at how fast it had climbed in so little. My experience\u2019s with Mt Gox  I like everyone else sold and forgot about it. Luckily I started thinking about it when it was at 300 and said fuck it and bought in. As you know at that time there were even more uncertainty that it would just fade away and it very well could have. - but it didn\u2019t and we just held right on through it all. This time I believe it\u2019s different. I think alot of people are waking up to the reality of things like taxes and Governments around the world trying to wrap their arms around it causing much panic amongst the pump and dump institutional investors a recipe for the \u201cbubble\u201d that FUD news likes to latch onto. My gut says that we reached the bottom at 5.8-6 range and the floor is at 9k. Now, that is my thoughts- as one of us will be right as I very well could be wrong. Make no mistake I definitely have a cutoff as to when to sell and not look back. My fear is that these new investors are playing the very short term game and that will lead to your cesspool scenario and that could very well happen. So we\u2019ll see. I am very optimistic as there is more of a foundation, innovation,  interest and less availability than when it was when we were jumping out of the nest. Either way its the life of a bitcoiner we\u2019re up then we\u2019re down. We just have to play it out.",

Taking a sustained growth of 100% per year, which seems quite generous to me, this bubble will have to correct to $3k until the end of this year or $4k until the end of next year, not without taking a dip way below those values. \n\nThis doesn's mean the bubble isn't good for yet another bull trap this year. It doesn's even mean the last bull trap is over. \n\nOf course, I might be totally wrong. But this is my honest opinion.\n",

I\u2019m thinking about starting a cryptocurrency YouTube channel for investing tips.

As you know, there is already a joint Franco \u2013 German letter on this point.\n> \n> Crypto-asset markets are global, with worldwide transactions between investors, consumers and intermediaries.\n> \n> On its own, Europe represents only a small share of global cryptocurrency trading, so we need to work together with our partners in the G20 and international standard-setters.\n> \n> Today's roundtable focused on three main topics:\n> \n> the implications of crypto-currencies for financial markets,\n> \n> the risks and the opportunities associated with their use,\n> \n> and the recent development of Initial Coin Offerings.\n> \n> We concluded that:\n> \n> First, the blockchain technology holds strong promise for financial markets. To remain competitive, Europe must embrace this innovation.\n> \n> Second, crypto-currencies, which are not currencies in the traditional sense, and whose value is not guaranteed, have become subject of considerable speculation.\n> \n> This exposes consumers and investors to substantial risk including the risk to lose their investment.\n> \n> This is why our third conclusion is that warnings about these risks to consumers and investors are important: these must be clear, frequent, and across all jurisdictions.\n> \n> Fourth, Initial Coin Offerings have become a way for innovative firms in this field to raise substantial amounts of funding.\n> \n> This is an opportunity, but there are also problems that expose investors to substantial risk, such as the lack of transparency regarding the identity of the issuers and underlying business plans.\n> \n> Fifth, we need to assess further under what circumstances crypto-currencies and related services are covered by existing regulation.\n> \n> This depends very much on the facts and circumstances around specific crypto-tokens.\n> \n> Based on the assessment of risks and opportunities and the suitability of the existing regulatory framework for these instruments, the Commission will determine if regulatory action at EU level is required.\n> \n> Finally, crypto-assets present risks relating to money laundering and the financing of illicit activities.\n> \n> That is why the Commission proposed that virtual currency exchanges and wallet providers should be subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\n> \n> The co-legislators reached an agreement in December, and we invite Member States to prepare for a speedy transposition of this legislation.\n> \n> To sum up, the Commission will continue to monitor these markets together with other stakeholders, at EU and international level, including in the G20.\n> \n> We stand ready to take action based on an assessment of risks and opportunities.\n> \n> Following upcoming international discussions, we will decide on how to follow up today's roundtable.\n> \n> Thank you.\n\n",

So, the mere fact that the supply is caped is irrelevant; what matters is whether there will be enough suckers who believe in it that they will put in real money that others can take out (and say how they got rich off bitcoin).\n\nStore value!  Ask people who decided to store some value at the ATH last year how they feel right now about their stored value.  Cash-under-the-mattress would have been better!\n\nThe transaction speed is largely irrelevant because bitcoins are being used as gambling-pyramid-scam tokens, and not as currency that normal people regularly use for goods and services.

Truth is that throwing the price all over the place is one of the few attack vectors BTC has. But it doesent affect the underlying protocol and the price manipulators are not all powerful so overall the trend is up and hodlers will be fine. The larger the market gets and the more liquid, the more mature and more difficult it will be to throw the price around so no problem.",

Tesla wouldn\u2019t be worth diddly squat if people didn\u2019t believe in it but it is and it\u2019s changing the World. Bitcoin is the pioneer of digital currency and its already changed the world has it not? Will it hold 1st place- maybe -maybe not. It is a store of value, you can trade it and people are willing to buy into it and its worldwide. People are paying to much to the peak and saying \ud83d\ude31 and hoping and praying that it will go back up so they can recoup their money. Then they look at the exchange every second and freak out thinking its going to tank again. Theres the other half that are waiting for it to drop to buy in. Being that there is a limited quantity and that theres an interest worldwide to keep it alive. How can it fail? BTC will likely succeed in the long term. HODL or sell are both equally important and open your eyes because its worth 10k right now and people are waking up to the fact that it is here to stay and are willing to take a chance to invest in it. The getting rich overnight days are over but the long term looks bright.",

            "Text": "What now?  Look, when people invest in the stocks of a serious company, there is something solid there, share prices and dividends pour in when the company produces goods and services that people are keen to pay for.   With bitcoin and other cryptos, everything is about empty air, and money is made only from greedy suckers who pile in as the prices rise.   So how do we get enough incoming greedy suckers (what some people here call \"new money\")?   \n\n\nSaid suckers can come in on their own, e.g after hearing wild stories if new mansions and lambos, or they must be encouraged.   The encouragement might be in the form of extensive hype in all sorts of media, or it might have to be more robust (e.g. pumping).    Key point to keep in mind is that the pumpers and the suckers are actually in agreement: that is, it is a dubious activity, but we'll make our money and pass it on.\n\nSo, to answer your question, \"happy\" is not the word I would use, but I am OK with it; it;s how these crypto things work.    Nobody will make any money unless some clueless types keep coming in.   Should I be sensitive about the clueless types?  Not really.  Other than than the obvious warning signs, regulators, banks, governments etc. keep warning them, but they won't stop.   Some banks have even had to try and instill a bit of discipline by curtailing wild spending on credit cards, but the lemmings still keep rushing forward!\n\nTether/Bitfinex are a scam, although with careful trading they could collect the money they claim they have had all along.    Do I care that they are scam artists?   Not really.  As far as I can tell, nothing will stop the rush of greed all over the place.   And all the info on Tether/Bitfinex and other pump-and-dump types is out there for anyone who cares enough to do his homework.  Right now we are in a cyclic pump-and-dump scheme around $10K.  Why is it working?   Because new suckers keep coming in, no matter what.   Should I be concerned about that?   I don't see why I should.  ",

At some points it felt like it was definitely heading down to zero.  When you can feel despair from just checking the price a couple of times a week, THAT was what a bear market bottom felt like.\n\nA long term investor buys when there's blood in the streets.  The sentiment now is anything but despair and hopeless.  On a mere 6% pop there are all these beginners FOMOing and cheering non-stop and ready to declare victory.  From experience this means we're nowhere near a bottom.\n\nLong term I remain bullish on the technology, just not bullish at all on this grossly inflated price.  IMO bitcoin will survive and thrive again and probably make news ATHs eventually, even if it falls to $600 again. \n\nThere are no financial instruments that are buys at any price.  When valuation is sky high it means the market has run far ahead of fundamentals and priced in a perfect scenario.  Reality rarely turns out perfect.  This principle applies to stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate too, not just cryptos.",

Would definitely scare away the sheeple to be be fleeced.   Even just \"well above near-nothing\" would not be good enough.   Think about this: middle of last year $4K would have been considered great.   Now, after the mad rush of the autumn?   A total disaster.    Lessons have been learned from the dip to $6K.\n\n\n\nThe lemmings, if their attention is to be maintained, cannot handle any huge drops any time soon.   Things have to be steady for a while, and never near-zero (total death!).   I like the current steady oscillation up and down around $10K; anyone who grew up on a farm will tell you about the \"gentle\" tricks in luring a chicken or whatever to be slaughtered for a Big Dinner.    Maintain that for a while, and then it will definitely be time to clean up with a \"big tech announcement\".   Key: steady around $10K for some time and then a \"major announcement\" is more credible; slip to near-zero, and they are all gone after losing all their lunch money.   \n\n\n\nThis thing is now like a religion to some.

But as you know these are just my thoughts and not predictive certainty. Because you could very well be correct. I am going the other direction because I see more enthusiasm amongst investors and more of them. When you and I were in the game early on we were surprised at how fast it had climbed in so little. My experience\u2019s with Mt Gox  I like everyone else sold and forgot about it. Luckily I started thinking about it when it was at 300 and said fuck it and bought in. As you know at that time there were even more uncertainty that it would just fade away and it very well could have. - but it didn\u2019t and we just held right on through it all. This time I believe it\u2019s different. I think alot of people are waking up to the reality of things like taxes and Governments around the world trying to wrap their arms around it causing much panic amongst the pump and dump institutional investors a recipe for the \u201cbubble\u201d that FUD news likes to latch onto. My gut says that we reached the bottom at 5.8-6 range and the floor is at 9k. Now, that is my thoughts- as one of us will be right as I very well could be wrong. Make no mistake I definitely have a cutoff as to when to sell and not look back. My fear is that these new investors are playing the very short term game and that will lead to your cesspool scenario and that could very well happen. So we\u2019ll see. I am very optimistic as there is more of a foundation, innovation,  interest and less availability than when it was when we were jumping out of the nest. Either way its the life of a bitcoiner we\u2019re up then we\u2019re down. We just have to play it out.",

This is not ideal for them, but their money was also gathered illicitly so who cares.\n\nNobody stores large amounts of value in _USD_. People do store value in inflation protected cash equivalents \n\nBuying stocks/bonds is not limited to the wealthy. Anyone who spends 5 minutes on Google, prepares a tax return (you can receive your refund in bonds), or walks into a bank can easily start a retirement account. \n\nHell, if you\u2019re _only_ interested in combating inflation go to treasury direct.com and buy an i savings bond.
