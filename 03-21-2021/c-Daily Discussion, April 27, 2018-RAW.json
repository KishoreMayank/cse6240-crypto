Could be interesting. If 9.2k holds, possibly a good sign, if it doesn't, back to 8.8k perhaps.\n\n[EDIT] I know that some bulls out there have been doing great. If it turns out that you don't have sufficient backing at 9.2k then that's not your fault. If you get backing, then let's hope that backing sticks for a while. The sell pressure has been a bit hard lately at these levels.",

Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/\n\nHaving recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.\n\nThe cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).\n\nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.\n\nA bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.\n\nView **The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**",

            "Text": "Exposure is exposure. The margin is simply how much money you have to open the trade.  So in your example you have either $50 000 or $20 000 to trade. $10 000 x 5 leverage or $10 000 x 2 leverage.\n\nHow much of that you use \\(your exposure\\) determines your profits or losses. The temptation is always to put down a bigger position, so you only have $10k of your own funds, but you can put down $25k \\(this is your exposure\\) on a position and incur profits and losses of the $25k position, not the $10k you have.\n\nYou have to be extremely careful with margin on Crypto's. These things lose up to 50&#37; or gain up to 100&#37; in a few hours. So lets say you chose to go 5:1 and put down $25 000 on a short and Bitcoin doubles. You'll lose your account and then some. In fact it will be a loss of \\-$12 500 and you only have a $10 000 account.\n\nThe correct use of margin is actually to reduce broker or third party exposure. So instead of depositing $10 000 with your broker, you only deposit $2000. But with the margin you still have $10 000 to trade. That way if the broker folds you still have 80&#37; of your money left. If your position gets into trouble you can bail yourself temporarily and remove the money again when the crises is over.  This reduces the amount of time your money is exposed to a third party's risk.\n\nHope that helps and made it a bit clearer.",

That's still a ways away, we need more channels open, more nodes, and more liquidity available. That will come with time as the applications that use LN and make it more accessible to users are developed, and as more stores start accepting it. There's a network effect with LN where we need to reach larger adoption before it really becomes useful. When it does, it will start chewing away at on\\-chain transaction fees since a lot will be off\\-chain. Until then, help support LN and persuade vendors to support it :\\)",

            "Text": "> You have to be extremely careful with margin on Crypto's. These things lose up to 50% or gain up to 100% in a few hours. So lets say you chose to go 5:1 and put down $25 000 on a short and Bitcoin doubles. You'll lose your account and then some. In fact it will be a loss of -$12 500 and you only have a $10 000 account.\n\n\nThe part I don't get is the leveraging. Just to follow your example, let's say I borrow 25k USD and open a short when BTC hits the price of 10k USD. With a leverage of 5:1 would't my margin of 10k USD get liquidated *way* before the price of BTC hit 20k USD? The math behind leveraging gets me confused :s",

It\u2019s crazy. I wish my generation and up were smart enough to realize that we need adoption now or we ourselves wont enjoy the freedom it brings. It\u2019s mind numbing why bitcoin supports aren\u2019t as passionate for adoption as the scam artist Ver is passionate scamming people. I hate the man. He stole money from me and my family with his bait and switch but I like his passion that he knows we need adoption now, not later. ",

A $10k position short at 5:1 will give you exactly the same losses as a $10k position at 1:1. \n\nA $10k position is $10k regardless of  your leverage and will incur the same loss or profit at 5:1, 3:1 or 1:1. $10k is $10k.  \n\nThe broker will margin call you when their requirements are no longer met. So $25k position at 50% loss would be -$12.5. You only had $10k, so yes, account is gone.  ",
