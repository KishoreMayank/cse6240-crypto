Before the price started it's insane exponential unnatural rise, we were sitting at about $3k (already up from $1k from just a few months before). \n\nIt started to double fairly quickly at a faster rate than usual, and reached $6k. This was due to very positive outlook and the great potential in the long run. Then it hit $8k. At that point, justifying that price was becoming a bit of a stretch, but you could make the argument that Bitcoin had a really bright future and huge potential. \n\nWhen it went above that, that became just insanity, and it was hard to find logic and reason for the rise anymore and for that high a price. There was no change in the technology, or usage. \n\nSo really $6-8K is a very reasonable price, it's where we were before we lost reason and logic, and this is where we are back now, because that's really where Bitcoin should be",

I own both, and each are excellent in their own way. \n From what I can tell, both Ledger Nano S and the Trezor wallet were about even, given that the differences between the two were; \n\n* Nano S used security hardened chips\n* Trezor is open source  \n\nLedger seemed to be the king given the lower price, however now you can pickup a Trezor for cheaper.  Personally I prefer the Open Source nature of the Trezor, given that both support passphrase encrypted seeds, it doesn't matter that someone could theoretically retrieve the seed from the device.  On the Trezor I can verify this is true through reviewing the code, however I can't verify that the Ledger isn't storing the passphrase to an encrypted seed.",

Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.\n\nAsset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.\n\n\"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase\" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.\n\nInvsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.\n\nIt remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed \"dozens\" of investigations were underway.\n\nThe other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.\n\nThese factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.\n\nEnneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in \"BTC dominance\" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.\n\nWhile the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.\n\nThe combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.",

And am still struggling to see it's place or usecase. Not only does everything we have right now seem to be better, but also any technological breakthrough \"our\" engineers might ever come up with, seems to me to way better serve the current system rather than bitcoin. I genuinely feel the talent we have rn  developing \"decentralized\" projects is being wasted (not to mention manipulated by conmen). Socially ppl need not only a central point of control, but also a central point of trust.  Can you, r/bitcoin, honestly say you'd rather trust no one for better or for worse and take matter into your own hands win or lose?",

            "Text": "Since early March, there has been decreasing fluctuation between peaks and valleys.  Also, the amount of time between peaks and valleys has been decreasing.  This, combined with the obvious downward trend suggests an underlying psychological phenomenon on the part of the day traders:  They're increasingly competing with each other, and not market as a whole.  Each pump might be correlated with an external event, such as regulation changes, etc.  Once the pump gets going, the day traders dump increasingly more easily, willing to avoid coming too close to the next peak.  This is what's causing the increasingly rapid cycling between the peaks and valleys.  At this point, the only thing that will cause a meaningful bull run is a massive and sustained investment by whales.  The thing about whales is, they tend to be conservative investors.  So, this massive bull run won't start until the price gets to about 2K.  Sure, there could be a \"teaser\" bull run at 4k, pumping us to over 10k, but this won't last.  Not until big money gets infused at 2K will the current 2018 cycle be broken.",

Bitcoin is priced on its worth like anything, it was worth more a few months ago because more people invested in it and more money flowed in.

            "Text": "Well, the article makes some assumptions without making it clear that they are assumptions, or justifying those assumptions.\n\nFor instance, it talks about governments using the banks to deal with things like the financial crash on 2008. But that financial crash was caused by the banks in the first place, precisely because banks can in effect create money, which is what they did in the sub-prime lending crisis. So, perhaps, if the banks went away, then so would that problem.\n\nSecond, it assumes that people will hold Bitcoin (or whatever) because they think it will increase in value. But that assumes that Bitcoin does increase in value, which, in the long term, it can't (sure, it could rise much higher, but there is a limit).\n\nThird, it suggests that there are just too many different coins to be usable. But that is an assumption that because there are currently lots of coins, there will always be lots of coins; it is just as possible that as the ecosystem matures, the number of coins will reduce.\n\nSo, I have no idea whether Bitcoin (or whatever) will or will not replace fiat, but the article is just noise without any recognition, leet alone justification, of the assumptions on which it is based.",

            "Text": "By selling them in the future. The mechanics behind it is this: Bitcoin\u2019s current value is $7k. You promise to sell me 1 bitcoin in a week\u2019s time for $7k. Thing is, you don\u2019t actually own any bitcoin at the moment. \n\nOne week later you buy a bitcoin, and you sell it to me for $7k as promised. Let\u2019s look at two scenarios one week after we formed our agreement.\n\n1) the bitcoin price is $6k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You\u2019ve just made $1k.\n\n2) the bitcoin price is $8k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You\u2019ve just lost $1k.\n\nThe effect is the same as if you had held negative 1 bitcoin from day 0 and sold it on day 7.\n\nThe risky thing with selling futures is that there\u2019s no limit to how much you can lose. You know how people say \u201conly invest what you can afford to lose\u201d, you can\u2019t do that if you short. If in a week\u2019s time bitcoin\u2019s price is $20k, you lose $13k. If the price is $100k you lose $93k. If you don\u2019t have the money you declare yourself bankrupt. \n\nAs a completely independent person with nothing at stake, I would advise against shorting such a volatile asset.",

I suppose we could spend all day arguing for or against. \n\nBut ask yourself this Aulne, where would humanity be right now if we never tried anything new? Where would we be if never tried to innovate, never pushed forward towards a dream, no matter how misguided. Where would the world be if nobody ever tried because their attempts may fail? \n\nYou say a centralized point of authority is mandatory because that's the way things have always been. But what stops that authority from abusing their position? History as well as science has shown us that humanity is largely incapable of governing itself successfully, without compromise, and without corruption.\n\nA trustless based system rooted in machines is simply a new way of addressing an old problem. Why should we not see this trough? Because we may end up losing some petty, meaningless currency? Well that is a risk I am willing to take Aulne. ",

That's my premise)\n\nThis is the true reason I believe in supporting bitcoin so adamantly. not because I think it is the answer, but becuse it serves as a proof of concept. proof that we can have a system where trust is irrelevant because save for the exception of a hack (nothing is perfect) the system itself dissolves that requirement, by creating a lack of incentive to do so.\n\nmoney makes the world turn as the saying goes. well if we can have a decentralized currency, than that proves we can have a decentralized government where no one entity is in charge. A truly free institution run by the people, all people, for the people.\n\nof course we are still a far ways off, but computers do as they are told and have nothing to gain. its also worth noting that the AI sentience problem is irrelevant in the main system as one would only need that for judgement and not function.\n\nThe only real concern here is that a human will still need the write the initial code. that one in a billion person, truly pure and free of corruption. without that special enlightened individual the whole game would be rigged from the start. but, no matter how rare, now we just need one exceptional being to free us from ourselves instead of relying on millions.\n\nTLDR; I don't actually believe in bitcoin so much as I do the idea and the possibilities it represents.\n\nEdit: fixed numerous grammatical and spelling errors. the high dose of Modafinil is kicking in now so my IQ has effectively halved. lol",

So if I go to a store and want to purchase something how does the person know that I have the funds to cover my purchase? They dont call the bank and say hey does he have money in his account. It is all numbers. in the 1800 gold was worth $19 an ounce now its a little over a $1000 why is gold so high? Who knows. But just because you dont believe something is worth a certain prices doesnt mean its not. Crypto are the future and if you don't think so we you are in bad shape. If you think about it debit cards are backed by money, gold is backed by money cryptos are backed by money. But bitcoin is putting the power back in the peoples had. I just traded a few coins and made a little profit but the banks do the same thing with your money and they keep all the profits how is that fair. Bitcoin and cryptos are the future embrace it change is good.",

With summer coming, I will have to spend energy on cooling, though that should be fully covered by the solar array too. I was fortunate enough to recoup costs for equipment during the ATH.

So hidden costs are really just racks, sub panels and circuit breakers, conduit (expensive) and outlets. Also cooling.\n\nMining is essentially investing, there is a risk based on speculation. When price goes up, your profits go up, especially if you hold.\n\nBut difficulty is the real concern, if difficulty is skyrocketing the whole time, you may find that even with moon prices, you would have been more profitable buying. But it could just as well go the other way. - we won't know till it happens.\n\nHowever, markets do have to follow some rules to some extent or they would collapse and we inadvertently dictate this. Like miners not introducing any more new coins until the price is desirable.\n \nso the odds will always be that mining will be slightly more profitable than investing in the long term if you hold profits and only sell to cover costs.
