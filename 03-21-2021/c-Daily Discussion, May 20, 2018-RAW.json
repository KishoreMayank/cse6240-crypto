But I\u2019m confused why if lots of people think that Crypto is going to shit and the bear market will last for who knows how long then why are we or I reading about these institutions and exchanges scaling up and expecting high volumes in the future. I keep reading Coinbase is scaling up. Goldman, JP. Why do all this if it\u2019s bullshit? Thanks for helping!!! ",

To sustain a steady price or increase the price that shortfall must be made up by new investors and old investors adding to their positions. The motivation for bitcoin buyers without a practical need is that the practical demand will soon overwhelm the amount of bitcoins available leading to a great appreciation in price. A large practical demand for bitcoin is a few years off so now any rise in price reflects the success the pro-bitcoin media is having selling the narrative to ordinary investors.",

When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle",
