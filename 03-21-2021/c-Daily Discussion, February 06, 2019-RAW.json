We all need to keep this in perspective. Understand that this whole thing has been reining back to a reasonable point where it could then easily continue on its climb. If you're averaging in to accumulate and you're not in a rush or delusional in some hope to become a millionaire overnight, then this is actually a positive thing. Because if you recall, there was very little time to grab bitcoin when the price was skyrocketing so fast in Dec 2017. Slow and steady always wins.",

I'm not famillear with the jargon so bear with me.. \n\nShe has \"invested\" in a \"bitcoin mining\" (pool?). This is the second one. The first was an obvious scam, lady said she was from RBS and \"going through a divorce\" my mom \"invested\" some money which somehow turned into 40k.. when my mom went to try and retrieve her money BOA and her long time local banks shut down her accounts because they assumed the money was from \"drugs\" or something.. so my mom started sending the \"RBS\" lady itunes cards and shit. 300$ at a time. When my mom said enough was enough, the lady began pressuring my aunt to lend my mom money and when she wouldn't began telling my mom my Aunt and all her kids had abandoned her. My mom caught on after that and told the Ben lady to shove it. \n\nSo she invested in this other, which my bitcoin savvy brother approved.. she began with 50$ and it either turned into 1,700 or 17,000 not sure which. Now they aparently deposited her investment in a credit union which isn't far from where I live, and she bought a \"bitcoin key\" to get her money and they want to \"charge her 3k\" for taxes up front (not take 3k out of her profits like say, fiedility would do if I tapped my 401k early) \n\nThey don't want her traveling to the bank to pull the money out cash and won't send her a check or deposit it into her account. \n\nWhat the hell is going on? How should this process typically work? Can anyone help me understand so I can help her :/ \n\nEdit: got a few answers! \n\nScam #1 the woman contacted her through facebook. No mutual friends. I read her the riot act about accepting friend requests from people she doesn't know especially with having her grandkids pictures posted up there. Think MLM style \"hey hon\" message. \n\nScam #2- she was given the info from her Cousin.\n\nMy brothers approval goes as far as her verbally telling him the companies, and him looking them up and them appearing legit. He has not endorsed this. \n\nScam #1 lady contacted my mom this afternoon and is trying to \"show my mom\" her money is in a bank account or some shit. I told my mom she needs to make it clear to this woman she's not getting any money whatsoever.\n\n If you guys want more updates that's cool- but you all have been very helpful so far, many thanks. I may not be able to save her from Amway, but maaaaaybe we can save her from Bitcoin scams! \n\n",

            "Text": "(nobody has to read this - if you have time on your hands and have concerns about what's happening around the globe with central banks 'printing' out their currency expontentially the past decade then you can read this if you want)\n\n\nI've been studying for a while now what's happening with the US dollar on the world stage. Countries like Russia, India, China, Iran, South Africa and a several other countries no longer have faith in the US dollar as our Fed reserve creates trillions of dollars out of nothing and they all think it's going to crash. So they are going with mutual trade agreements and many nations are repatriating their gold reserves and so on (not going to write a book on this but.....) \n\nAnyhow people can take many hours and study all of this for themselves - if anyone expresses interest I can give them a few rabbit holes to go down to research all of this.\n\nBut I'd just like to summarize what I think might be a good idea....\n\nIt's not just slightly possible, but it's likely that the US dollar is going to lose the confidence that keeps it retaining it's every value (dropped by 95% in purchasing power in just over 100 years) based on a bunch of reasons all the things the FED and US gov has done to come to the rescue are no longer available - example interest rate is already near zero... they can't lower interest rates below zero) many other things that they used to have at their disposal they no longer have. So when it crashes it's going to crash very hard and possibly for good. The US dollar could quite literally be worth 0... and it could happen in the next 2-5 years. It may not of course - but I believe based on all I've read it's entirely possible.\n\n\nYou can take time and research all of this...\n\nbut I'm just going to put some suggestions out there for you to take or leave - I'm not a financial expert\n\nAnyhow If I had money in the bank for now I wouldn't keep it there... (pay all your bills 3 months in advance or more and then decide what to do with the rest....) \n\nHonestly the stock market bubble IS going to burst... it might not happen for a year or two... maybe longer but it will happen.  \n\nFor now with what I believe is very likely to happen - I'd sell some of my 'toys' that I really can live without for a few years or longer (I can always buy them back later if things don't go south)\n\nI'd use my excess savings, the money I make from my toys (and a few other things I'd also do)\n\nand here is what I would do with that money....\n\nwith all my bills paid 3 months in advanced and a small bit of cash... I'd take the rest and protect myself from what could likely be a 5-10 year very very hard time in MOST of the global economy \n\nLet's say after all is said and done I have $20,000 (just using this cause it's easy to do math on)\n\n\nI would put 10-20% into industrial grade jewelry (at least 90% pure gold) \n\nKnowing how often gov's have confiscated gold (and this time you won't be getting '$' for that gold should your gov do this) I might consider putting 10% into gold coins, or perhaps not.\n\nI'd put 20-30% into silver coins, and some silver bars... (there's a massive massive amount of gold in reserves, not nearly as much silver and silver is valuable and needed in industry)\n\nDepending on my experience and faith in Crypto I'd decide a % to invest in Crypto perhaps 10-20% or more.... once the Central banking systems collapse, they are going to have to come up with a new monetary system. While Crypto isn't ready yet - it's possibly the most ready of anything governments and the global economy has to use. While there may likely be a secret plan (or even one non secret that most don't know about) already in place that big banks and the elite controlling eveything have planned. That I am not aware of.\n\n\nSince Bitcoin is the most established - and if it is being forced to be spent not just saved - it might be the primary crypto in a new global economy. But I am not for putting all my eggs in one basket - so I'd put 1/3 into Bitcoin, and then 1/3 each into two others that are pretty established that might also end up being the new 'currency' or 'money' I won't name the two I'd choose however - because I could be totally wrong and wouldn't want someone to invest real $ in them based on my gut instinct only.\n\nSo all together the $ I invest in the above things to protect myself in case the US Dollar collapses and with it much of the tied in global economy... that's between 60-70% of the total\n\nthe other 30% I'd put into other assets, small but tradeable required goods - perhaps look into the 'doomsday/prepper' sites and at least get some ideas from there... they've spent years obsessing over what to do in case of something like this so will save you some time.\n\n\nAnyhow - if bitcoin or another crypto (or more than one) does end up being the solution that governments turn to in some form - the price may not \"moon' (since it will be being spent NOT horded) but it would very likely to go up considerably in price...That's what I think - but I could be very wrong.\n\nThis is not investment advice really - just sharing what I would do.... if you are investing a considerable amount of money into the above things - you'd obvoiously want to spend quite a bit of time looking into this and see if you end up believing as I do or if you decide 'the US dollar can't fail they can just keep printing more' - or 'our economy has crashed many times and we've done fine' (this time is very very very different for many reasons)\n\nGood luck in your future!\n\nbtw -  other than the crypto suggestion - the rest of the $ you spend - you WILL make money on in the long run no matter what. (If you buy assets/goods to use/trade and you things end up fine you can use them or donate them to the needy) and be aware there's manipulation in the silver market - if it does drop - just hang on to it, it will go back up in time.\n",

            "Text": "If only there was some way to stop things like the QuadrigaCX tragedy/exitscam from happening. Like a second layer solution or something that somehow (trustlessly) verified that big exchange vendors actually had (in designated/broadcast \"server\" wallets) the amount of funds = to that which user's (client wallets) had deposited into it. In theory this is simple maths, but it could also a fail safe in case either dodgy exchanges or hackers tried to steal out all the coins. Perhaps it could also check if a wallet is multisig or in danger of one person stealing all the coins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know about you guys, but I want Joe public to be excited about bitcoin. At the minute hacks and exitscams are voiding a lot of public confidence, from those that don't \"get\" the technology. I admit it was several months after I had had large sums stuck on coinbase, that I actually learned enough about the technology to know that was not a good idea. I'm not blowing my own trumpet to say I'm one of the most maths and tech-savvy people I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess any such solution would require time to make, and also likely to remain honest would have to use a decentralised algorithm, and require computation power. There would also have to be incentives, just like block rewards, and someone would have to foot the bill. Would YOU be willing to donate a few mBTC willingly, each year, to keep the big exchanges with their easy to use interfaces honest? I know I would!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course the solution is \"not your keys, not your bitcoin\", but each Joe Public has to learn that, and how many months, or years, might that take? Might the lesson only be learned after Joe loses coins due to a hack/exit scam? He might not return to the cryptosphere after such an event and may badmouth bitcoin as a scam to all his friends, in simple ignorance. I feel it's probably a speedier way to mainstream adoption nirvana if we can prevent/limit the hacks/exitscams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also know I am a shit programmer. \n\nSatoshi, give us your guidance!",

The trend is still intact and we are just looking for a good price where technicals are over extended to the downside (just like they were over extended to the upside - 20k) and the fundamentals keep growing and evolving but price keeps going down. This is where the divergence happens and the trend shifts. I have no idea when price will be over extended to the downside and I'm not in the business of predicting. But having traded the equity markets for 11 years, one thing I know is the maximum amount of people need to feel the pain to cause capitulation at a price that seems unfathomably low then we can start creating the bottom.

I can google them but I myself would not be able to tell a legitimate \"mining\" operation/site from an illegitimate one. Her cousin told her this morning that the 3k #2 wants is to transfer the money from china (yen, I assune) to USD and I think she said it was an ATF fee?

            "Text": "The example I like to use is like designer clothing. You can buy a Prada handbag for $3,500 or you can buy the Chinese knockoff for $100. That's a pretty easy way to explain Bitcoin cash I find with most people. \n\nAs for the cost, let me break that down. Is it cheaper for them to prop the value up as more people get out of it or if you are coins are in float? Yes but there is a huge caveat. We cannot only see how many transactions are in each block but it still costs them all that electricity in mining so if people aren't actually buying the coins and they are just selling them to themselves they are burning up countless dollars and electricity and miners to keep the network going. The real clue is going to be with network transactions and they are pretty damn low. This would actually be the textbook perfect capitulation. If Bitcoin cash or bitmain goes down and fails there's going to be a lot of crypto put on the market. Litecoin might go to single digits. Bitcoin might briefly dip under 2,000. It would be the most glorious time ever because you would create an actual bottom and have a lot of optimism afterwards. Bitcoin cash would be destroyed. There would be no more overhead or worry and you would break some of the most toxic players. For people who actually believe in the future of Bitcoin it would be a Black Friday sale and not likely to last long",
