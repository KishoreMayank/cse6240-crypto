Or, the market is consolidating in preparation to breakout and resume the move higher.\n\nTaking out 8950 (Coinbase) and 9000 (Bitfinex) to the upside would confirm the rally is resuming.\n\nHowever for now, weakening price action appears to be favoring a retracement. A typical retracement ought to be around 50% which is at 7482 (Coinbase) and 7538 (Bitfinex).\nAt 7599 (Bitfinex), represents 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire Bitcoin market.\n\nGiven the aforementioned criteria, the following short position has been ordered:\n\nBTC/USD (COINBASE)\n\nOPEN: 8600\n\nCLOSE: 7482\n\nSTOP: 8950\n\nRISK: 4%\n\nREWARD: 13%\n\nAfterwards, the expectation would be for the market to resume the Primary degree b-wave bounce, which may retrace up to 38.2% of the Primary a-wave decline which began on 06-JAN-2018.\nThe following Fibonacci levels may serve as target areas of where the rally may conclude towards the psychological 10000 level, Bitfinex prices:\n\n1. 9350: approx previous line of support/resistance.\n2. 9946: 50% Fibonacci retracement level of entire Bitcoin market.\n3. 10298: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the decline which began on 06-JAN-2018\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LgdJaSX.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YL7d6Fh.png\n\n",

            "Text": "what an interesting (rip off) experience. I just purchased some bitcoin via bitcoin atm. It was nerve wracking because I was afraid I would make an irreversible mistake. Not only were the fees high but the exchange rate was at 10k instead of 8.5k or abouts. The atm normally scans phone based QR codes but for some reason my phone would not scan so I instead went with a paper wallet option. I first tried a small amount for the first transaction, once successfully completed I went ahead and completed a second one with more cash. The fees were sky high. 30 bucks to buy 300 USD of BTC! I can't possibly see how the average person would even want to use one of these machines. I normally buy from coinbase but I had some cash on hand and I wanted to learn more about one touch point in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ",

If Putin is paying off Trump, couldn't he be doing it in bitcoin?  We saw a crash just a little while after Putin announced candidacy for president.  Couldn't they be selling their coins after the major transactions have concluded?",

            "Text": "This is a key concept that I dont think a pot of people understand (judging from comments).\n\nExchanges are double auction markets. That is, buyers submit bids and sellers submit asks, which get listed on the market. If you want to buy at 'market price' that means you accept the sellers' lowest ask. A transaction happens. Vice versa with selling: you take the highest bid. Once that bid gets exhausted, the next highest bid comes into play. \n\nExchanges actually report an aggregate of transaction prices. Price action represents traders charging through bids or asks, pushing market prices. \n\nThe 'spread' is the difference between bid and ask. There's always a spread. If bids and asks converge they turn into transactions and get cleared. \n\nIf you don't like the market price, place a limit order, which will end up in either the bids or asks, and will stay there until it gets taken by another participant. \n\nMarket makers can profit from large spreads by entering bids/asks that are narrower than the spread. This isn't how exchanges make money, though. They charge transaction fees of some form. Profiting off of spreads and charging transaction fees may be related but are distinct. \n\nHopefully helpful.

Gemini and most other exchanges only charge a fee, but coinbase rips you off with both a high fee and a high spread.  Best to get out of them if you can.  There is always some spread but this is NOT the buy sell spread as mentioned in another comment, it is just profit taking by coinbase.  In the backend they just pocket the difference between the published rate and the buy sell rate.",

Or, you can purchase right now at the current price + markup + fees, and then wait a week for the transaction to clear. I personally will just pay the fees, and figure it into my dollar cost average. The price moves so much, that by the time my cash deposit clears and I make a purchase, the price will have gone up $1000+. Even with the fees, it is in my best interest to just buy it now while the price is low. ",

            "Text": "coinbase takes 1.5% fee on top of either side of the spot quote.  \n\nIf spot price is 8500:\n\nCoinbase listed buy price is going to be 8500 times 1.015 = 8627.5.   \nSell side is 8500 times .985=8372.5.   \n\nNormally the spot price is fluctuating so you will see these prices move up or down so you never get a clear picture of this spread (it could widen or close depending on the order you look at the prices sell-buy, buy-sell and whether the spot market is moving up or down between the times of checking).\n\nIf you use an exchange.  Say gdax which is run by coinbase.  The fee structure is different.  0% fees if you are a market maker (i.e. you post a limit order that is filled by a market order) and starts at .25% and goes down to as low as .1% based on your 30day volume if you are making a market order.\n\nClearly you save 1.25% if you open a gdax account and use that to buy/sell vs. using Coinbase.\n\nAsk why ?  Because Coinbase is designed to make buying and selling 'easy' for noobs and gdax is for traders and requires somewhat more sophistication to use.    Coinbase has good reason not to let you know that you could just sign up for gdax and save yourself the 1.25% on the fees since they get AT BEST 1/12th the fees for the same amount of crypto changing hands on a gdax trade vs. a coinbase one when you work out the details and do the math.",

There were no memes back then but plenty of talk about lambos.\n\nThen the next wave of the bear market hit and these stocks went down another 85-99%. Most bottomed around 1 to 1.5 years later.

All Lightning Network nodes are connected together in a big network so payments can be sent via intermediaries, that way users only need three or four active payment channels (or tubes) to be able to transact with anybody on the lightning network. The bitcoins follow little programs called smart contracts which mean that nobody except the rightful owner of the bitcoins can transact with them. Lightning Network is a more efficient way of using bitcoin because payments will be routed through a small number of nodes, instead of being broadcast to every single bitcoin full node and miner.",

That said, there's a premium for anonymity (useless for me but hey whatever). If the perfect conditions existed and it reached equalibrium, imho it would reach it at a much higher price (like 100k or something). Only because of the fact that if every millionaire wanted one, they couldn't get one. I sold a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle for 1200 bucks for the same reason. At that point though, like usd/euro it would only be worth it to investors at really high dollar amounts bc the fluctuation would be very small. That is looking at it as a complete currency, which it's really not. More like using gold as currency and a store of value. At that point, I think it would still be a good investment. I REALLY want to use btc to buy a house. It's an interesting situation bc its considered property by \"you know who\". If I traded property that was worth 100k for another that's worth 100k or 500k, if you live there for 3 out of 5 years, you do not have to pay tax on the sale of the house.",

            "Text": "It's illogical to buy anything in bitcoin right now due to slow speeds and large fees. Once these are ironed out it'll make more sense. The reality is that merchants will only start offering cryptos as a form of payment once it makes financial sense. Why would they go through the hassle when very few would be interested? I believe once fees are low enough and transaction times are virtually instant then merchants will start to adopt. It seems like a win win for merchants as it means no fees for them to pay and no risk of fraudulent chargebacks/disputes.",

I started going there around 1992 on sales and support calls.  They were a huge customer,  you become friends with your contacts,  and we'd end up drinking Friday nights at the Sagebrush Cantina.

It enables instant transactions between participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of digital cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds or trust to third parties.\n\nNormal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant blockchain, followed by making any number of Lightning transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting to the blockchain, followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the transaction to distribute the channel's funds.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Right now more BTC is being sold in smaller quantities. You know what that tells me? Ordinary people are investing in bitcoin- not only are ordinary people investing there\u2019s a little more than a few of the so called whales. The more bitcoin becomes diversified the more stable it will be. Bitcoin is a ground up platform and it will succeed. Anyways, I\u2019m tired. One of us will be right guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Have a good night.",

Which is fine - some poker pros made millions in the online poker craze just a few years ago, so a casino game can be very profitable to some players, and there are skills which allow poker pros to have an edge vs other players. However, Hold'em is not an asset.",
