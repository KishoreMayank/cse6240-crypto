Coinbase has a limited amount of coins, but if you want to diversify you\u2019ll need to move onto another exchange such as Binance. \nThe reason for making the Coinbase account is because Binance doesn\u2019t let you trade fiat for coins, you can only deposit crypto. This is why Coinbase is used, to buy some initial Bitcoin that you can then transfer onto Binance. Binance has a huge list of altcoins to choose from, and a very small fee (0.1%) which is even less if you use their Binance Coin (BNB) to pay for fees. \n\nIf you have any questions, ask away. I\u2019ll try to answer relatively quickly. ",

This way, you won't have put all your money in one price that could still drop. Also, if you buy in intervals you will have bought some at the lowest price and begin making gains on that buy as soon as the price recovers. This market is volatile and can move fast. Most selling seems to have been done, and it 'appears' we may be headed up going forward, but there is zero guarantee.  One would think that anyone who was going to sell a large amount would have done so by now but anything can happen.",

Think about video conferencing, like cam services, where you load your channel and pay for each second you are viewing without having to trust the counterparty with your remaining funds. The same could be done for telephone services that charge by the minute. I have heard about a project that uses LN to provide access to public wi-fi hotspots.\n\nBut as for building an internet service on top of LN, I don't think that's very practical, because you need to already have internet before you can use LN. It's sort of like asking if you can build a highway to go on top of a car, rather than building a car to go on a highway.",

It is in direct competition with Twitter and has the potential to be a real competitor. It has many users that are banned from other networks because reasons and feelings.*\n\n*It\u2019s owners love bitcoin. Endlessly promoting it on social networks.*\n\n*They love it as they know the powers that be cannot control it like they do with freedom of speech.*\n\n*My thoughts \u2013 can we somehow get Gab to implement a Lightning Network tip bot on the site? Anyone in the know of how this could work needs to contact Gab and see if they can work it up together.*\n\n*If all users were given a certain amount of Satoshi\u2019s it can be used instead of the \u201cLike\u201d button and I should imagine it would go viral and be very popular. Other competitors (Twitter/Facebook), might also not want to be left behind in the \u201ccontent wars\u201d.*",

They also have an app of course and if you're looking to purchase a wide variety of alt coins, then just buy Bitcoin or Eth from Coinbase, send it to Binance and then exchange for the alt coins of your choice. Binance is the best choice for alts and you can't buy them directly with USD, which is why you need to purchase them with BTC or ETH. It might seem confusing at first but once you do it a few times it will make a lot more sense!",

            "Text": "I'm not rationalizing... The only reason for the price movement ever, is buying vs. selling pressure. If there are more buyers than sellers the price will go up, and vice versa. I never said there was a bear trap. Since this dip started, the short positions have been making money by selling and buying back in at a cheaper price (for instance, if one sold 1000 btc at 3550 and bought back those 1000 coins at 3150, they would have profited 400k). We hit a new low, which only makes sense for the short positions to buy back in. I am saying it's a bull trap because the price bounced off 3580 twice, meaning that there is a strong sell support at 3580 (the short positions are selling aggressively at 3580). it just tested 3580 again and got rejected again. I agree that there needs to be a catalyst here to start a bull market, and there is no catalyst currently. In fact January is right around the corner, which historically is always a low period for crypto. I have been buying crypto all the way down this dip, and will buy all the way up, and continue to do so after. The reason for my post in the first place was to help explain what was going on to the OP.",

Followed by bulls who think that the price is making a breakthrough... Literally a text book bull trap. Price has bounced off the 3580 support three times now, too much selling power for it to move further up. Reason I posted in the first place was to explain to the OP that the short positions probably contributed to the raise by closing positions, and were probably not dumb enough to open a short at 3200-3150 as the risk would be very large. Also, OP was talking about a potential rally... Once again doesn't seem likely based on the 3580 support (a relatively small support of only \\~300 coins) holding up on three separate occasions.",

And keep in mind the %'s are a lot bigger down here.\n\nPrice found support on the 200MA weekly and is now moving off of it.  Wouldn't be so quick to assume it's a little trap that'll get rekt immediately.  \n\nAlso you seem a bit overly bear biased so lemme give ya a hint:  People are legitimately buying down here, we're in teh wheelhouse of the bottom going off all previous macro retraces in BTC history.  You're acting like the only way buying could exist is through shorts closing or it being a trap.",
