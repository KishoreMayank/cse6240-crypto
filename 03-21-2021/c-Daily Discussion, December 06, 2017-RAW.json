I haven't checked right now but I believe around 16,500,000 have been mined. If BTC will ever fall to pieces it will be after all 21 million has been mined and the big players all cash out (personally I hope scalability is sorted out by this point so BTC can shit all over FIAT and the price will skyrocket to crazy crazy levels). \n\nI'm a relatively poor guy from the UK and I'm taking a risk putting in 70% of my earnings into BTC and other cryptos but I'm not overly concerned TBH. Whether BTC is a commodity or not at this stage, there's too much vested interest from big players for the prices to cease rising, especially with bitcoin futures and hedge funds now getting involved. I mean hell! BTC is still in early adoption and is only now starting to make mainstream news on a consistent basis. I got in at \u00a32200 and I've been anxious at every rise and fall, but not so much anymore. The one thing I do know about BTC is... HODL!\n\nBut hey.. what do I know?",

            "Text": "The current buy is largely supported by banks. Once futures hit, they can use their large supply of btc to hedge against their own bets. This will create large fluctuations in the bitcoin price. The initial reaction will be a large dip, followed by a swarm of normies buying up more. The fluctuations will get smaller in magnitude as we get through the first half of 2018. This is because cryptocurrency is already a cultural phenomenon and the current price mirrors this, as it does in all new technologies spreading. This means the prices will steadily increase while becoming more stable, just like during the beginning of mobile phones, or the internet. Once this happens more services adopting crypto will start to appear, starting with btc and eth and will see a massive boost once solutions to the congestion problem start appearing. Cryptocurrency isn't a bubble in the traditional sense, its a new tech being adopted.\nbtw I saw this in a dream.",

The spikes and bubble talk do somewhat worry me, but I want to hodl for a while. \n\nI'm almost thinking I should take out $1000 and that way I have 0 chance of ever losing any money since I get my principal back, and it would eliminate my desire to take any money out in the future because it's essentially just winnings, not actually my money.\n\nI would never even really need to check the prices because I'd have no worries of whatever would happen; if it went to 0 one day I would not care and would not get hurt, if it went to $100k I would be gaining value. The peace of mind would be great.\n\nTo me, it's better than a GDAX auto-sell at $8000 because I would get the $1000 back but have no bitcoin at all left if I did that. If I sold the $1000 now I'd still have 5% of bitcoin left until it dropped to $0. But, the longer I hold on, the less bitcoin I'd have to sell off to get my $1000 back (assuming it keeps going up).",

They transposed the components of her double-barrelled surname. Also, the new card has no contactless facility (the one I received months ago does).\n\nTruly staggering incompetence.\n\nIt's good to remember that this is the system that Bitcoin is replacing.",

Held until early April this year when I wanted to move back home because my mom got seriously ill. I had no leads on meaningful work and I had bills piling up. I sold my minuscule coin for   ~1200 bucks to pay rent and eat more than 1 meal a day. I eventually got a solid job.\n\nCome October of this year I hear we are back up to like 10k.  I shit my pants and dump half a paycheck and cop some more. My friends and gf call me reckless considering the situation I just got out of/ am still dealing with. (Fuck Cancer)\n\nBut they don\u2019t know that the coins have bailed me out at my lowest, and I plan to fucking hodl until I can get a Tesla Roadster and act like I don\u2019t know nobody.",

            "Text": "Yep - only invest what you can afford to lose today. Just like any other investment. I am holding strong at 10% of my portfolio in crypto. It was more about 3 weeks ago but recently I diversified out and into stocks and index funds just to have a little less volatility in my life haha. No saying where this goes in 5-10 years because it could truly go way up or all the way down. At the end of the day, just imagine your bitcoin investment going to 0. Were you in it because you believed in blockchain tech? Or were you in it to get rich quick? A lot of times your own reasons for why you do something should be a good indicator as to how much you should invest. The difference between investing and gambling is that you actually foresee yourself losing it, rather than the other way around. Be smart and stay safe. You know things have gotten really intense when people are committing suicide over the \u201cwhat if\u201d of investments.  Hodl on!",

JRE having Andreas on his podcast has really gotten me excited for the future, but Andreas in 2014 was speaking from a time where the price didn\u2019t jump 2k in a day. I\u2019ve got a few questions though that raise concern for its future \n\nI know plenty of people who are just in this for the prospect of easy cash - one of my own relatives has invested an enormous amount of money into Bitcoin. Granted, he\u2019s made ridiculous returns, but I\u2019ve always vocally expressed concern (even now). \n\nWith Steam removing support for bitcoin, it breathes life into the reality that since bitcoins price is so stupidly volatile, it makes it impractical for it\u2019s original use - a currency. I see more and more people using Bitcoin like a stock. If less people are using it for transactions, and (let\u2019s face it) most new users are getting in for a quick profit, doesn\u2019t that literally make it a bubble? \n\nAnd also, when do you personally think the price is going to stabilize? My main gripe is that I would love to use Bitcoin as a replacement for fiat, but the volatility makes it practically implausible.",

It may not seem like much for some of you guys, but given the current price, it seems like a fortune to me.\n\nSome of the things i am most worried about are:\n\n1. The transfer it's self going smooth. I hear that transactions are very slow now and some people are saying their bitcoins get stuck in limbo for days on end ( or even lost, is that possible? ) due to insufficient transaction fees. The app doesn't seem to have a way to increase the transaction fee so I'm worried on ending up in that sort of situation. Any tips on preventing that?\n\n2. Am I understanding correctly cold storage as a permanent address? I've read a few articles about the idea but other then being slightly safer then keeping bitcoin on a app / exchange, I'm still not entirely sure how it works. Assuming I send my bitcoin there, what happens then? How do I use them after?\n\n3. I know bitcoin cash is hated here, hope this question doesn't annoy you. But I have bitcoin cash because I had bitcoin since before the split. I want to buy a cheap and simple cold storage wallet for bitcoin cash as well, but I don't want to spend 100$ like trezor. What cold storage would you suggest for under 25$?\n\nTl;Dr\n\nStep by step guide for Trezor and cheap cold storage alternatives.",

I'm currently using an Android app on my phone to buy and sell them.\n\nHow do I make sure my shit stays safe? What do I need to do? Should I transfer it to an offline source?

I was going back through some old emails and found I'd registered an account on Blockchain 4 years ago, presumably with a view to buying some Bitcoin but clearly never got that far.  Amusingly, looking back at my emails, I despondently said to a friend that I had \"missed the boat on bitcoin\" and that it wasn't worth putting any money into. Holy fuck am I kicking myself now. \n\nI excitedly went through old account information, found the details, and logged in hoping that some bitcoin had been accidentally dumped into that account but alas, the cupboards were bare. \n\nHo hum.

After having a short experience with bitcoin and seeing gains of up to at least 20% weekly currently, I was wondering if I could take it a step further and make some actual money to invest in something more stable and consistent in the long run on the stock exchange. I apologize if this sounds extremely uninformed, but I just wanted some input from adults who know what the fuck they're doing with their money and whether or not this is feasible. thanks",

Anyways, for quite a while I have been trying to convince my father to invest in bitcoin   (Ever since a year ago) but started nagging him in the 2700 dip.

I cannot invest much on my own since I do not have a lot of money and I am spending the money on various things (ilets, sat, etc) .

            "Text": "Hello. I bought a fraction of a bitcoin a few years ago. It's obviously now increased in value dramatically (though certainly not enough to consider selling just yet). I didn't know anything about bitcoins at the time and I still don't because I hadn't really thought about it until the news yesterday. I just want to know what kind of wallet I have (I've seen paper, software, hardware mentioned). All I know is that I have a couple of strings of text, a list of random words, and a password. Is this considered a 'paper wallet'? All I really know what to do is log in to blockchain.info with the wallet ID and password to see the amount I have. I don't need a long explanation, but I'd be very grateful if someone could just point me in the right direction by explaining what I have and how best to secure it. Thank you.",

            "Text": "Anyone having problem with coinbase? I\u2019ve been unable to get transactions to go through since 9k... all I want is .02 and it keeps getting reversed. totally sucks....\n\n\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has hit this wall. First attempt was with bank account, second was with another bank account, and this time as with a credit card. I\u2019ve talked to the bank and instructed them to approve requests from Coinbase but all I keep getting back from Coinbase is a reversal... it\u2019s fustrating seeing the price to continue to climb and I only wanted my .02....\n\nAny advice???? or experience with similar issues?? thanks is advance.

So essentially, it takes 10 minutes to confirm a trade correct? Also, it says that Bitcoin wants to keep it to 6 blocks added an hour correct?\n\nHow is it that there are SO many trades of BTC then? Wouldn't each trade need to be confirmed?",

Is this 1 transaction cleaning me out a few days after I made it? Why isn\u2019t it all gone? I\u2019m confused I must admit because I\u2019m not sure how to read the above.\n\nI did make paper wallets as Chrissy cards to give to the family, but I thought I never transferred to them. So I\u2019m unsure if I did put btc in the paper wallets now. There seem to be some transactions Chrissy eve. \n\nEdit- clicking through it looks like .35 btc ended up in a wallet that had 2999 btc in it. So I\u2019m gathering either I was hacked or maybe I moved it out and into an exchange. But the only exchange I used was btc-e, and that website looks like the US feds have closed it down",

And it seems a lot of discussions are starting to build towards that.\n\nWith that, my initial thought is that cryptos could explode with other markets falling and people look for a place to park money. If we assume that's the case, makes me wonder if we are actually in for some even more insane growth. \n\nAm I way off base here or does anyone else have similar thoughts?\n\nExtra note, i'm actually not in bitcoin yet. But I do have some stake in others though. Personally used to think bitcoin was just a bit overcooked and didnt want to get stuck in a correction.

It shouldn't hurt them since the btc price went up so idk why they would care. Anyways will coinbase care or chase my account. I want to close the account soon enough once I can confirm the unauthorized transactions are cancelled. Will coinbase cancel it if the bank rejects it? Will they keep trying to get the money? It's in their favor to not take it anyways. \n\nHow does the entire process work? Also how long does it take usually for coinbase support to respond? I'm gonna wait this out hopefully.\n\nThanks",

            "Text": "Hello peeps, Im the new guy. Bought in 2 days ago at 12.3k\u20ac and so far, definitely enjoying the ride. I was waiting for the dip for ages, but did the \"half now, half later\" strategy which was lucky, as dip is still not coming, but I know it will come at some point, And my plan is to do what this subreddit mostly suggests haha - no panic, buy more and HODL. This is just the intrudoction, I got a question! So I was realising I have to buy asap, but I wasnt able to find a comfortable enough method of buying, Coinbase wasnt accepting my Passport, so I just transfered money to my close friend via a bank(oh, the irony) and asked him to buy it for myself on the Coinbase, where he was already registered. It went all successful, right now he sent all of it to my Breadwallet. So here are my questions: \n1. Approximately, how soon am I recieving Bitcoin? Im aware of hard times at Coinbase thus it being slow, but you know... Thats my first experience and I be nervous of some sort. \n2. Can you suggest to me, please, some other, more convenient if possible, ways of trading bitcoin? Im from Europe, still not even sure how does it matter? Are GDAX, Bitfinex good options? ",

            "Text": ">DO NOT GUARANTEE YOUR LOSSES BY CONVERTING THEM TO CASH\n\nYou are actually advocating for a fallacy.  The value is already lost at that point, converting to cash doesn't magically turn the loss into a reality.  The reality is that the value is already gone.  \n\nIf someone's investment falls 50% overnight, they have 2 options.  Option 1 is to keep their money in that same investment because they really believe that the remaining money they have left will gain more in that same investment.  Option 2 is to cash-out because they believe there is another investment vehicle where that remaining money can realize greater gains over the long-haul.\n\nRefusing to admit that the money is only gone when you sell can be a terrible way to think.  What if someone did that with Sears stock, or Toys R Us, or KMart.  The key is you have to believe there is no better investment for the money you have left.  If you really believe that, then let it ride.",

I was expecting it to dip a good bit after crossing such a huge milestone, and was waiting to buy more. It hit ~$9300 and turned around so fast I didn\u2019t see it until it broke above 10k and into 11k. I would have made almost $100 if I hadn\u2019t sold at all.

BUT this might actually be a helpful step because once you have a middleman, this helps you sharpen the mind about how you can cut them out, and/or become one yourself at get your own cut of the profits..\n",

The main value back then was the potential for the price to reach the current levels, so you kind of knew you might get thrown around if you invest your whole stack right away.  So you just kind DCA'd your way in. Also no gov't had really even acknowledged bitcoin much, much less regulated it.  Very, very different group of hodlers and mindset.

Ahhh fuck :) \n\nWhatever happens, we don't have a crystal ball, but people are effectively placing bets by being in or out. I would say don't be all in bitcoin and don't be all out.\n",

A standard option is to do something like this: split up your key into several parts. Distribute some of these parts to several different people. Explain to them how it all works and who gets what when you die. Of course it is still up to them to split it correctly when you die. The problem is that they could conspire against you and put the key together while you are still alive and take all of your money.",

            "Text": "I have a preference for Bitcoin, but I will try to summarize the facts and my views.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a group that did not want Segwit implemented into Bitcoin.  They thought the code was too complicated or that off-chain scaling deviated from the original vision of Bitcoin.  So they forked prior to Segwit implementation, as after this point Segwit would basically be irreversible.  \n\nAnother thing to note is that they implemented a block size increase, which gives a higher limit on transactions per second but comes with some downsides like increased memory requirements for nodes.  The main argument for Bitcoin Cash is that you can currently send money cheaper with it than Bitcoin, as it has a larger transaction limit than Bitcoin and much less usage than Bitcoin.  However, like Bitcoin it would run into scaling issues with mass adoption.\n\nBitcoin Cash uses the same mining technology as Bitcoin, so there is somewhat of a competition to recruit miners to one coin or the other.  This was made even trickier due to the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) that Bitcoin Cash implemented, which was getting abused by miners to receive lots of mining rewards in a shorter window of time than had been intended by the development team.  The issues with mining profitability and sharing hashing power have died out a lot since the weeks following when the coin launched though.\n\nI personally believe that part of the resistance to Segwit was to maintain the viability of ASIC Boost by certain miners, which is a patented method of improving mining efficiency.  The mining of Bitcoin Cash is more centralized and started out with only a few anonymous miners, who could have performed a 51% attack.  They did not which I am actually glad of, but it still spooks me.  This is a bit of a controversial point, but I personally believe that ASIC Boost will lead to miner centralization, which has a host of issues associated with it.\n\nThe reason I support Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash is that I prefer the Dev team of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core), I think it has a smarter long term roadmap for scaling, I do not like ASIC Boost, and I think other alts such as Litecoin provide cheap and fast transactions than Bitcoin Cash so it is unnecessary.  \n\nThe reason the two communities are combative is a separate thing.  Honestly though, these things should hopefully be secondary to \"what is the better crypto technology,\" and I think they are in the market.  That being said on a social media site like Reddit these issues get a lot of attention so I will address them.\n\nThe issue that most people have with Bitcoin Cash is that they are trying to replace \"bitcoin\" instead of just being their own separate alt coin. I think that they have shills on the internet, they pay for exposure, they attempt to market manipulate, etc.  A pet peeve is that they use the BTC ticker for their subreddit, and they slander this one. If they had just branded as Bcash and done their own thing it would not have been an issue, but most Bitcoin Cash supporter are pretty clear that they would like to become \"the real Bitcoin\" and completely replace what we currently have.\n\nIf you are trying to choose I would ignore the politics aspect, where everyone is extremely biased, and focus on the technology which is easier to do a fair analysis on.  Reddit is a bit of a bubble and the politics are overplayed here because they can be interesting and divisive.\n\nTLDR of my views: Bitcoin Cash is a coin with some pros (cheaper transactions for the time being) and cons (worse long term scaling, Nodes require more memory, worse dev team.)  The reason that things have gotten so heated in the community is that Bitcoin Cash is seeking to replace Bitcoin as \"the real Bitcoin,\" instead of just accepting its role as an alt coin.  \n\nHope this helps, if you have questions feel free to ask but I probably wont answer until the weekend.\n",

A quick google search for \"how bitcoin works\" turns up numerous videos that say they are non-technical so you could also try one of those if you don't want to get bogged down in details.\n\nAs far as investing, most people use coinbase.com as it is US based, very simple to use, insured, and has an app you can use to buy and keep track of your bitcoins on your phone.  You can easily setup and account now and go buy $1 worth of bitcoin to try it out (though keep in mind the fees are kind of heavy for low amounts).  If you want a more advanced interface you can go to gdax.com, which is the exchange that coinbase uses under the hood (same company), but it requires more proof of identity to setup an account.",

            "Text": "If you, like many, believe that BTC has a bright future next year, then yes..adding now makes sense. Capital gains, depending on where you live, often gets lower after holding your investment for a period of time (usually one year or more). However, you're paying the gains tax based upon how much you have gained during that period of time. So adding more BTC will, as long as it appreciates, increase your tax in proportion to the gain. Whether adding increases/decreases your cost basis obviously depends upon whether you buy at a higher/lower price than your present cost basis.\n\nIn the best of all worlds, you are going to get a better ROI when buying an appreciating asset at lower prices (such as when it dips).\n\nFor the sake of simplicity:\nScenario 1-- Say you own 5BTC and your cost basis is 10k in 2017, it goes to 20k in 2018 and you sell. Your tax is based upon that 50k profit.\n\nScenario 2-- Say you own 5BTC and your cost basis is 10k in 2017, but you buy two more BTC around this time at 15k. It goes to 20k in 2018 and you sell. Your cost basis is 11,428.57/BTC (5/7*10000)+(2/7*15000) =11,428.57\n\nYour profit is now 7*11,428.57 = 80000, so you would pay tax on that $80,000.",

I remember back in 2013, *everyone* here was acting like 1k was the permanent floor, and that you'd have to be a troll to suggest any major dip below that. And then, of course, it fell to 200-300 USD and stayed there for years.\n\nI can't tell you when the best time to buy in is, nobody can. I'd just say that if you want to buy it, do what seems right to you, and stick to that decision. Bitcoin is very volatile, so don't just panic sell for a loss if it dips after you buy in.",

There's no EPS, no CEO, no quaterlies, no product, nothing.\n\nIf it's truly a currency then it's not even a security. And if it's a \"store of value\" then it has no use since it can never actually be used for anything other than storing value.\n\nThis is straight up speculation. There's no rhyme or reason, no rationality, and certainly no \"investment.\" It's even got market manipulation via this sub. If everyone is bought into the \"HODL\" meme it means the value is being manipulated up through scarcity. If everyone on here panic sold the price would plummet, like you often see with stocks. And to top it off, these \"exchanges\" go down whenever there's a big sell off like an artificial circuit breaker. Amazing.\n\nDoesn't mean you can't make real money though!",

The market cap of gold is $7.8 trillion. \n\nBy comparison, the total size of the cryptocurrency market (altcoins and all) stands at about $161 billion as of October 26th. \n\nI think BTC could easily eat 30% of gold's market cap by end of 2018. My math may be a bit rusty here, but that puts over $100k/coin. Just sit back, relax, and ride this dragon. ",

The price has done it in the past. This is a volatile market and it's unlike anything we have ever seen before. Using our traditional modeling tools to predict the crypto market is like using a sextant to navigate to Mars. If you believe that years in the future this currency will have value then there is no wrong time to invest. If you think it's just a passing craze that will deflate in a few years then there is no point in investing at all. ",

So you see the chart getting steeper and steeper and steeper, the rallies happen faster (20% increase in a day), and faster (40%!), and faster (80%!) and so on. \n\nBut there's a problem with a pattern where the growth rate keeps doubling. Mathematics. Eventually the rallies happen so fast that the chart goes vertical and there's nowhere else to go but waaaay back down.   This is why the long-term [Bitcoin Chart](https://i.imgur.com/q0WaWUG.png) is worrying to me and many others.\n\nWhere we are right now, who knows. I can't give advice for your investments.

To have coins, they would have to either already have bought them, or buy them now.\n\nThis could be the reason why the price is going up.\n\nIf that's the case, and they dump all their coins to tank the price, two extremes could happen: 1. People panic-sell, driving the price lower than what it would have been without this manipulation. 2. The market gobbles up the cheap coins because it was established that a coin can be worth 19k, the price drops a bit, but is still higher than a week ago.\n\nNote that in either case, they can make a lot of money because of the futures.\n\nOnce they've dumped all their coins, they can't do it again, unless they buy in again, driving the price up. Which they might, again making money with the futures (at the expense of other futures traders).\n\nHowever, if they try to tank the price, there will be one group motivated to keep the price up: The people who sold them the futures contracts. So *they* may gobble up the cheap coins, *buy some more*, drive the price up a bit further, and make a killing on the futures.\n\nWhat I think is likely (but keep in mind that I'm no expert) is that a lot of money enters the market and tries to mess with the price. This will increase volatility, but at the same time drive the price up, up, up.",

It's disconcerting in here to see people calling it \"FUD\" or \"liberal media agenda.\" Regardless of your position on climate change (though for a supposedly high-tech community like Bitcoin it's pretty unnerving to see anything like denialism being posted), the increasing energy expenditure isn't sustainable from the moon math lens. That means one of several things will happen:\n\n1. Bitcoin's growth will be limited by energy availability (either by regulation or by market forces),\n2. A different, \"cleaner\" crypto will take over (like a PoS-type project),\n3. Some modification will be made to Bitcoin to make it operable at lower energy costs,\n4. The introduction of renewables will progressively diminish the need for concern,\n5. Some combination of the above.\n\nThe one thing we can be sure it *won't* be is \"lol nbd nothing to worry about\" ",

It shows the price they want to sell at and the amount they want to sell. On the bottom of the order book in green is **DEMAND**.  These are people that want to buy bitcoin.  It shows the price they want to buy at and the amount they want to buy.\n\nDead center of the screen is another representation of the order book (where it says \"Mid Market Price\").  This is where supply meets demand.  That is what determines the \"price\" of bitcoin.  If you look at the orange part of the graph, you will probably see some stair steps at certain values (might have to zoom out, use the +/- buttons), this is because people like to pile up sell orders at specific price points (also referred to as walls).  The price cannot climb above these price points until all of these bitcoins are bought first.  You can mouse over the graph and see how much you'd have to pay, or how much you'd receive if you filled all those orders.\n\nAbove the central graph is a price graph over time.  It shows how the price has changed in the last few minutes/hours/days.  Green means the price went up in that timeframe, red means it went down.  The grey bars at the bottom show the volume of bitcoins that were sold in that timeframe.\n\nOn the right is the trade history. This shows the actual trades occurring on the exchange in real-time.  You can see how much bitcoin was transferred from one person to another, and how much the other person paid for it.  Green means they paid above mid market price for the bitcoins, red means they paid below mid market price.",

            "Text": "Bitcoins aren't like bread, you can't just go to the supermarket and buy one.  Instead you have to buy one from another person that wants to sell, but finding other people that want to sell can be time consuming. So people congregate at what are called \"exchanges\" (such as [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD)) in order to \"exchange\" their currency for another one.\n\nPeople can set whatever price they want to on this exchange.  I can go on an exchange right now and say I'll pay $1 for 10,000 bitcoins, but nobody will sell to me because there are tons of other people with much better deals.  In fact, the exchange automatically sorts all the deals by order of price and puts them into two categories, sell orders (supply) and buy orders (demand).  Where these two meet is called the \"Mid Market Price\".  Which is what everybody talks about as the price of bitcoin going up/down all the time.  Almost 100% of the time, the difference between the lowest sell order and the highest buy order is $0.01, meaning we can easily pinpoint what exactly the current mid market price is.\n\nThe price changes as supply and demand changes.  Imagine if tomorrow a research journal came out proving that bitcoins cured cancer.  Demand would skyrocket but supply would stay the same (or go lower as people hoard them for their newfound ability).  What do you think would happen to the price?  Well it would go up of course because tons of people want to buy and nobody wants to sell.\n\nConversely if tomorrow an article came out proving that there was a major security hole in the bitcoin algorithms, demand would plummet, and supply would increase drastically as people try to get rid of their coins.  What would happen to the price?  It would plummet because demand has evaporated and supply increased drastically.\n\nPrice is all about supply vs demand.",

The answer I hear most to this question is buy some now buy some later. \n\nThere are actually 3 ways to invest a lump sum.\n\nAll now: benefit the most immediately from exposure to the market.\n\nMonthly or weekly basis: (dollar-cost averaging or DCA) buy a fixed amount, say $20 every monday no matter the price. Smooths out variance because you'll buy dips as well as peaks. But only moderate exposure to the market.\n\nWait for a dip: zero exposure to the market because your money isn't in BTC! but if you feel strongly that the market will go down, the same amount of money will purchase more millibits of bitcoin at the lower price.\n\nI bought a little up front, a little when it rallies up, and a little when it goes down. Had I bought up front, I'd have better profits but a more stressful adjustment period/might have panic sold. I recommend 1/3 now, 1/3 every monday, and 1/3 reserve for dips. Good luck!",

This is trickier with bitcoin so it's hard to say what price a correction would end up at. ",

            "Text": "This is an extremely good question. I've asked myself how cash settled futures on such a scarce good will affect the underlying price.  \n\nWhat CAN happen is that if somone with deep pockets has a very large futures position, they can 'force' the price down/up to close so they are profitable on the trade.  (this commonly happens with equities, when several types of derivatives will trend towards 'max pain' levels  towards the 'triple witching hour'). Since there is only a small number of BTC out there (and most of them presumably are retail traders), only a small amount of BTC traded can have a huge effect on the price (ie: 400 btc in any one direction can move it 5-10%).. while 400 x 17k sounds like alot of money - if you have a large enough futures position (1000 contracts) it is chump change.  \n\nIts hard to say whether this is 'good' or 'bad' - it just makes it an easily manipulated tool for investors with deep pockets... I would expect to see the volatility increase (rather than parobolic increase, tehre will be similar amounts of volatility but with ups and downs)",

            "Text": "Each trade *does* have to be confirmed eventually, as long as it's an address-to-address transfer (wallet to wallet). Trades on exchanges are kept track of by the exchanges, who basically keep a book of IOUs for all their users - hence those can seem instant. But remember, you don't own your coins if you don't own your private keys - so eventually you'll want to transfer coins stored on an exchange to a wallet whose private keys YOU control, which means you'll have to deal with wallet-to-wallet transactions when you withdraw from an exchange eventually anyway.\n\nBitcoin has 1MB blocks now, so only ~3 transactions can be confirmed per second.\n\nSegWit, an upgrade to the network protocol, is another way to send a transaction that separates some of the block data into an add-on structure and relieves some memory pressure, enabling up to ~1.8MB blocks in theory (and thus more transactions per block, increasing transactions per second). SegWit adoption isn't that high though yet, so the 1MB block limit seems to be a rate limiter at the moment.\n\nYou can check the number of [unconfirmed transactions here](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) though - looks like there are around 215k transactions that have yet to be confirmed as of the time of this post. Bitcoin will have to chug through this \"backlog\" and get those added to the blockchain eventually - but right now, people who pay higher fees get priority in being added to the blockchain. Transactions will take way longer than 10 minutes if you don't pay to skip the line, basically.\n\n[This chart](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#4d) shows the mempool's transactions over the last four days - the colored bands represent different \"transaction fee buckets,\" represented by Satoshis per byte of transaction data. So right now, to get confirmed as quickly as possible, you'd have to pay between 300-500 Satoshis per byte to be a high priority transaction that is likely to be included in the next block. Satoshis (sats for short in a lot of places) are the preferred name to represent the smallest possible unit of a Bitcoin, .00000001 BTC. So 300-500 sats means that the average transaction must include a fee payment of around .000003 to .000005 BTC per byte of transaction data to have the highest likelihood of being included in the next block.",

You could also use a software wallet if you didn't want to worry too much about keeping a physical paper wallet safe. (I'm somewhere between \"I'm just testing this out\" and \"HARDCORE ENTHUSIAST\" so I am utilizing paper wallets as they give me more of a sense of security than a software wallet.

            "Text": "1) Gdax deposits can take like over a week. My brother did it to avoid fees and ended up losing out on way more money as the price climbed while he waited for it to clear. Eventually I just bought the coin for him and he transferred me money. I've never used Gdax, just gemini for me.\n\n2) Buy some now, then wait. Maybe 50/50. No one knows wtf is gonna happen even 10 mins from now. Or just go all in. I would definitely NOT hold all your money and wait for a dip. One might happen but you don't know by how much or when. Example: When we hit 8k, I sold some coin, expecting a dip. Well the dip was only down to like 7.8k. Not enough for me. So I waited. Eventually I bought back in at about 8.2k. So that might happen. You wait for the dip but think it'll get bigger and then it's gone.",

It\u2019ll eventually pass $15k, but I\u2019m predicting a dip at that number, so I don\u2019t see a major pullback till then. Best thing is to wire your fiat to an exchange and just buy in with half and wait for a correction with the other half. That correction might not ever come though or it might come hard as fuck and the price drops to $5,000 again or lower. It\u2019s just a way to play it safe because if it does tank hard you wanna be able to take advantage of that! I watched it dip from $11,800 to $8,500  last week... no fiat yet to buy and so I\u2019m helpless to take advantage. ",

So, it's likely that it will drop significantly in the near future. However, it is possible that the current push is due to implementations such as Lightening, so maybe it will have more staying power... \n\nA reasonable approach to investing right now would be to move some funds in slowly over the next week or two while watching the price.

Basically You start with one chain, and when a fork hits, each new chain uses the original chain, but all new transactions after the fork only occur on that chain. So, using Bitcoin Cash as an example...   \n  \nYou have the original Bitcoin chain. This chain splits into 2 chains with the fork. So, you have the Bitcoin you had before the fork on the Bitcoin fork and the Bitcoin cash fork. \nthe two forks can't interact with each other, but because they use the same base fork, you have two copies of that original Bitcoin.  \n  \nDoes that make sense?  \n  \nTo add onto that, if you have a Hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S, it can distinguish between the two forks and it allows you to go into the different wallets of each fork. So it creates a new Bitcoin Cash Wallet on the new fork, and you keep your old Bitcoin wallet on the old fork.",

The economy is going to get another few nut-shots between now and 2019 and I might be obliged to leave.\n\nIf things go full Greece and I encounter capital controls while I'm trying to emigrate, then at least I can take my bitcoin and have a surer position when I land.\n\nIn a less doom-monger kind of way, this has the capacity to do a lot of cool stuff.

While this is certainly possible, it is by no means certain that it will happen; it could end up being another crypto coin that takes this, or banks could start their own private blockchains. So, if you think that the world in general would benefit from this, then buying bitcoin can help progress it to that point!\n\nAlternatively, it can be a cheap way to send money abroad; also with the upcoming lightening additions, many more stores are likely to start accepting it.",

            "Text": "Copying my answer from eariler:\n\n(Welp formatting got lost in translation, sorry)\n\nI am starting to convince myself this is an orchestrated pump and dump. There are many hedge funds who have delved deep into Bitcoin now, and what is going on looks like a classic strategy.\nAs I mentioned in the previous thread, this is my theory:\nThey are clumsily buying up coins, that is to say, they're not being subtle in how their orders are handled (which a stock trader would for instance, in order to prevent the price from going up before their full purchase is filled). This is to purposefully increase the price whilst increasing their stock.\nWhen futures go live, buy puts (a put is a short position - i.e. price goes down, put value goes up) like there's no tomorrow, they'd likely go balls-deep in puts, expect huge order sizes on launch.\nThey will then chuck enormous sell blocks at the market to scare the shit out of all hodlrs, stimulating a price crash.\nPut prices rocket on back of price pullback - sell puts at mega profit\nRepurchase bitcoin or walk away with profit. More likely the former to rinse and repeat.\nPump and dumps are illegal in stocks, currency, etc. but would be much easier to hide in Bitcoin.\nHow to defend? Execute a short squeeze:\n\"A situation in which a heavily shorted stock or commodity (Bitcoin) moves sharply higher, forcing more short sellers to close out their short positions and adding to the upward pressure on the stock. A short squeeze implies that short sellers are being squeezed out of their short positions, usually at a loss.\"\nBy buyers rapidly increasing the price and volume at which they buy Bitcoin, we can \"squeeze\" shorters out of their positions. Look at Icahn vs. Ackman with their Herbalife battle as an example of a nicely executed squeeze. Ackman had to close out his short position and restructure a new short position.\nWhilst these shorts are structured as futures, it means you can't technically squeeze anyone out of their position. However, if the BTC price were to continue going up, these futures would become worth less and less, and hedgies using leverage may be closed out by their brokers (if they don't increase margin cover) in effect being squeezed.\ntl;dr - When Bitcoin price starts to plumment, buy Bitcoin.",

            "Text": "You'd be better off HODLing and paying off the car with USD, IMO. The problem is that USD loses value progressively year after year, and quite a lot. \n\nSo if you're on a contract for a payment of $X, paying that for multiple years will net you more Bitcoin in the end than paying it off at once with Bitcoin (remember, capital gains tax) then trying to buy back in as the price is going up. \n\nBut that's just my 2c. It makes it harder, but just HODLing and using your USD for purchases instead is the wisest right now.",

There brokerages (the ones I spoke with) will not be allowing leverage until they get a fell to the market. Also, there will be no initial shorting or future options. The shorting and futures will come at a later date when they feel more comfortable with the market. At a future date some brokerages will then allow 200% of the 33% margin.\n\n>It appears they are getting into the market slowly. \n\nI feel like not having shorting and leverage will make the impact of the futures markets a lot less in the short term.",

            "Text": "Not quite accurate. For every buy, there is an equal and opposite sell. What drives the price one way or the other is how much it's being bought/sold for relative to the current price.\n\nFor example, assume the current going price is $100. Bob advertises that he's will to sell his 1 BTC for $110. Sally decides to buy it at that price. Thus, the prices rises to $110.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Sally (or anybody else) doesn't want to buy at $110. She only wants to pay $90. When Alex comes along and sells his 1BTC to Sally for $90, the current price drops to $90.\n\nThat's a very simplified example, of course, but it illustrates that price isn't dictated by more buyers than sellers (the number of buyers and sellers is always equal). Instead, it's dictated by the price people are willing to buy and sell at.",

            "Text": "Say current price of bitcoin is around $17,200. Now imagine investors have put out a \"buy order\" totaling 500 bitcoins at the price point of $17,000. This means they are willing to buy 500 bitcoins at $17,000. If the price of bitcoin goes down to $17k, the buy wall starts eating up any bitcoins put up for sale. Until this \"wall\" of buy orders is fulfilled, the price of bitcoin will not go below $17k. Hence, the Buy wall prevents price of bitcoins dipping below $17k. A sell wall operates similarly, but prevents price going beyond the sell wall.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

Given how small bitcoin is and how large the derivatives market can become it would be easy for an agent with a hefty wallet to wreck the market.  The question is, are they going to come in swinging the wrecking ball or are they going to pump the price first and then bring it down? If I had a 500M hedge fund and a 100M bank account, I'd probably try to spike the prices to 50k+, load up on short contracts and bring it down, rinse repeat, roll over in more cash. ",

Hindsight will tell us in the end, but for now we're still in a pattern of monstrous increases, rapid and sharp declines, then bouncing back to where we were at before the drop. \n\nIf we fall, then bounce back above the last high (13400ish) then there's more room to run. The next \"leg\" in this increase from a charting pov is like... 18500.  If the bounce fails to get back to 13400, then we'd be in a new pattern and there's just no telling what would happen next. Sorry to sound so vague, but that's investing for you!\n\nEdit: Even in the event of a BIG crash, I do think that a recovery to the same position or higher would still happen. It would just take longer.",

Dollars don't have an intrinsic value, yet we use them to store it.\n\nSecond of all, why do you say bitcoin has no intrinsic value?  If I gave you a machine that could securely teleport gold bars or dollar bills to any person in the world, wouldn't that be valuable by itself?  Bitcoin isn't just a number stored digitally in a computer somewhere.  It is a token that grants you access to that machine.  A machine that can send value to anybody anywhere without anybody being able to prevent it.  People are just having a hard time agreeing on how much that token should cost.",

A dip is certainly possible.  I don't 'think likely in the short term, but it is 100% possible.  If you have made meaningful gains to your life, consider diversifying.  Capitalism tends to create bubbles, i have seen many in my life time now.  Even transformative technologies like the internet, the railroad, etc. tend to bubble. I have known many people waste or recklessly gamble fortunes thinking they could always beat the market.  Its not a pleasant experience.\n\nBut by what attribute of Bitcoin do you think disqualifies it as a commodity though?  Whichever hardfork you choose, the tokens are commodities.\n\ndefine Commodity from google:\n\na raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee;\n\n\na useful or valuable thing, such as water or time.\n",

The protocol is defined, and anyone who's writing a wallet should be implementing it.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see how popular it is. It's not all things to all men. It's got cases where it really shines. Anywhere you need to make repeated payments would be ideal. Like if I wanted to do a big sell but A) Don't want all my coins on the exchange at once and B) don't want to be eaten alive by miner fees. I could use this to transfer small amounts over time securely.\n\nIt's got shortcomings too. It's a hassle to pay someone new and the other end has to be online during the payment. No \"Hi Mom, send bitcoin\" here. But there are plans to make it more flexible in future. Imagine something like a Patreon button in the browser for micropayments to access the next page of a webcomic or to access a newspaper website for a day. You are actually paying Patreon and they sort out paying the artist. We'll see how that plays out. It could really cut down on banner advertising, but probably increase the number of paywalls.\n\nMainstream use needs a killer application, I think. How *you* go about using it really depends on what shows up in your wallet of choice.",

            "Text": "I'm not an expert but from what I understand, futures can be bought and sold, and Wall Street will most likely be manipulating the market to profit in both cases. \n\nSay Billionairebrah buys a futures contract, committing to buy 1000 BTC at $20k each in 2 week's time. As long as they keep this contract and don't sell it, they are guaranteed this sale so it is in their interests that the price is greater than 20k in 2 weeks. So with all their billionaire friends, they agree to buy shitloads of BTC, drive the price / hype up, causing more investment from new naive investors trying to make a quick buck. \n\nOn the other hand (and you're right, this is probably of greater concern), they could be accumulating shittonnes of BTC atm, preparing to sell futures. So they could sell a whole bunch of futures contracts to average investors, guaranteeing a bitcoin for 15k in 2 weeks time. In the mean time, they dump all the coins they've accumulated, causing the price to dip well below 15k and use the money they made from the futures to buy more BTC. And the snowball effect works in this case too; people panic sell, further driving down the price by an amount noone can anticipate.\n\nAlso remember buying / selling large amounts of bitcoin isn't the only way to manipulate its price. Wall street is likely to collude with people who have influence in the media / governments to manipulate the market in ways result in both of them profiting. The Chinese government is suspected to do this regularly, as well as executives (e.g. Jamie Dimon). With all these variables, you'd really need a time machine to be sure of the best strategy for the next few days\n\nI'm sure there are many people on here who can explain what I'm trying to say much clearer / more accurately than what my limited understanding allows me to but basically, I am very scared and noone knows what the effect of the futures is going to be except probably the reptiles who are going to exploit them.

If there are lots of miners then blocks will be found faster than that. Every so often bitcoin automatically adjusts how hard it is to find a block. If blocks are being found too fast then the adjustment will make it harder and vice-versa.\n\nSince the massive increase in price lately the number of miners have increased quite a bit, so the rate of finding blocks has increased beyond what it should. See [here](https://fork.lol/blocks/time) for a chart of this. The BTC row shows the average number of blocks found per hour over the last 3 hours, 6 hours, etc. This number should be 6. Since it has been 7-10 the difficulty adjustment will make finding blocks more difficult to correct this.",

If that rate is faster than six per hour the difficult increases, if it is slower then it decreases.\n\nI mentioned volume and price because those things affect mining rates, but there are other things too, for example bitcoin cash has a large effect. If it is more profitable to mine something else many miners will leave to the other coin which will slow down the bitcoin rate.\n\nThe full \"marketplace\" of hash power so to speak is rather more complicated than people could have initially anticipated. That said, at the moment, the price of bitcoin is the largest effect on the amount of mining power. Because of this miner have flowed to bitcoin which will lead to a difficult adjustment.\n\nThe difficulty will adjust so that the rate is just right. Because difficulty is only adjusted every so often there could be a problem when miners then leave for bitcoin cash and then there aren't enough miners and we will have to wait for the next difficult adjustment. So we will see a block rate reduction due to the difficulty adjustment and then subsequently due to some of the miners leaving.\n\nBitcoin cash does a continuous difficulty adjustment - that is they adjust the difficulty every block, which is something that I think they have (eventually) gotten quite right.",

If your investment decreases you can get margin called and the brokerage can liquidate your holding to pay themselves back and you can even end up owing more money on top of your deposit. Personally, would never buy bitcoin on margin. With its volatility the way it is chance of margin call way too high. Credit card is an option, but be aware that selling incurs a capital gains tax on top of transaction fees/transfer fees.",

Enough that selling at 12-15k is PLENTY of gains by itself. \n\nNow add in the fact that you can short bitcoin. And you know lot of people will be doing that.\n\nYou hold a ton of bitcoin so you start selling for profit. It drops from 16k-14k.....then 13k....then 12k..... Uh oh shorts are looking good here.\n\nIf this drops to $10k in a day or two you are going to see panic selling from the early adapters.

It shows 3 \"input\" addresses because those 0.036BTC came from those three addresses (looks this way because the sender didn't have enough in one address, so their wallet used multiple) \n\nSo to clarify: On blockchain.info one arrow equals one transaction, green arrow means it goes into that address, red arrow goes out of that address.\n\nSpeculation:  \nyou created the paper wallet and filled it in step 1, changed your mind in step 2 and decided to refill the wallet in step 3. The full correct story is probably somewhere in your brain :)  \n\nIf you have further questions feel free to ask.",

            "Text": "> A crash is any sudden decline\n\nThat's the point, there was no \"sudden decline\", they are microcorrections. These are projections, and the results have been varying by the thousands. You said you saw BTC go as high as 20k today, all of my resources claim it topped just under 18.5. A friend told me Google claimed it was at 19 while every other service said 16. \n\nThis happens every day, the numbers are just larger lately. \n\n> You certainly can't flat out ignore them\n\nYou **have** to ignore them if you plan to buy low and sell high. They mean nothing when it comes to tall earnings, other than *try* not too buy on a 2 minute \"spike\".\n\n\n> The last 2 weeks aren't what concern me\n\nThey really should though, if you are buying. We've known a real and very large crash is due soon. If you aren't thinking about these things you may be in for a bad time. \n\n\nAs I said before, the crash is nothing to fear, I just want these fine people to prosper as much as they can.",

They'll hold your crypto for a few weeks as collateral until the payment completely processes but it's nice to get money instantly. If you wanna do a ton of money a wire transfer is worth it. USAA sent the money instantly and I had it in my Gemini account within an hour. I was doing the $500 a day in late Sept/Early Oct and realized bitcoin wasn't slowing down so I did the wire. \n\nEDIT: Coinbase has pretty steep fees. Gemini is 0.25%. Also I know Gdax has no fees, but you need to buy a certain way. Limit order I think. Again I've never used Gdax but I know my brother was paying fees because he was using the wrong buy option there.",

They mine thousands of bitcoins each month. They have to sell those thousands. Right now they would make more money doing OTC sales or slowly liquidating over the month. With the price going up they might as well hold onto them as long as they can while covering the utility costs and over head of their farms. With futures they can bet the price will drop and then go sell there hoard of thousands of btcs pushing the price down and creating panic to push the price even further down. its a win win for someone who holds a lot of btc and has to sell them to cover the costs of their business anyways. might as well short and make even more money.",

If you use a paper wallet do not link it to blockchain.info or you may as well post your private  key here.\n\nI made a paper wallet on a pc booted from portable Ubuntu USB, printed then emptied printer cache. Then like the noob I was I linked my wallet with Blockchain.info instead of just sending btc to it, and my blockchain.info account was hacked. Then I gave it up despondently, but awakened by the last surge I am now looking at hardware wallets. I don\u2019t know about GDAX, but I do know I suck a trading, so I\u2019m gonna wait for funds to clear in my exchange, buy as much as I can afford to lose next week, securely store then forget about for 5-10. Probably buy $100 a week and keep topping up to my hardware wallet, maybe in btc or maybe in alt. Probably btc though.\n\nI was listening to podcasts in 2013 advising to invest $100 or $50 or $20 a month. I reckon the advise still stands strong. Just be rock solid on security. Core filled brickwork steel reinforced with tied footings, primed, membrane sealed, epoxy coated tight on security. Protect yourself against everything from script kiddies to Russian hackers to girlfriends to piping wielding gangsters. Cos the culture of crypto is there is no ownership of keys. If you lose it you deserved to lose it.",

You may argue that government is corrupt, but nevertheless it exists.\n\n> Second of all, why do you say bitcoin has no intrinsic value? \n\nBecause it doesn't. If you have a traditional store of value, such as gold, it doesn't have to just sit in the vault. It could be used to make jewelry, weapons, electronics, medical equipment, even food.\n\nWhat can Bitcoin do? You can't use it as a currency, and if you store it you can't use it for anything other than sending it to other people to store.\n\nDo you not see this? Am I not explaining it well?",

(Hypothetically) buy in at \u00a310,000 and cash out out \u00a312,000 because you fear a dip.. or HODL for a year or 2 and cash out at \u00a350k+. Of course, there are no guarantees and there are risks involved, so I could be wrong.\n\nI'd be more interested in your arguments as to why BTC won't be worth $100k+ in the long term future though, as opposed to petty arguments about giving \"bad advice\" to people even though I put a disclosure on my post saying \"but hey...what do I know?\". It was my opinion, that is all.\n\nI'm also part of this group. I've invested around \u00a31,500 and so far hold around \u00a37,500. Not much in the big scheme of things. Point being, I could have cashed out at BTC value \u00a33,000, \u00a34,000, \u00a35,000, \u00a36,000... and the list goes on. During each milestone there has usually being a significant dip. I've HODL'd though and i'm very glad that I did each time! I think I'm in a decent position to offer my anecdotal opinion to people in similar positions to me, thank you very much. By all means though, explain to me why less well off people to cash out now rather than HODL long-term for significantly bigger returns?\n\nYes you're correct, apologies.

I would imagine there will be some more buying pressure because these would be legal guarantees to buy or sell an amount of bitcoin on a certain date or at a certain price.

            "Text": "Thank you very much. The .35 went out to an address which had .35 in . 35 out. The following address it went to had 2999 deposits to it totalling 277,000 bitcoins deposited. I googled the public key  and found this link: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wvz66/who_is_taking_my_bitcoins/\n\nSo at that time I, along with a crap load of other people, were hacked, the the value of what looks like would now be worth about $5.5 billion. \n\nI think what happened was I made a blockchain.info wallet, then moved my btc out of that into a paper wallet. But I messed up and linked the paper wallet to the blockchain.info wallet, because when I logged in today for the first time in 4 years I could see that I could transfer out of the paper wallet using the blockchain.info wallet. I put the private key for my paper wallet in blockchain.info wallet.\n\nWhen I first set up I didn\u2019t use 2FA. I heard about it, then I went back and set up 2FA a week later but had already been hacked. I must have had loggers or some malware from the dodgy utorrent warez that got my blockchain.info passwords. Searching gmail I see I had another unauthorised login attempt in 2016. Maybe the same data file with my passwords sold on years later or maybe the same dickwad trying again.\n\nCheap lesson really, could hv been a lot worse. \n\nI just got out at $23000 and and into ether. Will wait till it settles in the next few days, invest a bit more and swap back and check in another few years. After this I think I\u2019ll invest in a hardware wallet and paper wallets and be careful about not linking it to any website.\n\nI thought I was so goddam thorough with 2FA, paper wallets made offline from portable Ubuntu boot and I still managed to leave myself exposed.",

If there are more market order sells with limit order buys, that is when the price moves down, because you remove the highest limit order sells, leaving lower limit order sales.\n\nWhen you short stock, the institution loaning you the stock executes a market order buy, which drives the price up slightly (it has no real effect on a high liquidity stock). You hope the stock goes down, so you can execute another market order buy to make it whole.",

Thus by supply n demand laws one can easily see its value going up and up all the way to even a million many years from now. This is provided ofcourse that it remains the top crypto (this will come down to usage think a Samsung phone vs iphone) and it remains unregulated and decentralised. \n\nAs far as current situation goes it is certainly highly inflated but that almost certainly cause of the Wallstreet bankers getting in right now.  The more they buy the more the price goes up. They do not like this bitcoin cause they can't control it so the only thing they can do is inflate it and then one day short the shit out of it crashing down. They won't succeed provided the other majority of people hold. In this sense no it won't crash completely not for another year.  \n\nEdit: also don't look at it like a stock, this is not like the dotcom bubble though the market gives that appearance. Look at it like the Internet of money. Read that book if you really want to understand how this will all play out. Will it eventually stabilise to a proper price point, yes it will. Hard to say what that price will be. It could be 10k 50k 100k so on. Long ways to go. The current \"bubble\" may crash but the technology will live on and that's where it gets it value. ",

            "Text": "Gold's price far exceeds its use in jewelry and industrial applications. Why is gold more valuable than silver and copper which are both used in those ways? Gold isn't backed by a government and isn't used as a medium of exchange of goods and services. So why does Bitcoin need to be either of those things to have value?\n\nYou should research the things that make money valuable: durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. The reason that you don't understand why Bitcoin has value is because you don't know what gives money in general value. Bitcoin has all of the aspects above, with the only one that is even vaguely in question being \"acceptability\". None of those characteristics impose a requirement for something to exist in the physical world; digital goods can meet all of those characteristics. No need for government backing nor industrial uses.\n\nAlso, you can use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange (though we are currently in a period of high fees until new tech rolls out). I've used it to buy a lot of games and a computer. Almost all illegal drugs bought on the internet are bought with Bitcoin. How did you manage to conclude that Bitcoin can't be used as a medium of exchange?",

            "Text": "I feel like much of this is a problem of semantics.  Could you define what it means for something to be intrinsically valuable?  For me, something is intrinsically valuable if I can use it immediately to improve my life in some way, without having to change it.  Do you agree or disagree with this definition?  For example, cars, a house, food, are all intrinsically valuable.  Gold, dollar bills, and bitcoins are not.\n\n> They (dollars) have a value, namely being used in the exchange of goods and services\n\nYes but not an intrinsic one.  If you have to trade it for something else to improve your life, then the thing you initially traded away was not intrinsically valuable.  You can't drive a dollar bill to work or consume it for nutrients anymore than you could a bitcoin.\n\n> It could be used to make jewelry, weapons, electronics, medical equipment, even food.\n\nIt takes work to turn gold into something else.  Your work is adding the value to it, therefore by my previous definition of intrinsic value, gold is not intrinsically valuable.  Its only valuable because you can trade it for something else or you can add value to it by doing work on it.\n\n> What can Bitcoin do? You can't use it as a currency,\n\nYes you can: https://99bitcoins.com/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-companies-stores-take-bitcoins/  Also, you can go on to many different exchanges right now and use bitcoins to buy other currencies.  It is a currency that can be used to buy other currencies.\n\nNot to mention that bitcoin has properties that are inherently useful as a currency.  When I was young and played in the woods a lot with my siblings, we tried to use pinecones as a pretend currency.  Lets compare the properties of bitcoins, dollars, and pinecones as a potential currency.\n\n**Scarcity**:\nYou can't copy or create a bitcoin out of thin air.  There will only ever be 21 million of them.  Mining bitcoins is a process controlled by math.\n\nIts estimated around $70 million is counterfeit.  The federal reserve controls the creation of USD.  As long as you trust the federal reserve this is fine.\n\nPinecones are all over the damn place (at least where we lived).  The creation of pinecones is controlled by the trees!\n\n**Ease of transfer**:\nBitcoin can be sent directly to any person or entity that has a wallet.  Nobody can stop or reverse the transaction.  You don't have to trust anybody.  \n\nDollars must travel physically or through a banking system.  Fine as long as you trust the banks.  If they don't like what you are doing, they can stop it or reverse the transaction.  Sometimes mistakes happen and your money is lost, but you are reimbursed or the transaction is reversed.\n\nPinecones aren't heavy but they are kinda bulky.  You can't really put them in in your pocket.  You need like a wagon or something to cart them around.\n\n**Security**:\nNobody can take your bitcoins unless they have the private key to your wallet.  Where you keep that key (your pc, an exchange, a bank, a safe, your head) is up to the security of that system.\n\nDollars can also be stored in safes or in a bank. History has shown that banks have done a wide variety of undesirable things with people's money.\n\nNobody puts pinecones in safes, and you wouldn't be able to fit very many anyways.\n\n\nLooking at these properties, it seems like bitcoin is the most useful currency and pinecones are the worst currency.  I have no idea why we thought pinecones were a good idea...  Maybe you are fine with the properties of dollars as a currency, but as evidenced by the rise of bitcoin, many are not.\n\n> if you store it you can't use it for anything other than sending it to other people to store.\n\nThis isn't any different than gold.  You have to take it out of storage to do something with it...\n",

That's what it does.\n\nIt can't automatically sell for $9,000 if there is nobody there willing to BUY for $9k. Who are you going to trade with?\n\nThat's how we fell IMMEDIATELY from $10k to $9k just a couple weeks ago. There weren't enough orders in between $10k and $9k, but there were some at $9k, so people sold at $9k, only to see the next trades happen a couple minutes later back at $10k.",

It doesn\u2019t work like how you were saying because a tax is applied when an economic event occurs, not at the end of the tax year. It\u2019s a pay-as-you go system. Think about income taxes. You pay a little out of your wage every pay period, not all of it at once at the end of the tax year. \n\nAs for reporting, if you\u2019re trading stock, for example, the broker will automatically send the amount of your capital gain to the IRS. Idk if Coinbase will do the same. \n\nMoral of the story: any time you increase your wealth, the government wants a piece of it.",

That's why a ton of people \"hodling\" on here are in it for the long run and have been since $300 per coin in 2013, $1k per coin, so on. \n\nI got in with a few more hundred bucks back in June at $4k per bitcoin...so I'm not going anywhere selling just yet lmao. I think the Bitcoin concept is brilliant and if it can get refined and picked up 5 years from now in the big leagues, it's going to change everything on the Internet and in the economy. \n\nEdit: Also keep in mind alt coins are a lot of fun, and way cheaper too. IOTA was a highly talked about coin that was sitting at $0.87 in June, and now recently shot up to $5.00 roughly. Speculating cheap coins with promise is mildly addictive. ",

For instance perishable items are not a store of value because they inherently lose value over time.\n\n>But there are significantly better comparisons though. Weren't Beanie Babies considered a store of value during their peak? That seems like a better comparison to me.\n\nAs far as I know there were never any beanie baby futures sold, so for the sake of this discussion it would be a poor comparison. Additionally, there were not a limited number of beanie babies as they were always able to make more, whereas gold is limited by how much there is on earth and how much we can extract from the earth. Bitcoin is also limited, but in an artificial fashion. So, while gold and bitcoin are far from the same, for the sake of discussing the introduction of bitcoin futures gold is an apt comparison while beanie babies is not.",

This is the MAIN reason u hear all those famous people claiming it will be 1 million by 2020. No one can say the future but we can make estimations. As we know our underlying principles and other factors like altcoins, requirements for mass adoption, improvements in the technology etc.\n\nRight now it's looked as an appreciating investment instead of a currency hence utter lack of stability and also it's not tied down to anything. \n\nI'm still mad I can't invest in it now (too expensive).

But the problem is that there's no guarantee they fill.\n\nIf you place a $9k stop LIMIT order at $9k, the price could keep on falling to $8k or $7k or $5k, and your stop LIMIT order would still be sitting there at $9k, never filled. You would never have sold your coin and you'd still be long, even with the price at say, $5k.",

The differences between the two are that 1) they're run by two different companies 2) Coinbase has higher fees at ~3% where Gemini is ~0.25% 3) you can fund your Coinbase account via credit card, whereas you can only fund Gemini through bank transfer or wire transfer (However, Gemini also gives you access to your funds once you initiate the deposit i.e. you can trade with it 'instantly'. Similarly, Coinbase 'locks in' the price when you click buy, even if the funds haven't cleared yet.) 4) Gemini doesn't have a mobile app, I think Coinbase does.\n\nYou should be able to buy as small a quantity of bitcoin as you want on either Coinbase or Gemini. Also of note is GDAX is run by Coinbase (same login info and everything) but has lower fees at 0-0.25%.\n\nFor all exchanges, you don't control the private keys, they do! So a few weeks after you have the coins in your account, you should look on the sidebar about setting up your own paper or hardware wallet to keep your coins safe. Cheers",
