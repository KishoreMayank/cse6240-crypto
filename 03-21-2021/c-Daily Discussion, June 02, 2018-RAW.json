It's about phscology and confirmation that the doom and gloom being broadcasted by the banker's perspective is total crap.\nPlus, we hear institutional money is coming. We hear a bull run may be coming. Everyone is waiting for the signal, for a sign.\nThen when the timing lines up, and we see a few lifts, buyer confidence rises. Everyone jumps on board the same time and the bull run is initiated. \nThat's what happened last December. It was volume of small investments, not big players that created the December 20k ath.\nMy point? To hell with TA, and to hell with close minded banker-minded complacency. Phscology RULES the results.",

Some people argue that raising the block size can cause an increase in centralization due to the block chain growing in size faster as each block takes up more storage space. This means it could be more expensive to run a node? The hard drives we can buy today are a lot cheaper, faster and higher storage than the ones we had years ago when bitcoin started so this doesn\u2019t seem like a valid argument.",

Even so, if we just keep increasing the blocksize, at some point regular users will not be able to run a full node. the goal is to keep the network as light as possible for anyone, anywhere. scaling can take place on layer 2 without putting pressure on the main net. Segwit and lightning are here and work great, I would think the great scaling debate is maybe finally coming to an end.",

This should be enough time for people who got burned to lick their wounds and let big investors feel more brave.\n\nThat being said, I don't think the next major spike up will be as much speculation-driven. I think if the right mix of a political/macroeconomic event + greater availability to institutions will lead to a *real* bull run. This can happen really at any time. If investors don't especially want to sell then we can see a major spike up like 5-10x or more. I also wouldn't expect this to be the last major bull run for bitcoin either.",
