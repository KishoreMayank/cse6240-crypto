When the bulls run again, the crypto markets are influenced by everyday traders. Stocks can influence whales but only as much as they choose to let them influence it. But, these past few dormant weeks where the crypto market was holding between $217-$221 billion was exactly like I suspected - the whales were trying to gauge the stock market. If the economy crashes, so will Bitcoin. People lose faith in volatile assets during an economic recession, depression etc.  So, yes we should pay attention to the stock market but only to an extent and understand that they aren\u2019t necessarily correlated.",

            "Text": "I have believed in many asset classes: gold, oil, natural gas, stocks, sectors like tech, bitcoin. But it doesn't make any sense to HODL any of those classes when the statistical odds are against them. If you knew for a fact that an asset class was going down for 1 year you would juggle classes to your benefit, of course you would. So while no one can say that an asset class is going to rise tomorrow it is possible to say that a class has reversed and that historical odds favor a further rise after such a reversal. That may not be correct, but it is better than other rationales. If you don't have a proven, tested reversal metric you should. There is nothing indicating that bitcoin is showing a reversal. S&P (to the negative) and gold (to the positive) have just proven the probability. One should trade accordingly.",

            "Text": "People are afraid of a big Bitcoin crash. I hope people understand that this is mathematically almost impossible, no matter what happens. If you look at how fast the interest dropped during the big crash in january, it dropped from the level of 100 to 46 in 2 weeks time. And then from 58 to 19 in february. Because of miners and average joe cashing out. The interest level between june and october is almost a horizontal line, ranging between 10 and 8. It's almost impossible for btc to have another big crash. For that to happen, the interestlevel must drop to something like 4 or 5 in 2 weeks. That won't happen, cause we're dealing with a horizontal interest line and there's nothing to cash out like in january. I hope people finally understand that price always follows interest. Now, will there be another bullrun in short term? Of course not. That's like saying could there have been a bullrun so close after the .com bubble? That's almost impossible, cause you deal with market sentiment. Why would anybody wants to stand on a vulcano shortly after an eruption? You'd want to stand on it after a couple of years, when new flowers and bushes have grown. Same for Bitcoin. It will take approximately 4-6 years before a new bullrun. That's how much recoverytime human brain needs to recover from the biggest crash in human history.",

Yes the highs are getting lower but thats only 1/2 the picture. There's obviously plenty of folks snapping up bitcoin when it gets cheaper.\n\nNot to mention all the breakthrough developments in 2018, and the resistance shown against a coordinated take-over attempt. Very exciting year really. \n\nYou should try and look at the positive side of things a little more.",

But, these past few dormant weeks where the crypto market was holding between $217-$221 billion was exactly like I suspected - the whales were trying to gauge the stock market. If the economy crashes, so will Bitcoin. People lose faith in volatile assets during an economic recession, depression etc.  So, yes we should pay attention to the stock market but only to an extent and understand that they aren\u2019t necessarily\n\nThen why the sudden extreme buys/sells?",

If you want next block confirmation, the median transaction fee to be included is a whopping 6 cents.\n\nTransaction fees got really high for fairly short period of time: [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html)\n\nFor some reason, this has continued to be used as a talking point as though it's still a current issue. In addition to the decreased transaction volume, exchanges began batching more, adoption of segwit increased, and the lightning network came online, all of which increase the capacity of Bitcoin and will help with higher levels of volume in the future.\n\nIf there's an oligopoly of miners in China, there are some straightforward solutions to that. Increase mining elsewhere. If China is using cheaper energy due to lax environmental standards, increase pressure for higher environmental standards, and increase the availability of energy in other places (increased investment in renewable energy with balancing high-generation low-demand times with Bitcoin mining, at least until storage technology improves) - both of which have the added benefit of helping improve our global energy system regarding climate change. Have publicly owned bitcoin mining if governments have strong concerns with China if this is still an issue - it has the benefits of increasing the security of Bitcoin, decreasing any potential issues with relying on China, and has the potential to generate a profit for different governments.",

Because it all has to do with the level of interest. Price follows interest. The interest level is pretty much stable between 11 and 7 on a scale of 100 the past 7 months. The chance of a sudden drop in interest from 8 (current level) to 5 in one week, which will bring the price to something like 5000-5500, is close to zero. You just don't understand. Maybe in 2 or 3 months, the price can drop to 5000 because of declining interest. But not in one or two weeks. This is based on google data on interest. I said the same a couple of days ago, that the price cannot drop below 5800 right now. Before the crash. You can look up my post. It's all based on data ",

            "Text": "It is based on google trend data, which is extremely reliable. Proof is the google trend graph follows the price graph very closely. The price drop the past 7 months is due to declining interest and nothing else.  You can look up yourself. I'm willing to bet all my money that the price won't drop below 5000-5500 next week. In other words, there won't be another big crash next week. Price could drop to 5000 in the course of weeks or months, but it's extremely unlikely that a sudden big fall happens again, and if it happens, price will go up again very fast to the same level because of interest level. You look at past crash of crypto in 2013, and the big pattern is the same. After a big crash, a long sideways movement happens. Same goes with other big crashes, for example the stockmarket in 2000. Once high volatility is gone, there is usually no big danger anymore. When volatility is gone, it's the best moment to invest. Most speculators are gone. Ironically, this is the moment where the least amount of persons invest. ",

There is no real incentive to sell right now, cause there's nothing to cash out. The price might slowly go down in the course of months because of slow decline of interest, but we probably pretty much hit the bottom. Let's say the bottom is 5000 in april 2019 or something like that. If btc has another bullrun in 2022, you must invest now if this is the bottom. or wait a bit. Another crash like in january is highly unlikely. It basically almost never happens, unless an asset just dissappears after a big crash. If you believe btc will dissappear, then obviously you must not invest in it now. ",

Though you didn't really address my main point. You say \"If btc has another bullrun in 2022\", assuming you want to wait for years while you investment tanks any bullrun in the future is going to require massive amounts of buying power and renewed interest from both Mum and Dad investors as well as institutional money. I just don't see another buying surge ever happening again, btc had it's moment last year and now it's lost the confidence of almost all regular investors (not blockchain fan boys). Truth is this is just too risky of a space for most people, and that ain't gonna change in 2022. I doubt btc will still be around by then. Blockchain sure, but btc and all these other shit coins? Very doubtful. ",
