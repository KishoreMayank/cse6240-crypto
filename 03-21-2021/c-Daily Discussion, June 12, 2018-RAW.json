Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.  So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim, are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Hal Finney",

Is this adress that I send bitcoins to dynamic and so once funds arrived they knew it was send by me?    \n\nI can't really wrap my mind around how a merchant verifies from where payments come from. I gathered this adress they show during checkout is just like their bank account number. i.e The same for everyone. Only with a bankaccount number, when you accept payment you can make people add additional information like order number in the comment fields so they can connect the payment to an order. ",

If positive volume can't eat through this, then we're in another tight trading range. It is probably best to short this, if the trading graph makes one lower-high, followed by a lower-low.  At that point, you're probably not going to the moon without a further retest of 6535.  If it holds above this, as volume really dries up, then another long burst could see the price cutting through 7400-7500 resistence.",

So, I have one of two theories: (1) most probable theory: the whales were waiting for the perfect opportunity to crash Bitcoin and the Coinrail hack is the perfect coverup even though the whales don\u2019t exactly need a cause to crash the cryptocurrency market. (2) The whales were planning on a crash beginning June 10th and the Coinrail hack coincidentally fell at the same time. Also, it\u2019s not crazy to rule out the whales could be involved in hacking Coinrail thus giving them the rationale needed to why Bitcoin has fallen. Any thoughts?",

It is clear to me that next year will usher in more useless, draconian crypto laws and regs that make it not feasible to use exchanges for much of anything except tracking your txns for big brother. By then, I'm sure \"KYC\\-AML\" will include retinal scanning and and DNA, irrespective of how long you have already used the exchange. We all know these laws have everything to do with government attempts to track tax revenue. *The 'money laundering' cover story is laughable; especially when one considers how busted and bankrupt most governments are. These corrupt, disreputable institutions who try so hard \"to protect us\" from ourselves, are flipping every couch cushion, looking to steal your spare change*.\\*\\* So, again, I am looking for a cold wallet that can hold ALL coins. I use Binance for most of my alts (I'm sure that will change soon) and I am sick and tired of having 14 different wallets for each asset: some cold wallets, some desktop clients, some QT wallets, some paper wallets, some online wallets, the list goes on and on.

Even vitalik and CEO of coinbase previously Brian Armstrong apparently called out r/Bitcoin mods for their retarded banning or something. I was like if this is who we elected as our mods for the biggest crypto by far on the biggest community, damn we fucked up horrible showcasing.

Short when you get adequate confirmation, by way of lower-highs and lower-lows, that it can't get through next resistence at 7500.  Short from that point.  Should it suddenly break above 7500, dump the short, immediately, and take the small loss.  If volume through 7500 is high, then go long with another buy on what we'll assume to be a rise to the next established resistance point.  This is never a pure science.  You're just betting the mostly likely odds by knowing the previous resistence or support points and watching for the heavy or light footprints which buyers and sellers leave in their wake.\n",

BTC wasn't used for taxes in 2013-2015 either, and yet the market crash still found a bottom above the previous highs.\n\nBTC is more widely known and understood than in the previous cycle.  The service providers are more robust and reputable (on average).  Institutional custodial services are now available.  Lightning is available.  I see many reasons why the fundamentals are better than in the previous cycle, but I don't understand how you see BTC's market cap heading below $1.7B.  \n\nA protocol that stores and transfers value in a censorship-resistant manner has some value, regardless of whether it's used to pay taxes.  Why is that value now less than $1.7B when in the bleakest depths of the last cycle the participants thought its value was greater than that?",
