For Ledger, how long does it take for a transaction to become \"verified\"?\n\n4. For a paper wallet, if I lose it, I guess then it's all gone right? How can I check the balance in it if I need to?\n\n5. For Ledger, what happens if I lose it or gets destroyed? Can it get corrupted? If I don't have my ledger with me physically and don't have a computer, can I somehow send money  to the ledger with an app? If I lose it, do I just use the 24 word key and then restore it to a new purchased one and I take it my coins will be restored?\n\nSorry for the questions.

Rising that fast after such a major sell off is just not sustainable for another big bull run. I base my trades mostly off TA, which is telling me to go short or just stay away untill it reaches certain key levels. Now on the other hand if you plan to invest long term (let's say 3-5 years), there is nothing to worry about... it will go up again. But some people get stressed when they buy at the peak for the ''long term'' and end up cashing out short term at the worst possible moment.\n\n''Be fearfull when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearfull'' - Warren Buffet\n\nOh yeah, and i'm not a financial advisor.

This caused a lot of systems to automatically set their fees that low, which has created a problem where the \"standard fee\" has become the average, which means that every transaction is pretty much going to take the same general amount of time.\n\nPreviously, Coinbase's standard fee would be way above the average so it would go extremely quickly. You might have to wait an hour or two more now.\n\nThese problems are being sorted by adoption of segwit (which clears the mempool faster and might help us reach a time when we don't have built up transactions awaiting confirmations), the implementation of schorr signatures (lowers transaction size so there's less to clear) and lightning network (which puts a ton of transactions to off-chain so they don't fill the mempool at all).\n\nUntil then, the major problem with BTC is the amount of time transactions can take, and subsequently the fees associated with attempting to get your transactions to the front of the line.",

The Nano Ledger S seems to be a popular choice.\n\n3) You can sell your bitcoin whenever you want for real money. It's generally not worth selling unless you've invested a lot and will make a big return as the future is unpredictable. It could go even higher and you would have missed out. If in doubt, hold as you won't lose any money until you sell.",

If you encrypt the wallet file or the text file with your seed, it's that much more protected.\n\nIf you would be comfortable with that level of security in the case of that text file containing your bank account information, social security number, and a list of your greatest fears... you're probably fine.\n\nIf you want to do this, just locate the wallet file (location varies based on your wallet program... look it up) and copy it over. Or, if you remember your seed, you can do the text file, but I would suggest encrypting it. 7zip has pretty okay encryption for basic users but you can find higher encryption for sure.\n\nI personally use PGP encryption on my seed and I store my PGP private key somewhere else entirely.",

After a triangle like this you often get a sharp move in the original direction (in this case up) equal to the height of the left side of the triangle (11500 - 8600 = 2900 points) from the right hand triangle apex (9550).

            "Text": "Very recently the difficulty got too high and miners switched to mining BCash instead, since it was more profitable. Even so, bitcoins kept getting mined and eventually the difficulty corrected itself.\n\nIf the cost got to $1000USD ... I think many bad things would have to happen for that. However, I also think many miners would still stick with bitcoin mining out of responsibility and because the relative reward would still stay high. Less competition means better ROI when/if the price returned.\n\nYou can also look at what happened to the difficulties during the past few crashes over the years. Bitcoin has seen many \"large\" crashes in the past.",

The spec is not yet finalized and support is still low. I recommend avoiding them for general use for the time being. However, bech32 addresses are inherently Segwit addresses, and that's where the tx fee savings come from. Segwit addresses start with 3. There are a few Segwit compliant wallets, but most are still rolling out the update. [Electrum](http://electrum.org/) is a reputable option. It supports Segwit, and also bech32. \n\nYou should understand that using Segwit is encouraged, but using bech32 might be jumping the gun a little.

            "Text": "1. You need the address of a wallet you control. This may mean creating a wallet on a public website (blockchain.info, maybe? Not a recommendation, just an option); creating a wallet on a phone app (I use and have used coinomi and mycelium; I hear electrum is good too.); or some other service which generates the public address and private key each wallet needs to function.\n\n2. Dunno, never used \"send to a contact\". I would only trust sending bitcoins to a wallet (to a wallet's address, specifically), even if it's a friend's wallet.\n\n3. Ledger or other wallets have no bearing on how long a transaction takes. A ledger or other hardware wallet simply stores the public address and private key of a wallet in a more secure, personal way than, say, a phone app or a public website. Transactions are confirmed when a miner decides to take the unconfirmed transaction, put it in a block, and add it to the blockchain. This may be within minutes or hours depending on many factors, such as mining fees.\n\n4. With any wallet, if you lose it, it's gone. Really get this concept: a \"wallet\" is a combination of a public address (just numbers) and a private key (also just numbers.) It doesn't matter how those numbers are stored, and if you know the numbers you can put them into any wallet app or software and get access to the bitcoins in that wallet. The balance is easy to check: given a wallet address, go to blockchain.info or a similar website and just type in (or copy/paste) the wallet address. The bitcoin blockchain is public and distributed, so everyone has access to the info about every wallet's balance.\n\n5. I've never had a hardware wallet, so I can't answer specific answers about how it stores the keys and such. If you have your 24-word key you can probably recreate the wallet on another device. For me, I was able to move bitcoins from one wallet app to another by using the word-based passphrase, since both wallet apps supported the same recovery format.\n\nThings to google: transaction confirmations; mining fees; wallet addresses and private keys; BIP-39\n\nThings to explore: blockchain.info",

You can get around the transaction fee by logging into GDAX using your Coinbase username and password (same company so same logins) and using their withdrawal process instead, as GDAX have free withdrawals (they cover the transaction fee).\n\nAt the moment transactions are going through under 20 satoshis/byte. Coinbase should be charging no more than a few cents to make the withdrawal to your wallet. If they're charging any more than 50 cents they are ripping you off and you should definitely be looking at GDAX to make your withdrawal.",

Then the cycle starts all over again with this time institutional investors spiking up prices even more in the next round (30-40k end 2018?). Like i said, stick to a strategy. If you are long term, just don't panic and stick with your plan. If you trade actively like me, this was the time to sell off.",

I think it's really lazy when people lump all these \"money go big then pop\" events into a single category.\n\nTulip mania: comparable to the Beanie Baby craze. The rapid valuation of an arbitrary commodity that could be swapped out for any other arbitrary commodity and not affect its fundamental interaction with the rest of the economy or human society. Could in principle become a sort of currency (consider shell/bead money),   but in the event of devaluation there is no reason to stick to this commodity over any other arbitrary commodity.\n\nDot com bubble: comparable to crypto bubbles. The rise of a new technology, method, or commodity that dramatically alters the workings of the economy. Undergoes \"growing pains\" as it is integrated into and revolutionizes the status quo. Marked by a proliferation of mostly worthless applications of the technology in a flurry of exploration into the boundaries of suitable use cases, which mostly fade away after bursts. The industry as a whole goes on to be more valuable than it ever was at peak frenzy. See also: s-curve of technological adoption. ",

            "Text": "I think there's some fundamental differences between the Dutch tulip mania and bitcoin though.\n\nThe tulips were simply a fashion statement - a fashionable status symbol for the Dutch upper class. Bitcoin is fundamentally different because it provides a useful function that the tulips did not; therefore, there is a greater intrinsic value to Bitcoin. The tulip bubble was also a fad that lasted months - hardly the same could be said about Bitcoin.\n\nThe implementation of futures contracts, I predict, will be a good thing. Ultimately, these contracts are just agreements to purchase bitcoins at a set price in the future. The purchaser hopes that the value of that contract at the time of execution is greater than the purchase price, thus he makes a profit. The exchange benefits because they get the money for the contract at the time of purchase, which they can turn around and invest, thus earning a profit.\n\nI don't see how this can damage Bitcoin other than maybe providing some prediction in the prices (based on the contract prices), and it will definitely increase Bitcoin's capital since investors will have a new, big-name vehicle for investment in Bitcoin.\n\nI'll admit that I'm a novice investor, these are just my thoughts I'm bouncing around here. I'd love to hear what everyone's thoughts on this are.",

With former corrections you saw that the buildup was also fast, but nothing like this run. I cashed out most of my mid term portfolio at 10.5k because i saw the madness driving the market up. Then i went short at 11.2k all the way till 9.1k. I made a few small trades on the way up again and currently waiting to go short again when it breaks a key level. When i hear stories on the news of a danish mom buying btc for her sons saving account... i know its a great time to wait on the sideline or take shorts on the right moments.",

Ideally wallet2 is created on an air-gapped computer so as to not be tied to wallet1 in anyway. \n\nIn this 19,000 btc scenario, I'd do groups of 100 bitcoins or use a number generator to pick the amount so it's not the same amount getting washed over and over.

Institutional money can pump the prices up massively but you can expect a correction. Right now, it's safe to say that a $1m investment is a shit ton of money for a tiny market cap of $350B, right? For institutions, they wipe their ass with $1m. Additionally, since bitcoin is \"digital gold\" you can expect the market cap of bitcoin to reach at least $6T in many many years to come. Since it is a world wide store of value, a future $10T+ of the entire crypto market valuation (btc plus alt coins) is not unreasonable. Apologies for the rambling, but in conclusion, speculating that the price of btc when futures goes live is almost expected.",

It just isn't for everyone, as some people i know have tried it and made all the wrong choices/mistakes that they can possibly make. For the average person who is interested in crypto i never recommend day trading. Instead i recommend them investing small amounts of money each month for the longer term (3-5 years minimum). That is after they have done their homework on cryptocurrency and they are behind the whole concept. Investing just because they saw the gains on the news but don't really understanding anything about it is just plain dumb to me.",

The market seems very stretched but bulls can run far. If the 7.9 level breaks we will test 6k level and if that one breaks it's basicly going down towards the 3k zone (which is the long term trendline) so that a full new bull cycle can begin. below 5k people will begin to panic sell.

            "Text": "I will remind you when you're wrong ;). Why would you think it wouldn't be able to hit that level? If it hits 3k, it's still above the main uptrend level. Still a lot higher than the start of 2017. So not unrealistic at all. When btc hit 1k for the first time there were also people yelling it wouldn't go below 500 usd anymore for sure, just google how low it went. When fear strikes and media reports how much it dropped during a normal correction, things can easily drop to those kind of levels. Same as how it can push a coin 1000%, it can easily push it down 50% in half the time (fear moves faster).\n\nAnother beautiful part is that lots of people now yell they will put in all their money if it reaches 6k. Then see a big drop below 6k.... what do you think will happen to 95% of the people? They see their value decrease by 5-10% a day for 1 week straight... and will potentially sell when the fear is getting the upper hand (yep pretty close to the bottom of the crash). \n\nPeople at that stage think btc is dead, gets no more big media attention for awhile... consolidates a bit... and then starts a new recovery and rally phase. I have seen it before from 2013-2014. Allthough i have to mention those phases will be a lot shorter now as the overall attention increases by developments and expanding larger investers.\n\nThe TA's on wallstreet will take 1 look at the current graph and will definatly not step in at current price levels. They too are waiting too buy into a panic selloff \"correction\". Or are looking to short when the bull is exhausted.\n\nOverall i'm bullish on bitcoin, but the market pushed it too high too fast. That's why i think its due for a solid correction.\n\n",

Then i find 11-13k a very good target to sell in. As i don't care to miss out on maybe 10-20% as the risk grows higher for a solid correction on the shorter term.\n\nI'm saying this in every post, on the long term i'm very bullish. Bitcoin won't suddenly die off even if it makes a correction to 3-6K. Only governments can kill a crypto like bitcoin, but just partially. Currently the market cap is way too small for the governments to worry too much. Once we get close to gold (7+ trillion) it will become a whole different story for governments.",
