He compares our latest bubble to the one in 2011.  I tend to disagree and think this is more like the 2014 bear market.  Still, he sees stability and recovery in store for us later in the year.  I think he's right on that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Bitcoin Bubbles - This Isn't Our First Rodeo**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Unless there is another event of equal or greater proportions that occurs in the next few months (like [an ETF getting approved](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-16/frenzy-to-get-bitcoin-etf-listed-is-clogging-up-the-sec-s-email) or a group of 20 countries banning Bitcoin on the same day), I expect the network statistics to stabilize and act as a leading indicator to the price bottom and eventual recovery. My best guess is that this will happen by the end of the year, or possibly this fall if we're lucky\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4188683-bitcoin-bubbles-first-rodeo](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4188683-bitcoin-bubbles-first-rodeo)\n\n(6 pages)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n -[Hopium Time Archives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/)- ",

Plus, even if value rises and the business does well, its still a lot of extra accounting work, and bureaucratic bookkeeping to deal with an entire new currency (especially since, like it or not, all taxes and costs paid to govt, must be paid for in fiat).\n\nNot to mention, everyone who has the ability to pay in bitcoin, also has the ability to pay in fiat (the reverse is not true).\n\nSo other than the novelty of accepting bitcoin (which might appeal to some businesses because its unique or \"fun\") there is really no good reason to accept bitcoin, and lots of solid reasons to not accept it.",

I mean just go and buy it directly on an exchange. And btw let's say that bitcoin hits 50k and you only have 5k to buy bitcoin. If you plan to buy an etf it would literally be imposible, you would need 50k to buy an etf, you cant split one etf into multiple smallpieces of etfs.\nI think it's a stupid idea and bitcoin success doesn't rely on this etf thing,\n",

And a lot of shilling.\n\nBut that aside; speculation, by definition, concerns what may happen in the future.  And if on balance you regard the technology represented by BTC as valuable technologically, socially and financially, then you buy into it.\n\nIf it were *certain* that BTC would be at 25k at the end of the year - then of course it would be logical for everyone to buy it, but then it would be at 250k instead :)\n\nI bought in quite a while back, because I looked at the tech., and decided that it was new, and clever, and since you can't disinvent things, it may be worth a punt.\n\nOn the same basis I have invested in other technologies that pass various tests - I hope they'll do as well too.  But of course there is no guarantee of anything.\n\n.\n\n^edit: ^I ^added ^stuff.  ^Not ^quite ^sure ^what.  ^Will ^stop.",
