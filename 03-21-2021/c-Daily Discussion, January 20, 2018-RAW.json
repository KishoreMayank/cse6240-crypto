We need time to let both new and old investors gain more confidence in cryptos. If it gets there too fast, you should be worried about the weak, excited hands that jump on the fomowagon dumping it at the tiniest sign of uncertainty. We got excited when it hit 12k last night. It's just shy of 13k now. Let Papa BTC get past his hangover first.",

I'm assuming this because the blocks are following each other after like 5 minutes (or even less).\n\nHave a look at the last column:\n\nhttps://btc.com/block\n\nThey can eat away the mempool 2times faster at this rate. The next difficulty adjustment is [~1180 blocks away](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty). If no hashrate leaves, this will go on for a few days and I hope we'll be *way* below 100k unconfirmed transactions from now on.",

Maybe 20 hours or two real world weeks.\n\nIn the context of your post, Dash has a team of developers and marketers as well as other in-house departments. It's a developmental project being ran by traditional company rules. It also has a limit of only 18 million coins being possible. It seems that Dash incentivizes people better through staking and nodes that will inturn benefit the system. It has a simple, brandable name for American and English speaking markets, too.\n\nThe only drawback I can think of with my limited knowledge is that it hasn't been securely tested as well as Bitcoin.",

There's a lot of people investing in Bitcoin, institutions looking into it, it is extremely important to protect the robustness of Bitcoin, because then again, is money we're talking about.

Bitcoin has to be this way, because that's its greatest strength. When a big investors finally moves his or her money to Bitcoin, one of the main things they'll probably think is that they feel safe there's no bribable or manipulable actor in the Bitcoin system. Bitcoin is populism free, it's bribe free, it is influence free...

These guys are marketing pros and if there was any chance this operation is legit, they would have announced it in grand fashion to kill the FUD once and for all. \n\nThe reason they are dragging their feet, not serving US customers, moving their operations out of the US and pretending to be setting up audits by unknown companies from third world companies is because this is certainly a scam. \n\nIt's a scam that props up the price of BTC and makes sure it rebounds every time there's a major dip, so a lot in the community are not going to be interested in calling this out. \n\nIt's like when there's a rotting deep cyst in your face, you'd rather apply some mild topical ointment and makeup and hope it just goes away eventually, rather than taking a heated blade and cutting out this cyst so a full clean recovery can be made. If a doctor suggested cutting it out, you might even lash out at the doc. That's the situation we are in right now. \n\nBut eventually it's going to pop. And it's not going to be an isolated event like the BitConnect pop, it's going to be possibly push us into bear market territory for a long long time.",

I don't see what Bitfinex, which is making an absolute mint anyway, gets out losing their business, being exposed to legal jeopardy and  potentially crashing the market. Also, if Tether is pushing the prices in this way (there are alot, there needs to be given demand and to keep it at a dollar) where is the discrepancy in prices with places that take fiat such as Coinbase?

All you have to do to steal the coins is not sign a previously agreed upon transaction and then broadcast this on-chain calling the claim fraudulent (even if it was legitimate) and you'll be awarded all the coins.\n\n\"Lightning's fundamental technology is a local two\u00ad-party consensus, known as a payment channel. Two parties send an initial amount of Bitcoin into a multisignature transaction with a local consensus on the current balance allocated between the two participants. Updates to the allocation of the current balance can be made only with the cooperation of both parties, using a new transaction which spends from the funds allocated to the multisignature transaction to each party.\n\nOne on-\u00adblockchain transaction is made to deposit the funds into a multisignature output. Before this transaction is made, a refund transaction is created, which returns the original deposit to both parties. After the transaction is broadcast on-\u00adchain, the payment channel is open and ready for transfers. When one wishes to update the balance with a new balance, both parties must consent to the new balance and generate a new spend from the transaction. In effect, they have created numerous \"double spends\" from an on-\u00adblockchain transaction, but have elected not to broadcast the spend until either party wants to redeem their funds on\u00ad-chain.\n\nThese multisignature transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. Either party may broadcast the most recent transaction, the current local consensus state, to the global blockchain at any time to redeem their current balance of funds. As either party may redeem funds from this channel at any time unilaterally, without requiring any cooperation from anyone else, the most recent transaction is effectively their current balance in the channel. They may continue updating the channel with updated states without interacting with the global blockchain until they wish to close out the channel. In other words, updating the local consensus state is actionable on the global consensus state.\n\nUpdating the local transaction state is enforceable via mutual revocation of old states. When balances are updated in a channel, the prior state is invalidated via a penalty system. Only the\nmost recent balance state should be broadcast, which spends from the on-\u00adchain multisignature output. If either party incorrectly broadcasts an old transaction state, the counterparty may take all the funds in the channel as a penalty. As a result, both parties have a direct economic incentive to only broadcast the most recent transaction state. This is achieved by having an on-\u00adchain dispute mediation window before the funds can be dispersed. The global consensus state, the Bitcoin blockchain, becomes a dispute resolution system for off\u00ad-chain local consensusstates. Similar to how the vast majority of legal contracts are adhered to without going to court,\nthe balances in the channel are agreed upon in the off\u00adchain local consensus state, and have the option of on-\u00adchain programmatic enforcement. \n\nThe innovation of the Lightning Network is the use of time\u00adlocked transactions and cryptographic nonces to allow many two\u00ad-party payment channels to form a connected network where payments can be sent over many channels without trusting the intermediate nodes. The topology is similar to IP networks like the internet: packets are routed over many physical links, and the communicating end nodes don't worry about the route as long as data gets to the destination. This works via a decrementing time\u00adlock that permits every intermediate node along the routing path to accept funds only if they forward it along to the next participant, using disclosure of preimages of cryptographic hashes. In the Lightning Network, nodes are not able to seize funds traveling through their channels even if they fail to forward payments or refuse to perform any actions. A node operates without custody of third party funds, which is enforced by a time\u00adlimited cryptographic script. This is all achieved off\u00ad-chain assuming cooperative parties, and enforced on\u00ad-chain when one's counterparty is not cooperative.\"\n\nRead: https://lightning.network/lightning-network-technical-summary.pdf\n\n> As for an exaggerated benefit, it doesn't currently fix scaling issues. If we want the world to adopt lightning it's going to take 40+ years just for everyone to have a single channel opened on the blockchain. That means we need channel factories (another layer) but that means another 2+ years of development.\n\nOpening a channel is a transaction. Let's suppose that a fully optimized block (SegWit, etc.) can contain about 12,000 transactions. That would be 12,000*6*24*365= 631 million transactions per year. One for every human would be ~14 years, assuming modest population growth. During that time we can expect blocks to grow to contain more transactions as well, although that should only happen after the block are fully optimized and the maximum number of transactions are consistently moved off-chain to LN or other L2 networks.\n\n> Another down side is that lightning may not even happen, according to Elizabeth Stark (Lightning's main developer) lightning will be released on 14th June 2016 at the latest. Did that happen? All their promises that it'll be soon fall flat so I've personally lost hope.\n\nIt's being tested now on mainnet. It's still \"beta\", but then again, so is Bitcoin. Production LN will be fairly common in the next few months.\n \n> Thanks for asking me though, sort of fed up of just being accused of FUD without the person being willing to hear what I have to say.\n\nRepeating someone else's talking points without understanding them is FUD, even if you didn't know they were wrong at the time.",
