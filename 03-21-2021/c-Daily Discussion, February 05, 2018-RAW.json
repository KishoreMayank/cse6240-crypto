            "Text": "Anybody who has or is planning on investing in crypto at this point, keep in mind that at least 90% of what you read (especially here), whether bullish or bearish, is often baseless speculation and as some one who's lurked for a while, many people commenting here and in other places are very emotionally invested in bitcoin (or \"competing\" cryptos), and I personally would take what people say here with a grain of salt.\n\nThat being said, here's my two cents on all this. Feel free to disregard.\n\n* Make a strategy now if you don't have one (preferably before you invest). Lump sum or monthly investments? How much? When/at what price do you plan to cash out (or at least reconsider).\n* Educate yourself, not just about bitcoin, but about cryptos in general, money, econ, statistics, investing, psychology, etc. Know what you're investing in and be aware of your limits.\n* Be aware of the risk you take on by investing. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose. Consider different outcomes and contingency plan. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n* Never panic buy or sell (Having a plan helps here). Wait a week or so and see if you still feel the same way.\n* Consider diversifying your portfolio, whether in other cryptos or in stocks, etc. Again, research.\n* Invest long term, don't speculate or day trade. The volatility (and probably your blood pressure) goes up, you have to deal with trading fees, and the long term benefits over hodling are questionable at best. Make your investment(s) and let your money work for you.\n* Taxes, yo.\n* Be aware of and try to avoid logic fallacies - gambler's, sunk cost, bandwagon, etc. Keep in mind that learning about them doesn't make you infallible (heh).\n* Think about why you want to invest in crypto and exactly you hope to get out of it. Come up with some possible counterarguments and see if you can back up your reasoning. Be honest with yourself here or you're only screwing yourself over.\n\nPersonally, I'm optimistic that bitcoin still has a future and that it will start rising again eventually. I also think that the proliferation of other cryptos is actually beneficial to bitcoin despite the competition, as they help both bring attention to the wider cryptocurrency sphere (causing a rising tide which lifts all boats), as well as encourage innovation, which will be necessary for it to remain healthy and relevant in the long run. As for the possibility of governments outlawing it, I think torrenting is a good historical analogy for how well that would work out.",

Every time people say online that the schemes don't work, dozens of people pop up to say that *they* got their pink Cadillac, or know someone who did, or their mother once worked with someone who did. And the post is down-voted by everyone who doesn't want to doubt that they'll get their pink Cadillac, and the readers are all shamed into sticking with the MLM scheme or they'll never get their pink Cadillac.

Remember the genesis block, \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\". History repeats itself, and people may need yet another financial crisis to be reminded why a universal, censorship-resistant currency is so valuable. It's easy to dump crypto and to shun even the oft-criticized BTC when the economy is ramping up; but wait until there is a downturn, suddenly BTC and crypto won't seem too bad a pick against government-issued currencies.",

Literally is probably similar psychology to people drinking the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid, and wholly irrational. \"Well, I'm in this far, better keep going, people are telling me this will lead to a good outcome because of their experiences\" \n\nSeriously, if you really are one of those \"I want to own as many coins as possible\" people, just create a Bitmex account and start shorting BTC now, then you can have more when this is done. \n\nIf you are one of those \"shit, I lost a ton of $$$ in BTC\" people, then try some leveraged trading and play the 15 min BB and other indicators to dig your way out. \n\nThis market is ripe to short and swing trade right now. For many of us, it is basically the same feeling you guys had when BTC went from 8k to 20k.",

Greed I guess but it felt so bullish until I noticed the mainstream media attention and coverage, and your average Joe talking about it. Then Bloomberg covering it constantly made me feel like we were being set up for being made and example of.... then futures arrived which worried me but still held. \n\nWatching it crash over Christmas with my Dad and telling him we should hold this is normal... but a few days ago it dropped close to our initial substantial investment. So we sold and hedged. But ready to buy back in once we feel that bottom has been hit as we know it will bounce back and it just felt like a sensible move to cash out and hedge in USD until buying feels right again.\n\nBack in the early(ish) days invested $2k at $150 ish p/BTC then panic sold at $580 when it stared crashing. At least I made profit. I remember when it was $15 and when it hit 60 we were like wtf is going on. I was tipping mates 3,4,5 BTC lol.\n\nBitcoin will bounce back. I think it\u2019s being manipulated by Wall Street, the media and hedge funds. \n\nLong live bitcoin. ",

If you bought in at 19K may God bless you lol. Maybe sell and buy back in when it raches like $5K which it probably will IMO. To be honest I'm just a mechanic WTF do I know? I knew this was a gamble and I have faired well from it. I will HODL with the rest of my brave soldiers and can only hope we crawl out of this dark wet trench and onto the steps that will take us to the moon in like a couple months?

Down the line, sure, they come up with a FedCoin. But for now this is good news for BTC, expect a surge fueled by FOMO. It will look similar to crash except going in the opposite direction.

No, it will definitely go up, put some more\n\nMid Nov: Mmm, I have gained like 3K euros out of a 5K investement, that is almost double! Yeeha, put some more!\n\nMid Dec: Wow, I have gained liked 26k out of around 10K investement! 50K, 50K, 50K! Next year I am gonna get a lasik surgery,  probably a hair transplant in Turkey to take care of my balding head, and I will still have some good 5-10K left. I love life!\n\nMid Jan: WTF? I am now only 5K+, should I go out before it it's too late?\n\nNow: I am at -9K, out of a total of 28K investement. That is around 33% loss. Shall I take my 19K out and accept my defeat and leave or wait a bit, risking to lose it all?\n\nI know I am not gonna take your advice, because I asked when I was still 5K+ and didn't do anything, actually even tried a little bit of day trading that dragged me down further. So just talking to myself, like any normal crazy person....",

But right now I exited while I still have a decent profit.\n\nThat's my advice...If you're debating what to do, You can get out, and if the market rebounds, no problem, we get back in.

It takes years and years of testing to get best quality out of your project. The only reason why it's so speculative now is because we now have the internet at our exposure and can gather info much faster than we could in the 90's during the dot.com phase. Plus people want to get rich quick. \nThe best projects will give the best opportunity to investors and many will die too. Projects that can scale and save economies Billions will thrive. I also think when the general public start to USE the technology, we might see another bubble and then stability. \nThe best option is to accumulate and not sell and stay out unless you've made a decent profit. If you sell at a loss and don't come back in then that's a hefty fine you have to pay. \n",

When you see some faux floors, some mini-rallies that fizzle out, some dead cat bounces - it'll be denial.\n\nThat will eventually give way to panic and a final sell off in capitulation.

Certainly btc and the blockchain are not a scam under no point of view, but are those who tried to take advantage of those who ignore the blockchain. Precisely that kind of people are getting their lesson in one way or another. BTC it is a before and after in crypto science and did an amazing job to this generation, as it was before with the first tv signal, or the first radio signal. BTC to the infinite and beyond.",

            "Text": "I'm only tossing this out there because there seems to be a lot of fear and I want to present a contrarian perspective. As always, don't forget: if you haven't sold, you haven't lost anything because 1BTC is still 1BTC.\n\nI am comfortable with USD/BTC exchange rates at these levels and am buying (DCA) starting today and running 7-10 days or so. The BTC/USD exchange rate may go down a little more, but I believe that this correction is still just shaking out the overly-exuberant speculators. There is a real 'user' base reflected in the BTC market cap: folks who are actually buying BTC as a savings account because they don't have access to traditional banking services or are using it for payments because they don't have access to a more stable/useable currency. My firm estimates that 'users' component of the BTC market cap, with an added $10B of hard-core HODL'rs to be about $100B. Based on a circulation of 14.7m BTC, we think $6-7k USD/BTC should be a floor based on fundamentals (to the extent we ultimately know what the full set of fundamental KPI are), and dips below this point represent over-correction.\n\nThis isn't investing advice and you always have to make up your own mind about how and when to invest. If you believe that BTC is facing new opportunities because it has made/is making significant technical advances (SegWit, Lightning fees/Tx times falling) or market advances (more potential users with accounts, consumer mind-share, regulatory progress, major new entrants like Samsung) that aren't priced in yet, you should look toward the end of this year for some solid growth above the current valuation. We believe that there will be more users as the year progresses and more legitimate service providers/retailers supporting Bitcoin as an option. If you also believe this and you don't need your investment back immediately, selling now only locks in losses. If you believe that BTC will dip further and want to take a risk on buying back in at the absolute bottom before the bounce, you can certainly try. Timing those things is really, really hard.\n",

Sadly, the financial establishment has inevitably stamped on the flower that was growing through the cracks in the dystopian concrete. I'm sad - not just bc I lost some $$$$$ - to hell with my money! - I'm sad bc I feel like all the sellers missed the point. We were supposed to hold (or HLOD if you prefer) not bc we wanted to make a quick buck, but bc this innovation represented so much more. It was: Freedom from debt-based slavery. Hope that we could overcome our financial masters. And Belief that we could take back control of our lives.

Of course once it arrives at gdax I want to start investing, however, that \"usd account\" does not seem to be an actual wallet.\n\nOn coinbase it does say \"bitcoin wallet\" so I assume that that is a safe place to keep the bitcoins for now.",

The remedy to the 2008 crisis was quantitative easing, which led to the economy being flooded with cheap money, which led to the crypto bubble.",

Plenty of us are completely underwater because, well, we just wanted to buy bitcoin and were naive about the whole crypto market being massively inflated at the time.

Did you not realize at the point of investment that bitcoin is a volatile gamble at this stage, and investing is primarily with the expectation of long-term gains? \n\nBitcoin grows in bubbles, and it's prone to crashes. If you need more info, I encourage you to look at graphs that show that bitcoin price over the last year resembles each of the previous bitcoin bubbles. \n\nThere is no bottom to how low the price can go. We're all kind of blindly hope (with some hope in statistics and meaningless predictions by \"experts\") that that doesn't mean the end. \n\nWe, the average folk, invest in cryptocurrency because we believe in its eventual potential. If you invested in this for a quick buck, then you're probably going to be disappointed. ",

            "Text": ">or it could just be people buying the crash\n\nI may be wrong but I think that's how bull traps work. In a falling market bears realize that they have to sell so when the market seems to recover by a little bit, bulls buy into it thinking that it is going to keep on going up and that the crash is over, thus falling into the trap.",

If miners become more powerful, they can mine it faster, and then the protocol corrects and increases the difficulty so it's back at 10 minutes. On the other hand, if mining power decreases, so will the difficulty. So if some miners stop mining because it doesn't pay off anymore, there will be less mining power, and the difficulty will drop and keep it profitable for those that keep mining.",

            "Text": "It is still risky, but the price usually moves pretty well between certain indicators (e.g., the 20/80 RSI, or the 15 minute Bollinger Bands). This is because so much of the trading is done by leveraged traders and bots who are all keyed in on these indicators. They really only work differently when something crazy happens (e.g., Italy bans BTC and you are already at the low indicators). So, a great way to play this market is to simply trade the high and low indicators.  \n\nFor example, one way to do it is to just wait for BTC to drop down to like 0 or -5 BB then buy in with 10 leverage on a long, or conversely, wait until it is scraping the High BB and go short.

Spoofers feign interest in trading futures, stocks and other products in financial markets creating an illusion of exchange pessimism in the futures market when many offers are being cancelled or withdrawn, or false optimism or demand when many offers are being placed in bad faith. Spoofers bid or offer with intent to cancel before the orders are filled. The flurry of activity around the buy or sell orders is intended to attract other high-frequency traders (HFT) to induce a particular market reaction such as manipulating the market price of a security.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

But actually one positive outcome is I have become very aware of my spendings. For example, I have realized that I was spending like 200 euros per month on massages (I am a runner, so I get injured quite a lot) ---> now replace that with Yoga, at home!.. I almost ate out every night, nothing fancy, mostly take outs, but easily 10-15 euros per day, I can reduce that to at most 5 euros if I eat at home...just these two changes will bring around 500 euros per month, about 1BTC (at the current price) per year.. And don't even get me started about impulse spending on clothes and shoes, etc...... So the silver lining, no matter how this turns out, I know now how to save at least 10K euros more per year, without being too frugal.",

In the stock market, you can set a dollar amount or percent amount stop loss order. This will sell your holdings in case of a crash. With a currency as volatile as Bitcoin it's tougher to set but it makes sense to do so. My strategy when I do buy cryptocurrency is to put a sell order for a 11% drop once I am up 30% or more. Once my coins drop to that 11% I will force myself to stay out of the market for a few weeks just to observe and then slowly add my money back in.",

So you could take the chance and buy now or take the chance of buying later. But if you just keep waiting then all of a sudden it's shooting back up and you're on a mound of regrets. I think it's smart to put in several little amounts at any time. That way even if you miss the lowest you still got in on the downhill.",

Sometimes you need to cut losses, even when it\u2019s painful.  \n\nI learned that lesson the hard way, two years ago when a stock I was holding kept crashing.  I figured after about 50% loss, I was in it for the long run.  Couldn\u2019t bring myself to actually sell, in the off chance it recovered (it seemed possible).  And when it completely hit zero, I kind of wish I\u2019d have just stayed at a 50% loss.  Lesson learned.  That was emotional investing.\n\nIf your current BTC holdings are still worth thousands at this moment, consider avoiding the same mistake I did.  waiting a few years might not recover the loss.  If we dip sub $1k, you might be wishing you sold at $5000. ",

What is the basis for it to be worth $5000? How about $1000? $100? What is the basis that you think \"$5000 is the lowest it will go\"?\n\nAnd please, when you answer try to look at the actual numbers, not the technology, because you're not investing in patents, you're not investing in the creation of a technology, you're speculating on a particular implementation of a technology. What numbers do you have that would make each bitcoin worth any value? What I mean is, if I pitched a stock to you, you'd rightfully ask me for some information on the company that would support my valuation of the stock (whether that's current earnings, future earning potential, etc). Sure, there is some speculation involved (if I tell you I'll double my revenue in the next year because of X, it's still a gamble that X will pay off) but at its core, you are still relying on my numbers to drive your decisions.\n\nSo, what numbers do you have that says \"$5k is the bottom\"? Could you be right? Absolutely, we're in a speculative market that is driven by believe more than reality, but what's to stop everyone from saying \"fuck this shit, I'm out\" and letting it hit 0? \n\nI am not trying to spread despair, I am just trying to make sure that people who have invested in this aren't ruined because they believed the \"hype\" that had nothing behind it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you have solid numbers backing your prediction of $5k up, and I'm out of my element. ",

But stocks have underlying assets that can be sold off and paid out to investors in the event of a bankruptcy. Stocks also pay you a dividend while you hold them. Thats what makes them an investment. \n\nIf you're about to compare crypto to tech stocks, be aware that that was also a bubble. 95% of tech stocks went under. At the time there was no way to know whether pets.com or amazon would go under. Wise investors stayed away. ",

Save for an allowance for transaction cost, you should not hold on to an investment just because you've already bought it. You should only hold if you believe that it will increase in value in which case you would, therefore, buy in even if you did not hold any at present. \n\nHolding onto bit coin because you've already made a loss is equivalent to doubling your bet because you've folded (you obviously aren't making a new investment here - but you are choosing not to withdraw capital that you could withdraw).",

            "Text": "The moving of something between markets to take advantage of the local price differences is called arbitrage, and in some cases it's a way to make money.  Probably at the scale you or I are trading, moving BTC between exchanges fast enough to take advantage of the price differences would be difficult.  \n\nBut to answer your question: Yes.  You can move BTC into and out of exchanges if you'd like.  Some, like GDAX for example, even pay the transfer fee for you.",

Have you ever read the whitepapers? \n\nWhatever you're reading, is all pure speculation. That's why it was so stupid to read all these articles that contained zero facts about \"Why BTC would top 30k by end of 2017\". \n\nA friend posted this on Facebook and it was probably the best assessment I'd read that was trying to cool people running with FOMO to get a Coinbase account and thought BTC was going to start the revolution.\n\n\"Fiat currencies aren\u2019t \u201cbacked by nothing\u201d. they\u2019re backed by militaries that enforce international claims and police forces that enforce domestic claims. As long as a state demands taxes be paid in its currency, that currency has an underlying value: the value is that it buys your freedom from imprisonment for tax evasion.\n\nIf you\u2019re betting on bitcoin **because you expect it to displace national currencies**, you are betting on a far more massive revolution than the emergence of a new asset class: you are actually operating on a theory of (at least partial) state collapse. \n\nThe problem is that bitcoin relies on a stable physical infrastructure and contract-enforcement regime, which are the products of a functional state, and require constant maintenance and funding (in fiat currency). I also see no evidence that bitcoin can actually operate functionally in a context where a state has determined to interfere (by blocking network access to exchanges, by demanding transaction/identity data from exchanges, etc).\n\nSo that leaves me struggling to envision a future state of the world where bitcoin is a stable exchange medium and not simply a speculation that everybody always needs to dollar-reckon to assess.\n\nBut I said this at $100/BTC so whatever\n\nBe careful\"\n\nThe counter to this is that blockchain technology is very exciting. Smart contracts are exciting. It's great technology that also has a single popular coin. I don't think *trusting* ought to have ever been in the vocab unless you were talking about the tech or the network decoupled form the monetary value. \n\n",

But from my experience the general case is that the less money you or your family has the more likely you are to have the newest phone or flashy merchandise. Whereas the richer people I know (who aren't like riiiich but they're definitely more than a couple steps above the general population) all would rather save it and spend it on eating healthy or hobbies and passions or something that will have a return. \n\nMy families probably pretty in the middle. My dad jumps at opportunities to ski and take an amazing vacation and will spend extra to get into a diet or something. But as soon as I ask for a new phone it was \"I'm not paying for that so figure it out\" and \"you better put a case on your 5 year old phone cuz I'll break you if you break it\" I'm definitely not complaining thought because I've learned a lot through that and am glad I don't put myself in money struggles buying useless shit that I'll throw away when a better one comes around.",

Companies are making a lot of money and with the tax cuts, will likely make more. The recent sell off is completely normal. The market is over valued and the quick increase in yields caused a sell off. This is normal. The fundamentals are still in line and companies are making money. QE is being wound down which will have its growing pains.\n\nThe BTC run up was FOMO. People saw it as a way to get rich and put their money in it. A small % of BTC holders are invested for the altruistic reasons of \"sticking it to the man.\" It is mostly people looking to get rich otherwise, why care about the price at all?\n\nI put a little in just in case the hodlers are right.",

Mostly because USD is backed by oil and and Saudi's oil industry (aramco) just broke the deal that Kissinger made decades ago where they agreed to receive US protection as long as aramco sold crude in USD only (forcing other countries to buy USD). \n\nWell guess what? no more. China just bought crude in yuan. No more deal. Have you been reading up on the Saudi family situation? \n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/deutsche-bank-end-of-fiat-money-2017-11\n",

And when people were maxing out credit cards and thinking of taking out mortgages to get in on that nice \"dip\" off of the high I said that was a terrible, horrible, no good very bad idea - and was dismissed as being hopelessly unawares while countless others dragged out charts proving how this happens every January, like clockwork.\n\nMercy is telling it like it is.

If you want my opinion keep reading. \n\n I truly believe some form of crypto is going to become a currency. Bitcoin is the strongest most decentralized right now with the best team behind it. I really think it is has the best chance at becoming if not a coffee buying currency then at least a store of value to hedge against the dollar. I am not an economist I only took a couple of courses but in my opinion we haven\u2019t seen the effects of the stimulus package and all the money that\u2019s being printed daily. I don\u2019t think anyone here on these subreddits has definitive answers either way on whether bitcoin succeeds or fails. I\u2019ve tried to read both sides arguments and haven\u2019t seen anything that convinced me enough to sell. So I just simplify my reasons to one word -hodl. Thanks for your time ",

Too many Redditors believe that every dip has been followed by a rise, which is not true. This is likely because the US has had an amazing past 150 years, people are under the impression that this always happens.\n\nWithout the improvement in technology, you\u2019d see many other countries never recover from crashes either. Countries like England and Spain are undeniably less important than they were in their golden ages, and will never be so again.\n\nPattern matching against past similar looking lines isn\u2019t a good way to predict things. You need to make your predictions from understanding what moves the market. Floppy disks, CRTs and desktop PCs aren\u2019t in a temporary dip either.",
