Bitcoin pulls out his massive green dildo.   It\u2019s an amazing sight and it shuts everyone up real quick. He usually waits to whip it out when all the newbies decide to sell at the bottom.

            "Text": "I'm finally able to pull the trigger on investing.. i was going to do it 1 month ago when it was around 10-11k. Regardless, i am finally able to invest after  wanting to for so long. I'm investing 3k atm. I'm not sure which place i should go to do the transaction. At first I was going to do Coinbase because apparently it is easy but now people are telling me to use gdax. Then when i opened this thread some guy said he is transferring from gdax to gatehub. I never even heard of that. So now I'm just asking for advice.is it fine to use CB if I'm not really all in on btc? Its not like I'm day trading and constantly switching my coins to alts and trying to make a profit everyday.",

I lost a decent amount when I first bought in a few months ago but I stuck with it as I loved the tech behind BTC. Obviously, I've been rewarded generously since then.\n\nNow that I've been learning more about other cryptos, it's hard for me to see BTC's long-term potential as a bright one. There are other cryptos that are faster, fee-less, miner-free, and don't consume a ridiculous amount of energy.\n\nI personally don't see BTC's value anymore, now that I am aware of other cryptos that can do a lot more than BTC and still maintain a high efficiency rate.\n\nI still have much to learn, but this is my personal opinion about things.",

I live in argentina and am currently using ripio, an argentinian based wallet, and it is awful. Maybe i just can't tell well because i'm inexperienced but i've grown to dislike this site a lot. Their fees are rather high, their support staff takes ages to respond (it's been three days) and they only allow you to trade in btc. Whatever advice you have is welcome.",

L-I-V-I-N (or trying to) in the fasco-communist U.S.S.A still, if that means anything, without a VPN/proxy at the moment.\n\n2: What is a good VPN/proxy combo, if needed? (For ex: HMA vs. Vshield vs. others) Tails? How does T O R work? Had a friend who was into this stuff and saw some markets and other functions of such years ago but haven't seen or spoken to that person in almost two years. Read a redit post or two dated from years ago about ripping out hard drives and finding a LinuxOS computer and using other wi-fis and opening browsers while not connected to the internet, is any of this still necessary or have there been improvements since? Eli5 this semi-newb longtime lurker.\n\n3: What are/is a good hard cryptocurrency wallet(s)? (For ex: Trezr vs. Ledgr vs. others) Not all coins this user is interested in are currently shown to be covered by either of these two main wallets, so if they are added later, will it be through a patch via software or will this user need to buy a new hard wallet (trying to avoid planned obsolescence here)? Eli5 the pros and cons of each iteration of each of these wallet companies please.\n\nHere are the coins this user is interested in HODLing in no particular order of favor or importance: D A S H, M o n e r o, N E O (read something about accumulating G A S with it, what is this process?), V e r t, V e r g e, C a r d a n o/A D A, L T C, and B T C proper, to name a few.\n\nBonus question: Looking to buy a new computer soon, recommendations with such questions/activities in mind? Laptop vs. desktop? Retailer vs. build-own? Any particular parts or functions if building own or looking in stores to watch out for and why?\n\nThanks for reading.

I do all my buying and selling through GDAX now to save on fees. After I buy/sell, I transfer to my Coinbase wallet. That transfer is instant and free. Also Coinbase has a decent app so I can check my investment on the go. When you want to get more altcoins or get more involved, you'll probably want to use Kraken and Binance or some others. Coinbase and GDAX are great to wet your feet. \n\nPS. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.",

It's gone basically vertical on the year chart when looking at the growth this month. \n\nEVERY time Bitcoin did this much growth this fast it collapsed afterwards. I believe that'll happen with XRP once BTC starts rising again in January, but it's getting uncomfortably close in market cap to BTC IMO. So I'm just sitting here concerned it'll cause Bitcoin to plummet if Bitcoin falls to number 2 in market cap.\n\nHmm",

I checked this many times so it wasn't a one time error or a failure to update from the website. The price to buy is always over 18000 ARS greater than their selling price. That ammounts to between 900 and 1000 dollars of difference. If that is a common practice for btc exchanges then i don't want any part in them.",

            "Text": "I also have a lot of doubts about Bitcoin's long term potential. I have a feeling it may wind up being like Yahoo.  It has a huge valuation and is doing well now because it is an early leader in this space, a lot of new investors are uneducated and its kind of all purpose in nature but it has its problems (such as scalability and the ability for the community to make decisions without hard forking all the time) and I'm not sure how long it will take to address or if they will ever be adequately addressed.  Meanwhile there are a lot of strong competitors with varying strategies, teams, and focuses e.g. storage, identity, apps, currency, as well as protocol and so I suspect we'll eventually see the Google, Amazon etc. emerge over time and maybe like in Internet space we'll see regional powerhouses as well.",

Binance is pretty easy to sign up for and trade. All i did was deposited some LTC into gdax through my coinbase wallet and themn sent to binance fee free. Then converted it to BTC and bought ripple ,monero, dash and zcash, iota. Majority of my crypto investment is in BTC safely put in electrum.i also am not touching ETH investment as well. Felt good to diversify :) so yeah if you want to trade some eth or ltc for ripple head to binance.\n\nBtw i got my trezor yesterday to which i will be moving my btc,bch ,eth and ltc ( ltc at this point is small investment) o dont know why the founder guy sold all his . So much to learn now about making paper wallets for alts.",

Transfer the Coins to Coinbase (wallet) which is free, so I can see my balance on the go. I like to know I am up $10 or down $10 rather than down 1% or whatever. \n3. When Trading, I send the Coins back to GDAX to trade/sell/buy. All of that is free on GDAX until you reach a certain volume\n\nYou can also transfer from GDAX to other exchanges for free, depending on the exchange, there may be a fee for trading to XRP or whatever altcoin you want.\n\nSince I can tell you are new, start with GDAX. You will learn fast. Then feel free to do whatever after you do your research. This sub is pretty good for learning.",

Imagine that you can do what bitcoin does, with everything that can be digital (certificates, programs, contracts, data, etc..), in various other ways (different blockchains, holochains, tangles,hashgraphs,etc..) with various specific use cases and advantages (some are fasters, some are specifically for crypto based loans, some work with smart contracts, some provide turing complete programming languages to develop on their chain...\n\n---------------------\n\n- That said, I'm willing to acknowledge that currently **to someone living in a first world country, Bitcoin feels just something like a Bank wire, Visa or Paypal,** that works without a Paypal in between and at the moment *Bitcoin* is now even slower and pricier than other services for certain use cases (while still superior for others and other coins can compensate the deficiencies).\n\n***BUT***\n\n- (Just as example) Paypal is active only in 19 countries\n\n- Almost half of the world population doesn't have access to ANY KIND of banking and financial service, while many others have huge problems (think what a Crypto based loans service could do, etc..)\n\n- Oppressive government can monitor, freeze or size any funds of anybody, as well as monitor and deny access to banking services, some do just of suspicions.\n\n- Most of the world currencies is not stable or reliable, even with its volatility, Bitcoin is better than currencies in countries with unstable government and economy.\n",

Then I can send the X btc using the same channel to Binance.\n\nIt basically looks like I'm just sending X btc back and forth, achieving nothing, but by switching the recipient, and having a different sender, I'm actually shuffling it around exchanges.\n\nIt LOOKED like I just sent X btc on that channel, later got it back, then sent X btc again, but it's all different transactions. When I send X btc - Binance now has it, and when I \"get it back\" when I bought X btc again, that's from Coinbase even though it's the same channel, then I send it out, but it's to Binance again.\n\nOf course, that makes sense for me who keeps a lot of coins on different exchanges, I just use the same channel to shuffle across them.",
