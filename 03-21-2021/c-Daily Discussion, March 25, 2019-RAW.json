Test bottom a second time to find support and confirm bottom.\n3. Break above 20 weekly moving average and test 50 weekly moving avg. Only to be rejected.  \n4 have a false break down and have a golden cross getting above both averages.\n5.  From first time finding market bottom and golden cross needs to be a significant amount of time (250-270 DAYS).  \n6. Follow the break out and final capitulation candles have to have massive volume.\n\nIt is critical we confirm the bottom at least twice and this phase happens over a extended period of time.  This allows for the mentality of moon boys vs whales and weak hands selling to stabilize.  \n\nSo if you thinking we're going to 10k in a month there's your dose of truth.  Crypto winter is here to stay for awhile. ",

They'll be the ones causing the first big green candles on the way up because they're borrowing all this BTC that they're dumping.  In the meantime, buy the dip and chill.  All is good.  \n\nIf you're buying Bitcoin because you want more dollars next month or next year, you're doing it wrong.  This is something we will be spending in a couple years.

A lot of negative catalysts are in the rear view mirror or baked into the price. Imo the halving taking Bitcoin from 3.6% to 1.8%- an inflation less than the Fed Funds rate is insanely Bullish and not priced in at all.\n\n4. An extra one to add on, Jerome Powell has no clue how to run the Fed, he predicted 3-4 rate hikes this year last October and said last week no rate hikes at all, I have zero faith in his ability to forecast the economy and that bearish for the Dollar.",

So, for instance, a bunch of might think \"the Mt. Gox sale will drop the price by $200\" (or whatever), but the actual effect is to drop the price by $250, and a bunch of those people think \"shit, I got that wrong\". So they quickly sell and the price drops like another $250. Or they think \"I got that wrong, but not too much\" and they hold. There is no way to know in advance.",
