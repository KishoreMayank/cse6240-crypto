Yea, go ahead and bring in some bad news, and we'll fit it into the narrative, and drop the price some more.  Even with age old, legitimate, markets that are influenced by hard data, people still don't need a good goddamn reason to send the price plunging, or soaring to the sky.  I'm not saying hard data doesn't do it's thing, it doesn't hurt to have it reflected in the price, but it isn't necessary.  You're mentioning of the nonsense, which is correct, and reflected in my opinion above, is, in itself, just more nonsense.  And that's OK.   I guess we needed to break a certain number of comments today or you needed to \"hear yourself talk\".  So you posted some drivel.  I responded with some drivel, in kind.  There's little else to do at this point. It's a waiting game.  The planchette will start to move above a crawl at some point, then it'll walk.  People will barely even look up when it's walking.   Then someday, it'll be off and running, and everyone will be on fire, waiting for the sprint to the mainline.  People will be shitting themselves, some happy, some sad, some living to tell the tale with neither loss, nor gain, having ventured nothing.  So the cycle goes.  ",

I'd like to think there's far more of us who are realistic in the whole mass adoption time. That's not happening overnight. I see no reason why there wouldn't be an ETF within the next few years though. I mean bakkt and Fidelity are fairly certain to happen, so an ETF doesn't seem all that much of a stretch from those platforms.",
