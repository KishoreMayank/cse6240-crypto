Otherwise anyone selling now must have bought in when the price was low and are taking profits. \nSo what? Bitcoin isn't going away or anything lol. It's going through a phase and right now, and nobody knows how to treat it. SEC say it's not a security and yet people treat it like an investment. Its hard to view it as a currency in countries where the money system works at least 'enough' that we aren't switching to Bitcoin/crypto YET. \nBut we will figure out how to deal with Bitcoin once we really define its place in society. It will almost certainly evolve and increase in terms of adoption and certainly in price.\nWhy would anyone have expected the price to move any differently than it is? These things take time. But look around the world at growing crypto infrastructure and how crypto is solving real problems. It has to take more time but it's coming so no need to rush. Countries don't regulate ponzu schemes, so FFS people stop being so naive, stop calling it a scheme, let the 6 monthers and year long investors piss in their pants and sell at a loss. Let the early investors take their profits. Let time do its job.",

I blame Saifedean Ammous and his book \"The Bitcoin Standard\" for this; without the solid understanding of the true promise of Bitcoin his book provides, I probably would have capitulated and bought a really nice guitar with my profit.

It's being manipulated, in my opinion based off the articles I've been reading on here. Now is the time to buy, it might go a little bit lower by the end of the.month but I doubt it. It will end june I think in the the range of 5975-6030 per btc, then go up like 700 and come back down to meet the next expiration for July. Best thing right now is buy low sell high. Use futures as a basis for when to buy.",

It's pretty crazy how close the movement matches up.\n\nWhat's even more interesting to me is that the very technology that allows the pattern to move 5X faster in the Bitcoin market cap chart is basically what the \"dot-com bubble\" time frame in the first chart reflects - The internet itself. The internet has increased access to information & all other data so technology now evolves at an accelerated pace. What's positive for Bitcoin if it continues to follow this pattern at a 5X rate, is the next phase. :)\n\n**Nasdaq Composite Index(showing the Dot-com Bubble) compared to the Bitcoin market cap:**[https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1\\*rid1Vl\\_iP29rbxww2PV1cw.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rid1Vl_iP29rbxww2PV1cw.png)",

If we get a failure here and start trading into the fives 6000 is going to become a major resistance. ...at least to all the technical traders and there are quite a few of them in this market",

Imagine an auctioneer is looking in your window and without you noticing he is listen to your conversation and hear you say how much you value a photo and you are willing to pay anything for it. So that auctioneer tells his buddy \"hey this guy likes this photo and is willing to pay top dollar for it\". \n\nSo they start the auction with the picture already over priced and they see you put your bid in, now they know you are willing to pay anything so one auctioneer acts as a bidder and is always bidding higher than you until they feel you are losing interest then they sell you the over priced painting.\n\nSo whales do the same thing they look at all the shorts and long and they manipulate the price so it goes up and people lose their \"shorts\", and when people see the price going up they start buying in, and they start putting long positions. \n\nI bet if we stop betting on bitcoin it would skyrocket because everybody would benefit from the price increase, but when we margin trade some benefit on the price to be low and some high, so until then Im buying the dips. Its not the whales that is hurting bitcoin it MARGIN TRADING.",

Yeah, some businesses have and more will as a gimmick to attract a few more customers, but widespread adoption is unlikely. Much more likely is that the governmental currencies will move to Blockchain or something like it -- paper money has been on the outs since credit and debit cards started to become popular.",

This is the exact question I was about to ask to gain more insight from other redditors here.\n\nTBH, they can sell what they seized and I wouldnt be surprised if one day we would come to know that the opening of those future exchanges towards btc, while not holding any physical btc to counter these contracts were also part of that move, its the old game of warping the asset base via future contracts, done on the LIBOR, Gold, Oil etc.\nPeople without the knowledge above succumbed to hedge their btc via futures, where at one point in end of January the futures became the leading indicator for both human investors and algo alike. The initial cost *and* margin calls of those contracts are arguably paid in liquidated btc fiat money.\n\nSo there you go, I truly think that government is manipulating prices via exchanges and im sure this is not the only tool at play.",

If this inverse head-and-shoulders we have tracing out right now actually has a bull break it needs to go through that number pretty hard to get the technical traders onboard. If we drop under 6,000 and retest 5800 and go through that 6000 is likely to become resistance.. from there it is somewhat unpredictable where the market will find support. I would be in the wait and see camp. It could crack lower or it could whipsaw and just run traders in. \n\nAccumulating for the long-term make sense at this price. I mean we are 70% off the high.

I'm tired of getting bullied at school.  Even my philosophy teacher thinks you are a cunt, with your 'retrospective analyses' which he says are 'the domain of those who can't stop stating the fucking obvious in a vain attempt to appear wise.'  P.s.  I'm sorry Dad, but I've set fire to your garden shed, so you can't fuck Mrs Jones from next door in there anymore.\n\nLove Billy.",

So much mindless shilling for a speculative internet token from people who have little to no clue what they're talking about. So sure Bitcoin will be worth $100,000 eoy! \n\n...oh wait you meant it only applied to people who didn't mindlessly praise bitcoin. Woops :)",

Bitcoin will not be replaced anytime soon, simply because it has proven its network is stable and secure and it's been tested for 10 years...under the heaviest load that any crypto has endured. \nYou don't replace that, you upgrade it. Layering technology and inovation will nurture Bitcoin well into the future IMO. The internet wasn't replaced ...it was improved! Same with Windows, Apple, Amazon etc. They evolved.\nI guess that's more agreeing than debating but I've been following this a long time and I'm pleased to see that people like yourself are reason to believe that opinions are becoming more educated.",

You get the point. Of course Bitcoin can't work as a currency yet! Most average people never even heard of Bitcoin before a year ago!!! People really need to grasp the time it takes for adoption.",

            "Text": "> Bitcoin is deflationary and as such horrible as a currency.\n\nThat's the viewpoint of the Keynesian school of economics, yes. But, it's not some kind of a priori truth. There is also the Austrian school of economics, which contends that a hard currency is much better than an inflationary one. If I understand correctly, this is the school that heavily influenced Satoshi and many early adopters of Bitcoin.\n\nThat being said, it could be argued that Bitcoin isn't truly deflationary, since the supply gets inflated every 10 minutes. On the other hand, the total supply being capped at a known amount seems to be a pretty good argument that it is. Yes, I argue with myself, usually not publicly though.\n\n> Controlling the money monopoly is literally one of the most important pillars of government power.\n\nFor me, this is one of the most exciting things about Bitcoin, the possibility that it will weaken the stranglehold that government has on us all.\n\nBut, I'm no economist or political scientist, I'm just some random guy on the Internet who read a couple of books. I should probably read a few more.",

Trading volume has been coming down for the last 6 months.\n\nThree rallies produced three consecutive higher lows and they all started in the 6k-6,2k region. It was just a matter of time before whiling buyers to dry out while retailers continued to trade their payment-received bitcoins for hard-cash. \n\nThe cycle for bitcoin to be used as a currency is still incomplete and there's no real bitcoin demand that justifies buying it at such high prices.\n\nThen, you have the whalers which control a large portion of the bitcoin liquidity, making them very powerfull people, in the event of a ATH break. Such people are dangerous because they have the capability to manipulate the market in both directions.",

            "Text": "Another way to think about this is:  why is gold expensive and silver (relatively) cheap? \n\nThey're both noble metals.  Both relatively inert.  Both rare.  Both extracted though similar mining processes.  Both can be smelted and turned into coins and jewelry.  Both are used as stores of value.  Both have some industrial and electronic uses. \n\nThere are actually fewer known reserves for Silver.  So why is silver cheaper? \n\nGold is unbelievably beautiful.  It can be made into wondrous and highly sought after adornment.  It has heft - you know it when you hold it in your hands.  Silver is valued too, but it doesn't have that je ne sais quoi that gold has.  Gold is expensive because gold is highly desired - it is highly desired because it can be manufactured into items that people deeply desire.  ",

It's someone who watches presentations by the top devs and gets excited when they hear about atomic swaps, schnorr signatures, and lightning network. it's someone who seeks knowledge and understanding of all the pieces that makes bitcoin work. It's someone who sees bitcoin as a hobby rather than an investment vehicle. It's through this knowledge and drive to understand that makes one realize fiat conversion rates mean nothing. The tech development doesn't care about price. The top devs certainly don't care. Do you think brilliant devs who sacrifice everything for bitcoin improvements  like Dr. Wuille care about price? Many of us are in it for the tech. Many of us don't care enough to tango with the get rich crowd. I'm a special kind of masochist I guess.",

You confuse exchange profit with trade volume (even though you yourself referenced millions in one trade) and you have no vision of the future based on all that's happening in the crypto space around the globe. Yet you think I'm the one on another planet? Classy.\nImage you owned an exchange. 6 months ago everyone became aware of crypto and the surge of volume was huge. You had to block new user signups, scramble to address security issues, higher more staff than you ever prepared to have, and try to maintain a credible rep. Now it's slowed down ...what would you do? Worry about low volume or fix those issues so you learned from experience like smart businesses do?\nRemember.... early days of cars saw speed limits set to 20 mph so they would not spook the horses.

It's total bullshit.\n\nA bitcoin costs roughly 5X what an ounce of gold costs.  IDK about you, but I work hard for my money, and I'm not going to buy something that costs 5X what an ounce of gold costs without getting something for it.\n\nNow - I might spend that on a lavish vacation and enjoy the fuck out of that.  I might spend it on a used car and get some use out of it. I might buy my wife a really nice present and get a happy wife/happy life return.  I might spend it on a few shares of Apple as in investment - and the only reason I would do so is because I hope to get a return on that investment.\n\nNow sell me a bitcoin.  I can't eat it.  I can't wear it.  I can't do anything with it that I can already do with money.  It doesn't give me pleasure to own. I can't display it for all to see.  \n\nSo why would I own bitcoin?  Because it's innovative? fuck you.  I'm not spending 5X what an ounce of gold costs because its fucking innovative.  \n\nBecause it's not part of the banking system?  Please, I'm not a fucking sex or drug trafficker.  The banking system suits me just fine.\n\nBecause of network effects?  You've got to be fucking kidding me. \n\nThe only reason I would buy a bitcoin is because I think the price is going higher.  That's it.  Convince me the price is going higher and I'm in.  Otherwise it's as useful as a beanie baby to me.  \n\nSo it had a good run, and there's enough true believers out there who still think this is some kind of game changer.   But everything bitcoin does (or actually doesn't do because, let's face it, there's still lots of problems here) the banking system has figured out a long fucking time ago. \n\nBut it is useful for illicit trade - money laundering, black market stuff.  I'll give you that.\n\nOther than that. . . it's about the furthest thing from gold you can imagine.\n\n",

Maybe it isn't bitcoin, definitely the safest bet right now, but cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and centralized money backed by faith in incompetent governments will be worthless. You sound young, so you should be able to handle the volatility, why do you think so many people say it's a long term investment. If you can't handle the volatility don't buy it, but when adoption grows, and bitcoin stabilizes, price will be much higher then.",

Gold has physical properties that make it extremely attractive and useful in certain electronic and industrial processes.  Vast majority of gold is put into use, not stored as bullion.  Certainly some people, institutions and even nations do use it as a store of wealth - that that is far from its only use.\n\nOne way in that gold and bitcoin seem similar is it tends to encourage emotional responses to it that inflate its intrinsic value.  I'll give it that.  \n\nThat being said, gold is a commodity and what I characterize bitcoin as is a virtual digital commodity.  There is no substance to it - unlike gold or any other commodity, there is no utility, and no aesthetic quality to it that gives it a value.  \n\nIn fact, because (for the vast majority of users) there is nothing that bitcoin does that money doesn't already do much better, the only reason why I'd want to purchase a bitcoin with money is because I believe someone else will offer a higher price later.  \n\nThe inflationary/deflationary thing is a sideshow.  There's a million investments I can make that aren't subject to inflation.  Sure, I can put my money in bitcoin, I can just as easily (actually, its easier) put it into gold, or pork bellies, or real estate or any number of stocks or bonds.  Or hell, I can buy a CD or put it in a money market account that guarantees not only the deposit, but a rate of return above inflation - try doing that with bitcoin.  \n\nThere is one exception to the fact that money does everything bitcoin does but better, and that's if I'm a sophisticated criminal or have a reason to hide my transactions, then bitcoin has some extremely attractive qualities that make it better than money.   \n\nOther than that - the real reason people buy bitcoin is the juice - it's a really really volatile digital commodity - and with a little luck and timing, you can make a lot of money in a hurry that way.  \n\nYou can also lose a lot of money.  \n\nAnd a word to the wise - there are hedge funds out there - hedge funds with billions of dollars in assets that they can deploy with a press of a button - hedge funds that spend vast sums of money hiring mathematical geniuses to scour markets for any arbitrage opportunity - hedge funds that have developed extraordinarily sophisticated models to identify ways to take advantage of the market.  These hedge funds are going to be way way way ahead of your average trader.  And you can bet your bottom dollar that they've identified bitcoin as a market that can be exploited.  \n\nBuyers beware - these waters are filled with sharks.   ",

The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.\"",

Anything that is \"deflationary\" will never work as currency.  People will horde it. \n\n\"BTW, the dollar doesn't count as money because it's not a good store of value.\" \n\nDude - I defined money for you above.  Here it is again:  \n\nMoney is legal tender, typically the form of coins or notes, but also includes instruments like travelers checks, and also includes demand deposits, other check deposits, and negotiable orders of withdrawal, etc. which in total constitute the supply of the medium of exchange as defined by a government. Gold is not money unless it is minted in the form of a coin and becomes part of the medium of exchange.\n\nIf you want a store of value - invest money into something - money is for exchanges, it isn't for long term storage of wealth.  \n\nAs long as y'all can't figure that out, you'll be totally perplexed about what bitcoin is and isn't.  \n",

Dollars are money in every regard.  \n\n\"If you hold US dollars for 2 years you can lose 5-10% of the value!!!\"  The inflation rate for the last 10 years has been between .1% and 3%, averaging less than 2%.  So no - not recently.  And regardless exactly zero people advocate storing significant wealth in dollars.  There are zillions of alternatives.  \n\n\"I think bitcoin, like gold has a place in the economic ecology.\"  So does blackjack for that matter. \n\n\"The dollar does too.\"  That's good, because, you know, that's how the vast majority of commerce in the US is conducted. \n\n\"I personally think its great to have multiple forms of currency.\"  Why?  \n\n\"I think it's great to have thousands of cyrptos.\"  Thousands of cryptos that will never be used as currency serves what purpose exactly? \n\nY'all haven't thought this through at all.\n",
