It's not ready yet, and I will post it here when the time comes; But here you have a sneak peak in the comments. For the Reckless one:  \n\n\nI've created [https://tippin.me](https://tippin.me) , a tipping service entirely built on Lightning Network. You create an account, and then you have a **link to share easily**, where people can send you whatever amount they want over LN. You can of course cashout what you have received whenever you want. It's sort of a **Custodial Lightning Network Wallet :)**\n\nThis is for example, my personal link to receive micro-payments:\n\n[https://tippin.me/@eiprol](https://tippin.me/@eiprol) \n\nIf you feel like giving it a try, please send me your feedback :)",

Judging from the weekly RSI back in 2014 and the one we have today there is room to go lower.\n\nI don't want to give an explicit price tag but something below the 3600$ we've already seen is likely and that it will happen within the next 3 months.\n\nHere is a detailed chart from the worst week of last times' bear market (on bitstamp btw, on bitfinex it reached a slightly lower price later in the year):\n\nhttps://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#ig12-hourzczsg2015-01-10zeg2015-01-17ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zxzi1gRSIzv\n\nAs you can see the final moments are actually not very different from other bottoms. The difference will be the insane media coverage and doomsday predictions around that time causing stress and fear in all those who invested too much at a too high price and don't know much about bitcoin. Remember that causing people to sell allows others to buy in cheaply and there is no such thing as fairness amongst humans when it is about deceiving others.\n\nIf you are affected by that here are my suggestions:\n1) If you don't know about the halving, the technical side of bitcoin (lightning, sidechains, etc) and you have little knowledge of trading patterns (e.g. bearish divergence): Don't think about bitcoin for the next 6-9 months. Don't read news and don't check your balance every day.\n\n2) Take the time to inform yourself about LN, bitcoin's technical side and - if you are up to it - trading fundamentals.",

Here's the thing -  The market price of Bitcoin got way over hyped and flew ahead of itself, so as would happen in any situation like this, we got a typical pullback. The long-term trend has not changed though, and is still very bullish. The only people worried about an investment in bitcoin are those who for some reason, don't have time to wait for another few years.",

So 38 bitcoins have to be purchased each day for a year to reach 10k. That is very easy in the grand scheme of things. Typically 24hr volume is inbetween 11-20k btc, cut that in half to account for the selloffs... Based on volume alone, we could easily reach 100k per coin within a year of exiting the bear market, let alone 500k-1mil. Just putting it into perspective. Bitcoin doesn't need massive hype to reach 10k. When you just look at the numbers, it makes sense.",

I guess one would have to look at previous down turns in the S&P and note if there's ever been any correlation. I have no interest in doing that, because with all due respect, I don't care :).\n\nBitcoin is a new up and coming tech that provides an alternative to an aged currency system. It provides accuracy in accounting that FIAT and gold could never come close to providing. As we move further into becoming a digital society, Bitcoin will align more with our way of handling financial transactions. \nIf you want consider market price of Bitcoin, and not the big picture, than consider that many people believe that the catalyst for Bitcoin's rise from a few nodes to a global power house blockchain network was the 2008 market crash. \n\nSo that being the case, one could say Bitcoin may be seen as a hedge. Personally, I think it is far too volatile \"yet\" to function as a proper hedge, but the fact remains, it's growing. It's new in terms of being a currency or store of value - ten years is a blip. The S&P is a representation of company share prices. Now I get it, this is a crypto 'market' so people tend to talk markets with the same toolbox of verbiage . But to approach crypto with the same mentality as a stock share is futile. They are different entities.\n",
