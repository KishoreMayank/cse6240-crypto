            "Text": "The head of the Bank of England calls for an end to the anarchy in the markets of crypto-currency\n\nMark Carney said that \"it's time to bring the ecosystem of crypto assets into compliance with the standards that the entire financial system is subject to.\"\n\nCarney, who also heads the Financial Stability Board, joined the chorus of supporters of strengthening supervision over this market after the explosive emergence of new digital currencies that created over $ 438 billion of paper capitalization for the period from March 2, 2017. Also the comment of the head of the Central Bank is made with an eye on the \"roller coaster\" of the bitcoin course, which in the beginning of the year fell by half after take-off to record highs near $ 20 thousand in December.\n\nCarney pointed to \"extreme volatility,\" which, he says, indicates that there is no intrinsic value or external support. According to his calculations, the average volatility of the largest 10 virtual coins by market capitalization was more than 25 times higher than the average volatility of American stocks in 2017.\n\nIn his speech, the head of the Bank of England voiced the potentially useful properties of blockade technology, which underlies bitcoin, but noted that digital currencies in themselves failed the task of winning the status of real money. At the same time, he denied the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating his own digital currency by the Central Bank in the near future.",

            "Text": "As a fellow average investor in Bitcoin, I would say change your thinking. Stop thinking \"Will the price go up soon?\" and think more \"Is this a useful technology and do others think so?\". If the answer is yes, guess what, the price will go up. If might not be $1,000 a day. You might even have to wait five years for it get to a point where you want to cash out, but it *will* go up. Don't wait for a dip because if you miss it, you'll be asking for a dip next time too. ",

By upping/lowering it a penny, you get ahead of all those orders. This works to your advantage if there are a ton of orders for the same price but not enough pressure to get them all settled.",

Sure, at times it may be a human, but if you see rapid, repeated positioning of this nature, it's likely a bot. This kind of scripting causes a lot of seemingly irrational down- and upward movement in price, especially when many bots react to each other's activities. Then add human interactions on top of that. :)",

The player then allows the yo-yo to wind itself back to the player's hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated rotational energy).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

After that it may well bounce back at over 13K, who knows. The volumes are very low right now which isn't a great sign for bullish trends.\n\nI acknowledge the possibility that I might be wrong, but my point is: take your time and see where the price is heading. Don't let fear of missing out (FOMO) cloud your judgement. It's usually safe to wait a little to see trends emerge over a few days' time.\n\nOne possibility is to buy a small amount right now and see how that goes. Once you have a small BTC balance this will help you to learn about how to best send and store it safely. Also, you will learn more about the market once you have dipped your toes into the water and have a stake in the game.\n\nI recently bought a Trezor and a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and they have made trading so much easier, can warmly recommend both of them for increased security. If you wish to expand your portfolio to other cryptocurrencies at some point, hardware wallets will aid you greatly. At first I used mainly cold storage paper wallets, which are pretty good for long term holding but not so efficient if you need speedy transactions, or if you own a number of different cryptocurrencies that you need to keep in order.\n\nStay chill, have fun and don't stress. :)",

In this subreddit, you call most of them shitcoins, but you trust this one. Why?\n\n> it is only important that the market considers this as such...\n\nThe big players in the market are well aware that USDT is a crypto coin worth just as much as the issuing company' word for it. They accept the 1:1 arbitrage for now because it's convenient for them, because they are gambling and because they have their risk calculation done, contrary to most of the people in here. When - or if - the tether shit hits the fan, they will be the first selling off USDT fast as hell. At this time, crypto might spike to the moon at USDT exchanges, and simultaneously crash into hell at USD exchanges. We'll see.\n\nBut hey, yeah maybe Tether really is the multi-billion company they claim to be, without giving any proof whatsoever. Then everything is fine.\n",
