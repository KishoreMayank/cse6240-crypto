Bitcoin to save the day!  \n\n&nbsp;\n  \n\"Less than 1% of the world\u2019s population \u2014 [no more than 40 million people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/) \u2014 have ever used Bitcoin.\"  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust imagine what the price would look like if only 5% of the world started to use bitcoin.  As usage of bitcoin grows we will all begin to truly free ourselves, not just in the third world, but in the first world too.  Fiat currency became obsolete as soon as bitcoin was invented.  The world just hasn't caught on yet to that reality. But it soon will. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>According to Alejandro Machado, a cryptocurrency researcher at the [Open Money Initiative](https://www.openmoneyinitiative.org/), a wire transfer from the United States can now encounter a fee as high as 56% as it passes from dollars to bolivares in a process that can last several weeks.   \n>  \n>&nbsp;\n>  \n>To circumvent this bureaucracy, some Venezuelans have started to receive bitcoin from their relatives abroad. It\u2019s now possible to send a text message to your family asking for bitcoin, and receive it minutes later for a tiny fee. Government censorship isn\u2019t possible, as bitcoin isn\u2019t routed through a bank or third party and instead arrives into your phone wallet in a peer-to-peer way. Then you can, moments later, sell your new bitcoin into fiat through a local [Craigslist-style exchange](https://localbitcoins.com/country/VE), or load it onto a flash drive (or even [memorize](https://bitzuma.com/posts/how-to-memorize-your-bitcoin-wallet-seed-in-three-days/) a recovery phrase) and escape Venezuela with complete control over your savings.   \n>  \n>&nbsp;  \n>  \n>Venezuela isn\u2019t the only place where people can use Bitcoin as an escape valve. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe printed endless amounts of cash and inflated the savings of his citizens into nothing, but his successors can\u2019t print more bitcoin. In China, Xi Jinping can track all of your transactions on Alipay and WePay, but he cannot orchestrate mass surveillance on all Bitcoin payments. In Russia, Vladimir Putin can target an NGO and freeze its bank account, but he can\u2019t freeze its Bitcoin wallet. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[http://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/](http://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n[\\- Hopium Time Archives -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/)",

Nothing but doom and gloom and then \"to the moon\" when there's the slightest hint of a percentage rise. Kind or reminds me of somewhere actually...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2019 is going to be an interesting year. With some luck Bitcoin will actually become usable as a currency. I feel like Bitcoin might never make it though, and is simply in the same field of idealism that Linux has been in for a lifetime. \"Year of the Linux Desktop\" has been a theme for as long as I can remember, and I'd been involved in that seen for over ten years. Although I suppose \"Year of Linux\" did come in the end with Android and Chrome OS. Not how anyone originally envisioned or hoped for though.\n\nI have a feeling Bitcoin could be due for the same fate, and something like a \"Google Coin\" or \"Facebook Coin\" or Amazon, Apple, Microsoft \"Coin\" will reach a higher adoption than Bitcoin and warp the original vision for it. If Bitcoin scene has been any indicator, it is driven by greed more than by idealism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, 2019 is going to be an interesting year. I still believe in the idealism behind it thanks to having read \"The Internet of Money\" by AA. But I don't know how likely it is that Bitcoin itself will be the success we want it to be. A blockchain based currency is inevitable, much the same way Cars replaced horses, the internet replaced the phone network, and electric lighting replaced gas lamps - But much like Edison won out over Nikola Tesla, Bitcoin could fail in a similarly spectacular fashion. It wouldn't surprise me one bit.",

            "Text": "\\[First time poster so please direct me to a more appropriate thread if applicable, thanks!\\]\n\nI was hoping to get feedback on a crypto/bitcoin use case in the credit card referral space. Credit card referrals can offer significant value to the tune of $100 to upwards of $5000 a year. However, most people rarely accrue the full value of their own referral links. Two of the factors that prevent people from actively using referral links:\n\n1. A community to find referral links from?\n2. Incentive for using a referral link over a public link?\n\n1) is somewhat solved from the many travel communities and blogs available online. A compelling reason for 2 ) is if two parties can mutually agree to use each other's referral links. This does happen online today, however, it is adhoc and the parties can't **trust** each other to follow through on this.\n\nIf there was a way for the two parties to stake their personal money as a guarantee that they will indeed follow through on the referral usage, both parties stand to gain. More formally, say A and B match such that\n\n\\- A agrees to use B's referral link and vice-versa\n\n\\- both move x tokens to a common address\n\n\\- both follow through on their promise\n\n\\- both are satisfied with the other's action (A and B get their referral bonuses)\n\n\\- both get x back to their accounts\n\n\\[There are some edge cases here that I glossed over\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this something that makes sense / the right use case for crypto / already being worked on? Where (not partial to any crypto / platform) would you suggest I look next if I wanted to prototype something like this?",

Some questions over here;\n\n\nWhat happens when we reach at those network transactions levels in the future  like MasterCard & Visa if Bitcoin is meant to be a payment tool?\n\nCurrently, it cannot be on the same level as those above, what's your opinions on this one?\n\nIs Bitcoin going to a be \"store of value\" \nOr just an alternative payment money?\n\nAnd the block confirmation time, if we are going to pay for a dish at an restaurant, you're like sitting there and waiting for confirmation for over a few minutes, that's not a good idea..\nYeah; I have heard about the LN, those channels which is needed to accept or receive bitcoins on LN... They are very complicated.... Or????\n",

Fiat is absolutely 100% necessary to produce a functioning economy and society - but Bitcoin can live quite happily in perpetuity as a cherry on top (alongside gold and other stores of value / investment products.)\n\nIn B4 whining about corrupt banks: the problem society has is with corruption, not that central banks and fiat currency exist. Central banks and fiat currency are a vital part of a healthy economy that stops you from starving to death. Bitcoin alone can't save Venezuela, but it can help relieve the symptoms for some until it recovers.",

Plus it is impossible for a coin launched by these entities to have these qualities. \n\nThe situation is simply not analogous to Facebook replacing myspace or similar other cases. Those were services being replaced by other services. Bitcoin is not just a service. It has value due to other unique qualities and not just for being a service.\n\nNow you tell me how a decentralised immutable new coin springs into existence and displaces Bitcoin?

This is why a majority of bitcoin talk is still related to price instead of usability. It's obviously still a speculative investment. Oddly enough, I would like more purchasing options to be in bitcoin because most of my earnings come in fairly illegal ways through crypto. So it's actually more unsafe for me to cash through my exchange for purchases and have to possibly explain that to banks/governments. But I am aware I am a very small minority.\n\nRight now nobody is buying bitcoin so they can buy a sandwich with it. They are buying it as a hedge against inflation in the coming decades, as a hedge against a possible future of corrupt and tyrannical government, and as a belief that this system will eventually develop into a more accepted and practical use of transferring wealth across the globe without an intermediary. It is up to you to decided if any of these other reasons are valid for you to buy right now. But yes, if you don't do anything shady or illegal, there is no reason for you to use it. That's why almost nobody does.",

I go there on weekends and the guy knows me.  I always use Samsung Pay on my phone which he remembers so as soon as the machine says approved he says thanks.  I'm supposed to stand there while it prints the receipt and then sign it and then wait for my receipt.  What's to say we just see the Bitcoin transaction appear which take seconds like my Visa and he says thanks.\n\nIt's just an interesting use-case for an on-chain  transaction in the real world.  I also have a funded Eclair wallet on the same phone with a lightning channel open that is what I'd really like to use in that situation.  But like you said, too complicated at the moment.",

It also can't can't ever replace bank accounts and credit cards. But it can be analogous to pre-paid debit cards and small stores of precious metals.\n\nSome of the barriers are that Bitcoin accounts can't be frozen, transactions can't be forcibly undone, payments can't be initiated by the recipient and keys can't be changed. These are unique advantages of Bitcoin, but it's incredibly useful to have those tools as a banking customers. You can freeze your account if your debit card is stolen; undo a transaction if a shady retailer scams you - and make recurring monthly automatic payments for your bills.\n\nBitcoin does some things well, a lot of things badly - and because nobody's really in charge, a lot of the problems are going unfixed. It needs a centralized brand / app that people can easily understand. Only 5000 people have installed the Lightning Network phone app, the \"hack a node together yourself\" approach feels a lot like early Linux adoption (where Linux basically stayed on the sidelines except in variants like Android.)",

Today it has about 65% of the market. I don't doubt that a company with this kind of leverage could disrupt the market in such a way that Bitcoin could become potentially worthless.

You're missing out on the entire history of money by not understanding this.\n\nThe problem with gold was not ease of transactions, it was that gold was unevenly distributed around the world, was barely adequate for a feudal bargaining economy - and is a paradox: if gold was its own currency, how would miners price and sell gold when it is priced in... itself? If you were an old-timey gold miner, unless you were giving it away - you would need to sell it. So your wealth is going to be in something else, like camels or land. It's the same deal with Bitcoin.\n\nOr another example: imagine one village owns and uses all 21 million Bitcoin as currency. Some children of the village leave and start an identical village across the river but they use banana leaves as currency. Many years later (when populations have stabilized), both villages decide to start trading with each other and standardize on a currency. The bread sold in banana leaves is just as nutritious and valuable as the bread sold in Bitcoin, but what's the combined value of the new economy with two identical villages? It should be 42 million Bitcoin, but that's impossible.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts like to angrily judge governments for printing money, but generating new money as society grows is the engine of wealth creation and is essential for a healthy economy.",

I\u2019d rather bitcoin be priced against real world items such as land and camels than a fiat built house of cards. \n\n\n> The bread sold in banana leaves is just as nutritious and valuable as the bread sold in Bitcoin, but what's the combined value of the new economy with two identical villages? It should be 42 million Bitcoin, but that's impossible.\n\nOne could argue that with the increase in supply of available bread from the POV of the bitcoin village, the residents of the bitcoin village could purchase the bread from the banana village for less bitcoin than would normally be required if buying from their own village.  Banana leaves are not finite as you can grow more bananas, so they are less valuable.  While this is a fun thought experiment I don\u2019t think it applies to any real life scenario.  It assumes all the bitcoin wealth in the world would be concentrated in one group of people.  Obviously this would be a problem. It needs to be distributed among many people to foster a functional economy. \n",
