Look for large BTC market orders to go off one after another in a very short span of time.  A good indication of short term volume/volatility on its way.",

            "Text": "The supposed reason for inflation is that actual aggregate production is about ~2% per annum, supposedly.  For reasons of \"price stability\", inflation is introduced so that the price of goods remains stable with about the same demand even as the supply increases.\n\nThe *real* questions are:\n\n1. Why is price stability even a goal?  Consider that it's *aggregate* production that is about ~2% per annum, but a few industries will have much higher than that while most industries will be less (or even shrink).  Thus price cannot really stabilize, so why is it even a goal?\n2. Who benefits from the 2% inflation, really?  Mostly the ones who print the money.\n3. \"Less incentive to spend today\", benefits who? Those who are *today* selling sugar water and pumping it with stimulants and carbon dioxide to keep you from gagging on sugar water, or those who want to save up their money and start a small business some *future* day?  And which one should we encourage?",

Then the coffee shop can later sell that ETF and convert it to USD.\n\nRobinhood is already interested in the crypto market. It would be simple for them to build a wallet app that lets you transfer ETF payments. \n\nLightning could be used for microtransactions (classified as anything under $1). ETF could be a good 2nd layer solution for larger transactions. ",

On Lightning, every channel through which you might route your funds is anchored on some unspent transaction output that is auditably present on the blockchain.  So you know it's backed by real BTC, for sure, because the channel includes a reference to its location on the blockchain.\n\nWhy bother using an ETF when you can just spin up an LN node and have better auditability over the money you are using?",
