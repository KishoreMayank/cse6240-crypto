In the network payments will flow trought these channels. These channels will be super important for the merchant because they will be their gateway to the network. Will this not lead to centralisation and hubs that will keep these channels open as a paid service (through fees for example)?",

You bought near the high of the month, so you might need to wait a bit for profits. \n\nWhether it goes up or down long term is anyone\u2019s guess, but I think it\u2019ll go beyond 9.8 in the next month or so. It\u2019s not going to zero anytime soon, so you\u2019re not going to lose your money.

There just needs to be some path from customer to merchant that is no more than 20 nodes long. 20 may sound like a small number but its actually plenty (insert graph theory). Some nodes may become very well connected but that does not risk centralization. Such a node could threaten to go offline or charge high fees, but it's EXTREMELY unlikely that you could not find a path to your merchant through different nodes given the 20 node ceiling. Why is it unlikely? Because every individual node has strong incentive to be well connected.",
