I'm taking a risk and putting my fraction of a bitcoin in cold storage and I'm just going to wait it all out if it goes to shit oh well I have only invested what I can loose.

There will always be a delay in this due to pricing algorithms, latency, hardware limitations, etc. (This is just logic resulting from the previous statements. Please think carefully about this)\n\n=> Most consumers will prefer to use fiat more than Bitcoin for payments for the mentioned service/product because it is cheaper to do so.

Most 16nm are 14th@1500w with cost of production at $5,000 in an optimized environment. All these mining outfits that are producing around those numbers are very unlikely to upgrade. That's going to drop the network hashrate and it's going to reduce the difficulty. Guess who benefits from that?",

It was technically way above the average person and had no real use. People who saw the potential said hey let\u2019s build this shit and bring it to everyone. It can do the job of shopping and teaching and banking and .... wait stop there says the pompous know it alls (you)! This is worthless it will never replace mail or any of the nonsense you\u2019re claiming. Now here we are.\nBitcoin can easily serve as a currency and store of value and send millions around the world effortlessly and secure as fuck. But people without the ability to see forward (you) are like no way, this is worthless it will never do those things. If you don\u2019t see where this is going then that\u2019s your choice bro. But don\u2019t be condemning a future that is at least as likely to happen as is to not happen. You don\u2019t have to be all for it but open your mind maybe? .. your choice.",

Now there is a flatter size distribution with plenty of medium-large sized nodes and no utterly dominating ones. The blurry mess in between them all highlights how interconnected they all are; you can delete the largest ones and still get to the majority of the network within 2-3 hops. \n\nSo it's moving further away from a hub-and-spokes model and closer to a more decentralised mesh-like network. Which is pretty cool to watch, remembering that nobody is directing this. Still a few overly large ones but it should keep improving as the network grows. ",

If Bitcoin becomes the digital accounting system for the next generation then the game gets even bigger. Either way it's a no brainer. I'm no sucker but if I got a grand I don't mind losing I'm not gonna have any hangups with throwing it in the crypto pot in the chance it can turn into 10 grand. And I ain't alone in that way of thinking. Life is short and little risk here and there keeps it interesting. Risk is a big industry.",

If you want to play really really good odds. Buy an amount of Bitcoin you can seriously afford to lose. Like legitimately lose. Put it on a hardware wallet and go do something else with your life for a few years. That strategy has been ridiculously effective\n\nOdds of success at trading. 5 to 10%\nOdds of success at what I just said. Ten year history says 100%\n\nCan that change? Absolutely. But what odds do you want to play?\n\nI'm going to mention something that should be obvious but sometimes needs to be pointed out. If you want to learn how to do absolutely anything. Find someone who is really good at it and copy what they do. Look at the people who have made a lot of money in Bitcoin. look at the people who have lost a lot of money in Bitcoin. Choose which one you want to imitate",

My implication is that every investor should have emotional detachment to the instrument and decide when going in, how much loss they are able to tolerate. Every investor will lose all the time, there is no magic method to choose only winning bets, so to limit downside on those losing bets investors need stop-loss, so that the losing instruments don't render aggregate of all the bets losing.",
