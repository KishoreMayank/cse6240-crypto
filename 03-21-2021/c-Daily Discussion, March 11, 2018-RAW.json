            "Text": "I think it's safe to conclude that the recent crash has been far less severe, judging from objective factors, compared with the crash from ATH in December towards the final valley and bounce at 6th of February. This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.\n\nhttps://coinstelegram.com/2018/03/10/the-next-court-proceeding-for-mt-gox-bankruptsy-is-postponed-until-september-2018/\n\n(Credit to FlorianManner for posting the link)\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.\n\nOn the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming weeks. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.\n\nThe question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.\n\nIf the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.\n\nThis is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.\n",

            "Text": "Yup.  Keep banning speech.  That is a good answer.  People that advocate banning speech need to take a step back and think about their perspective.  I wonder if there are lots of other areas in life where you want to ban speech?\n\nFrankly, I find the FUD serves several purposes to anyone with a working brain.  (1) it is funny.  (2) occasionally it makes a great point that deserves consideration.  (3) for \"new comers\" to BTC in general, maybe, just maybe it keep them from investing (or gambling) for a few days - and gives them a chance to get educated before succumbing to exaggerations of getting rich quick. \n\nYou don't like the FUD?  You don't like the comments about the market tumbling?  Maybe you can use your insights to post counter arguments.  Maybe the most compelling argument can just compete to see if it wins out?  (reminiscent of Capitalism anyone?)\n\nBTC and ledger tech in general is terrific.  Is it AI?  No.  It ain't.  Not even close.  But does it carry transformative economic possibility?  Sure.  Will it harken an age of free love and universal wealth?  No.\n\nA \"daily\" on BTC is all about day trading.  It is all about FOMO vs FUD.  If it was a \"celebration\" forum, (a) it would not be daily and (b) nobody would visit.  We are all here, at all hours, seeing which horse is going to get around the track the fastest.  (After which you will still receive your 1099, still pay taxes, and still bear your anti-establishment bent).\n\nSo dear moderators, please ignore bots who propose banning speech.    Because no free thinking human being would propose such a thing.",

I don't gamble, but a lot of my good friends do.  Gambling is a scam that is specifically meant to part people from their money.  Why aren't you trolling gambling forums?  It's certainly a much bigger industry?  My view is that they're adults, and if they want to spend their money that way, so be it.  They're not hurting me.  Don't you think people having the freedom to spend the fruits of their productive labor where they see fit something that we should strive for?\n\n>  Ever get angry when you see the few exploit the many, ruin the planet for profit and steal the future from the next generation?\n\nSure.  It is because of that that bitcoin was invented.  To be able to take away the power of people who do the things you're talking about.  Why aren't you protesting against ExxonMobil?  Or any large car manufacturer for that matter.  Surely you recognize that the effects on the planet of these companies is far greater than anything bitcoin has to do with.  Don't you think it's just a little bit weird that you'll create sockpuppet accounts in order to troll a subreddit that you have no interest in?\n\n> If nobody shares an opposing opinion than how can anyone honestly make an informed decision of their own?\n\nIs that what you feel you're providing?  An informed decision?  Don't you think you'd need to at least understand the subject in order to be 'informed'?  You don't even know what the invention is, or indeed, why it works.  I recommend that no-one at all invest in bitcoin if they don't understand what its value proposition is, and more importantly, how it is going to be be realized.\n\nBut you're not doing that.  You're like a christian trolling an atheist subreddit, and calling everyone idiots because they don't believe in creationism.  You're not providing any insights into bitcoin.  You're certainly not helping anyone.  It sounds to me like you're trying to troll this subreddit in some bizarre belief that someone here is going to attempt to change your mind, *and you're not gonna let that happen goddamit*.  Why would I do that?  I don't care what you think.  Don't like bitcoin?  Don't invest in it.  It's not that hard of a concept to grasp.  No-one is holding a gun to your head.",
