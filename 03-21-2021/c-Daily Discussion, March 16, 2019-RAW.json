He, as an average person in Sierra Leone, has absolutely no access to the global financial system.  Unlike G20 countries where lawyer, doctor, engineer, financier etc are \"bootstrap\" professions where one can work one's way up the financial ladder, the ONLY bootstrap profession available to most people in over 100 countries is tourism.  To demonstrate professional bona fides, Henry wants to enroll in and pass a certification course.  He has no credit card, no access to a bank that will send international wires for him, no access to ACH, no access to SWIFT, etc.  However, he does have and make money.  \n\nPlease tell me exactly, step by step, in excruciating detail, how Henry can acquire BTC inexpensively and pay them, and you will have both made a convert and more importantly given someone an opportunity to reach their dream.

You will find a very strong preference for Bitcoin here.\n\nA block chain, and by extension its tokens, are a means for exchanging value across a network and securing that network against a spectrum of attacks.\n\nHow you utilize that functionality is irrelevant to the network. Your posts suggests you have a new utility in mind that could respond to the presence or absence of a token. I might suggest the following questions to ask yourself:\n\n1-could this be done buy an end-user product. Such as a program that manages it's own lightning node wallet and performs the desired function for a user that sends the specific value to a specific address. In this case you may be able to save yourself a massive amount of work.\n\n2- Am I making an innovation that would benefit the network as a whole. Maybe you can put together a test net as a proof of concept or propose a BIP, or send a theoretical post out on the BTC Dev Linux mailing list to get feedback. Either way, your use for a token would benefit from Bitcoins 10 years of adoption growth rather than trying to start from scratch, and you will find this community a lot more welcoming to someone who tries to contribute to a better Bitcoin than someone who is trying to compete with Bitcoin.\n\nAnd finally 3- Do you understand that you don't need permission. You can build on top of Bitcoin, beside bitcoin, away from Bitcoin. It doesn't matter. Your new token can be just something your friends use to reward beerpong wins and nobody can stop you.\n\nThis community is to rally around our champion and to witness what we truly believe is a revolution of technology. We welcome you to be part of it, but if it truly doesn't satisfy, go forth and be your own champion.\n\nEdit: ;-; it's/its",

Double tops often get broken and tripple tops are practically none existant (which is why the idea of a \"cup and handle\" exists. It's basically a tripple top being broken. The reason this pattern actually makes sense is because when we do reach 20k again, we will come back down but people need to see how far low we go again. If we dont go anywhere near previous lows, people then decide \"ok, i guess it really is valued around 20k\" and then it breaks). So if you held through the bear market, why sell when its about to be a bull market again? Id sell during the start of the next bear market not at the start of the next bull market. But to each there own).",
