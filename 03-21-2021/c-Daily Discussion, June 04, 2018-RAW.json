But he also reminds people who have come for the price that they should stay for the principles.\n\nThis keynote talk happened during the epic one-night only extravaganza at the historic Music Box Theater in Chicago on April 25th, 2018.\n\nThe main event, emceed by Pamela Morgan, was a live recording of the 5-year anniversary episode of the Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin Podcast. All four hosts Adam B. Levine, Stephanie Murphy, Jonathan Mohan, and Andreas M. Antonopoulos were together on-stage for the first time ever. The hour-long episode included the hosts discussing some of their favorite memories over the past five years, what\u2019s happening now, and of course, they encouraged some audience participation. The show was recorded and made available as a podcast on the LTB network. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xIq0FdmsIA&feature=youtu.be",

I know it hasn\u2019t had too much of an impact - Coinbase inconveniently doing maintenance during peak evening hours usually from 8-9 PM (PST) but how is this possible? I\u2019m not familiar with other exchanges like OKEX, Bitfinnex or Bitrex...whether or not they have these periodic freezes to do maintenance but it sounds very illegitimate and unethical. Just because trading on GDAX is paused doesn\u2019t mean the whole cryptocurrency market pauses as well. That\u2019s what disturbs me. A lot of activity can happen in an hour or so. If my discontent for Coinbase/GDAX wasn\u2019t already at its all time high, these maintenance calls really takes the cake. It has already lost me money because prices immediately dive once GDAX is restored. I know GDAX at least gives you advanced courtesy notice but that still is not acceptable. If Facebook, Twitter and Google can all manage without shutting down their websites for an hour (and they don\u2019t affect you financially), then why can\u2019t GDAX manage. Really hating these people!",
