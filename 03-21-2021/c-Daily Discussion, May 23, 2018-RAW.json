If the price watchers amongst us look at the flip side of the coin... we're all a bit cynical when we see a big pump in price. We're expecting that dump. Or least I am. Take a look at this large dump today in a similar view. We'd all surely agree that the price of BTC going up steadily over a long sustained period is a better indication of real growth than a sudden spike. Apply the same to sudden dips. It's not steadily falling in price over a long period of time. BTC is decentralised and so are the sentiments people have for it. IMO, this isn't the end, its an opportunity. ",

When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle",

            "Text": "Bitcoin is the future. I dont care what anyone says. If you look at the way we communicate with each other it has changed over the years. Even how we get information, and how we listen to music, so why is the way we pay for things going to stay the same forever? Its not. I have noticed when people dont understand how something works they say its a scam. But how is being in control of your finances a scam. Its not. So if you are invested in bitcoin for the tech or to get rich well this is your chance to buy more, and if you are looking for the price to go up so you can break even just sell now and save yourself the heartache. #buy the dips #bitcoin is the future.",

Well I sold some a few days ago after refreshing my charts every 5 minutes.... Now you may destroy me with your comments. Why am I being stupid to sell now and buy back at a lower price? For now it stopped me from losing a few k. If I buy back at current rate and it goes back to 8500 let's say next week I did a good job in my eyes...\nThose claiming they got into it because of the technology... don't make me laugh...\nIf you love the technology then take some programming courses and get a job in the industry.

            "Text": "Are you serious? \n\nI'll give you my view on bitcoin.  \n\nIn 2009 when it was worth pennies I was sitting in my college dorm thinking about buying $10-20 worth until my girlfriend (now wife) told me I was an idiot. Looking back at it, we both wish we did. From that point up until about 2-3 weeks ago I never really cared much for it besides checking up on it. \n\nWife wanted to make a purchase with btc so we started looking into how it really worked, got a wallet, bought some, etc. Now that I've dipped my toe in it, what's my opinion of it? It's a scam. \n\nWhy? \n\n* One of the bigger reasons people went into cryptocurrency were to get away from the \"corrupt banks\" but it's no different. Everything you do has a fee associated with it, way more than any bank has ever done. \n\n* Speaking of fees, it'll never be widely accepted as a currency. Buy btc? 3% fee. Sell btc? 3% fee. Send to a wallet? 3% fee. By the time you buy it, send it to a wallet and purchase something you're already out 5%+ in fees and that's not even taking into account that it could have plummeted in the time it took for it all to process.\n\n* Oh, processing times you say? Yea, I deposited money into a broker on the 12th and I can't even touch my btc until tomorrow. 9 business days to be able to use my \"currency\" and that's not even including the time it'll take to actually send it to the next person. Are there faster ways? Yea, but that'll be more fees. \n\n* It's no where near anonymous. Everything I've dealt with required banking information, driver's license and/or passport to \"verify your ID\". \n\n* Verification is also useless. You have to provide all this information to verify your identify but if you lose one little code you're locked out of your wallet with the excuse of \"Sorry, we can't risk giving you access to the wallet. That $XXXX is lost.\" You want all this information to verify I am who I say I am but you can't use it to let me back into my wallet?\n\n* Being \"in control\" means nothing when wallets have been hacked several times already. Sure, you could keep everything yourself but then you risk actually losing it. Also several sketching wallets out there that have just taken the money and ran with it. \n\nI hate to break it to you, but bitcoin it's the future. It's the internet version of Mary kay or cutco knives. That's it. It's entire existence is companies using it as a way to make money from applying fees to everything and people circlejerking about how it's the future in hopes more people buy it so their investment is worth more. \n\nIf people want to discuss bitcoin as a \"investment\", that's fine but lets stop pretending it's going to an actual currency.",

We have had a 70% retrace already happen. A repeat of 2014 would put us down in the 4s. There is no logical or technical argument for that happening but it doesn't mean that it won't. It's quite possible 2018 will be an extended bottoming process. You need a lot of people to give up. When that happens and the price cannot be pushed any lower you're going to see a lot of confidence with the stronger hands. Right now I think they are hunting to see if 6500 is truly the bottom",

            "Text": "You might consider actually using Bitcoin the way it was designed, not the way wallet services and exchanges are designed.\n&nbsp;\n\nRegarding the 3% fees, I think you are referring to what something like Coinbase charges, which is a service that isn\u2019t actually Bitcoin but instead is a convenience provider. Use Bitcoin itself and don\u2019t pay 3% at every turn.\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for a nine-day hold on a broker account, I am assuming this means a trading exchange, which again is not an indictment of Bitcoin itself, as a trading exchange is a speculative trading tool to day-trade\u2014it\u2019s not actually utilizing the Bitcoin system and abstracts from your actual usage of it (and if your only interface with Bitcoin is via an exchange, you definitely aren\u2019t interacting with the network itself).\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for your point about anonymity, \u201ceverything you\u2019ve dealt with\u201d that asks for your IDs and such: Those services or products are not Bitcoin. Bitcoin as an open source network does not require a name, email address, phone number, mailing address, bank account, citizenship proof, or photo to use. Anyone who sits on the bridge and says you do is capitalizing on your ignorance. In fact, you don\u2019t even need an internet connection to receive bitcoin as payment, amazing no?\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for verification, if you are asking someone else to let you \u201cback into my wallet,\u201d my good friend: This is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin from the first sentence of its design paper specifically intends for you to never have to ask someone to let you access your money. If you are asking someone to let you access your money, doesn\u2019t it occur to you that you therefore don\u2019t own that balance? Bitcoin means you permissionlessly own your money.\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for hacked wallets, I think you are confusing wallet services that you sign into with all of the aforementioned identifications versus actual Bitcoin wallet addresses where you are the sole owner of its private key, or in the case of multisig, its trio of private keys.\n&nbsp;\n\nBefore you put sarcastic quotes around \u201cin control,\u201d suggesting Bitcoin doesn\u2019t let you be in control of your money, perhaps you should try using Bitcoin\u2014itself\u2014and not rely on all of the middleware abstracting you from exactly what you wish it was. Make your wallet, own your keys.",

The reason for the spikes were hype, hence bubble. 2. The true value of the product is pretty much nothing since the average Joe doesn\u2019t need it as a currency, and everyone is using it as speculation. And 3. The general public is not adopting it \u2014 I don\u2019t know anyone who makes purchases using bitcoin, when credit cards, pop money, Venmo, etc., already suffice. \n\nBitcoin is rapidly becoming a laughing stock; its reputation is now simply that of a gambling tool and a means of manipulation by scammers. Its holders are simply zoom\u2013out delusionals, greater-fool hopefuls, and fanatics. ",

Which is safer?  The latter since it is less likely 50k mining farms will join together and manipulate the network (e.g., 51% attack) compared to only 5 mining farms.  In this case, Bitcoin is the one with 50k mining farms.  Note, these numbers are made up for the sake of getting the point across.\n\nTo your second point, mining farms *can not* easily shift their workloads to any cryptocurrency.  A lot of farms of crypto (or algorithm specific) and can only mine certain coins.",

I don't feel like btc is decentralized if groups like mtgox can pump value up and down whenever they want because they have more than anyone on earth can dream to.\n\nPoint is, you can't have a currency worth fiat be independant from said fiat. If you can buy coin with dollars, dollars WILL impact coins. Or if I'm wrong, please explain to me.",

So in 2008 when btc came out how much was it worth. And how much is it worth now. Bitcoin is here to stay when the tulip bubble popped the price didnt go back up or increase a bit.\nWhen the perfect bitcoin is created \"any coin\" that gives us everything we are expecting then that's when you will see mass adoption. Right now we are in the trail and error stages trying to figure out what works.\nI got into bitcoin last year heard about it when it was $700 we I got verified the price was $2000. I bought in and held through the forks. I could of panic but educated myself and thanks to my fellow Bitcoiners they taught me how to Hodl. And when it hit $20000 I took my initial investment. Then I started trying to find ways to use btc in my everyday life.",
