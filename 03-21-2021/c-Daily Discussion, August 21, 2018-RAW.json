I just understood Faketoshi and Ayres Bcash fork idea.\n\n(Sorry for being slow)\n\nThey want to split Bcash and make a fork (Bcash cash?) which they will call - wait for it - Bitcoin SV!\n\n(oh..good name)\n\nSV stands for Satoshi's Vision!\n\nSo, it turns out that Bcash is NOT Satoshi's vision after all (uh?)  \n\nThey are going to have a contentious hard-fork to create the true one.\n\nThe other one (Ver's) would then be called, er, Bcash?

            "Text": "Some Questions for you guys:\n\nConsider this:\n\n> Fork: a situation where two blocks are generated pointing to the same block as their parent, and some portion of miners see one block first and some see the other. This may lead to two blockchains growing at the same time. Generally, it is mathematically near-certain that a fork will resolve itself within four blocks as miners on one chain will eventually get lucky and that chain will grow longer and all miners switch to it; \n\nBut each branch can grow with the same speed in parallel. To me the probability looks huge that branches can get really long. Why can one branch become bigger than another? They all get updated in a 10 minute interval. Or is is due to the way the blocks get propagated from one node to others?\n\n Block Creation Time: \n\n>... The reason this is necessary is that in a decentralized system anyone can produce blocks, so in order to prevent the network from being flooded with blocks, and to provide a way of measuring how much consensus there is behind a particular version of the blockchain, it must in some way be hard to produce a block. \n\nThe last part is hard to understand. Can someone ELI5 what \"a way of measuring how much consensus\" means.\n\nThanks!",

For example, if lots of new hashrate is added to the network, blocktime will be reduced to <10min until the next difficulty adjustment. \n2.\tConsensus simply means everyone agrees on the content (ordered transactions) of a block. If everyone can generate a block whenever they want (without the mining protocol), then the network will be flooded with every version of blocks that includes recent transactions(which can be included in different orders) and none of them will get consensus.

Any ETF that does not require the purchase of Bitcoin will only have a hype effect and less permanent impact as an ETF that does. Still, it will create the spinoff of contributing to a feeling of legitamacy and certainly open the door for a flood of ETFs that will inevitably come down the pipe.\nPersonally, I see the ICE Futures coming in November as the strongest potential for Bitcoin and the coin price. They will be stockpiling Bitcoin and that's the kind of activity that increases price and removes actual BTC from the supply.",
