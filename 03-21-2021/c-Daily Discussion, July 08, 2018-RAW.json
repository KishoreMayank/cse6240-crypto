The pricing strategy was different and the more time, the higher score, the more value the user was generating... When at some point was even able to export that value from the recreational halls by exchanging it for a toy, console or other valuable items.\n\nNow recreational halls are 4, steam-ubisoft-origin-epicgames (centralisation - power).\n\n I'm that type of user who got into computers because of gaming, and then I got into crypto because of computers. And I'm here to discuss about the current situation in the gaming industry... What a scam! We are being scammed everyday, and we have been used to this fraud that we don't even realize it..\ud83d\ude20\n\nNowadays, if you want to experience an ultimate game you have to pay for everything!! \n\nValue transference:\nGame == pay \ud83d\udeae\nSkins == pay\ud83d\udeae\nDLC == pay\ud83d\udeae\nBonus == pay\ud83d\udeae\n\n\nBut then, once you have used skins and want to sell it to export the value from the game there is no option. Games not only offer you the gaming experience, they also track data from your GPU, preferences, inputs...\nThis data has a value, and they are not giving you value for it, they are charging you!\n\nGaming platforms don't give you the right to have the full game, instead the give you a licence to use the game under certain conditions (usually to avoid cheats, but usually.). For more info read the steam terms and conditions.\n\nThis crappy and disgusting situation has made me wake up and fight against this industry \ud83d\ude4c. And the best weapon to fight is Bitcoin. Since several months I have been working in a platform powered with microtransactions via LN \u26a1 where:\n\n\u2713 Users get paid while/for gaming.\n\u2713 Users can extract value from the gaming platform.\n\u2713 Users can choose a charity if they don't want the money they earn while gaming.\n\u2713 Users have the control over the gaming industry and not the opposite.\n\nAfter months of following my dream I'm so close to finally release it! \n\n No gambling, Fuck ICOs & Fuck Scams",

But since 1993, the SEC\u2019s rules have required brokers to wait for three business days between the time an investor\u2019s order is executed, to when the cash and ownership of the security are exchanged.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-settlement-idUSKBN16T1SW\n\nThe SEC just moved from T+3 to T+2. Even with blockchain (assuming it could handle the number of transaction that are needed) we would still be at T+2 until the SEC changed the rules.\n\nWhat's the theoretical maximum transaction limit of Bitcoin? Like 11 transactions a second? How do you think a system like that is going to cope with ALL trades handled in a single stock exchange. I'm willing to bet just one or two high frequency traders ALONE would completely saturate the system.",
