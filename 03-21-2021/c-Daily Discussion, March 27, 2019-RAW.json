There seems to be no such thing. ;) My husband even said that he was sure that this last bubble would be the final one. I wasn't so sure, but the FOMO was there and I figured maybe he was right? There was more interest than ever and talk of an ETF finally being approved. I do think that there might be a point in the adoption curve where it is kind of like the point of no return and we no longer have these dips. But so far it has been the same cycle over and over and over. But if we are following an S-Curve for new technology, it should end well. ",

            "Text": "So some years ago bitcoin was hyped as currency+payment system in one. Now its only hope to become wide spread cash is the LN as the payment system and until sth like this works properly (which might never be the case) its not a great currency because of high fees if a lot of people want to use it.\n\nThen it got much love for beeing able to bank the unbanked. Now its not for the poorest people in the world anymore (even with a properly working LN), according to people behind BTC/LN.\n\nAnd a majority here seems to be okay with that, even though noone can give me a proper answer on why exactly a reasonable block size limit (that might not have reversed adoption because of high fees/long transaction times) was suddenly considered as not secure enough? WTF? Is this for real? (1MB was only supposed to be a temporary anti-spam measure according to satoshi.)\n\nCheck my post history. I asked this multiple times. In daily threads and in comment sections. I just got claims that bigger blocks lead to less decentralization, but what im asking for is facts that back up the claims, that a reasonable block size limit would not provide sufficient decentralization/security. And anyone downvoting me or praising the LN should, without a doubt, be able to provide these! It doesnt make any sense if not!\n\nMaybe i have to add what i mean by reasonable. Im not an expert, so i cant really say a number. What would have likely kept fees low for a good amount of time (maybe until LN is possibly properly working) during the last bull run? 10MB? What facts show that 10MB (or whatever number makes more sense here) does not provide sufficient decentralization/security?\n\nAnother thing to add. Miners chose the 1MB by majority, right? If that happened because they wanted the best for Bitcoin, then there should be clear facts to answer my question with, no? I've heard that this happened because over 2/3 of miners were in china and bigger blocks would have been problematic because of their great firewall. Is that true? There could potentially be other reasons for that consensus too, apart from most miners wanting the best for bitcoin, right?\n\nThis time im posting very early in the daily thread, so everyone can see. Go ahead guys! Thanks!\n\nP.S.: Please dont downvote again if you cant answer! And if noone provides facts again, you should probably question your views instead! How pathetic is it that my posts (just stating facts and asking questions) get downvoted, yet noone provided an appropriate answer (claims backed by facts) so far? Doesnt seem legit to me at all.",

It may have been the most minuscule of risks to increase the blocksize but even that was not worth it because the security of the network is the most important thing. *Any* increase in centralisation is negative to security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA solution to scaling has been created in the form of LN . It has taken a bit of time to develop and will take a little more to become mainstream. But does that matter? We now know that small bitcoin transactions will be essentially free and instant while we can continue to store the main bulk of our Bitcoins on the most secure network on earth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont believe it is true that miners in China chose 1MB because of the Great Firewall as my understanding is that Bitmain, the largest miner, actually backed BitcoinCash but, even if it was true, surely that would be another argument for smaller blocks if it means the Great Firewall is less effective?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitcoin is for everyone: poor, rich and everything in between. It is decentralised and essentially unbreakable. In a few years time, when everyone is making micro payments using LN, this whole block size debate will be a thing of the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

What facts show that 10MB (or whatever number makes more sense here) does not provide sufficient decentralization/security?\n\nassuming full blocks since then (which might happen if there was no fee/wait incentive) the blockchain added 10MB per block.\n\nSO,  well use block 500000 found 19/12/17 - 569006 = 69006 x 10 MB = 690060 MB = 690 GB added to the blockchain since December 2017 = current blockchain of 0.95 TB (3x current size added in last 18 months) \n\nDoes this seem feasible to keep this up for the next 5-10 years?\n\nYou cant prove X+Y = Z without doing X+Y so youre request is bullshit. We can think X+Y = Z and If Z is undesirable, then dont add Y to X.\n\nIf you really want to see how this plays out, use a big block coin and max out its blocks, then try to keep up with the hardware requirements for running a full node. But you cant because the rest of the market chose not to use a big block coin.\n\nHow about you prove big blocks DONT lead to centralisation when processing the same number of TXs? Thats a much easier task, Except no one is using it!\n\nSpam 10MB of TXs PER BLOCK at 1 sat/byte to yourself for a year and see how you go keeping up with the hardware requirements to run a full node. I look forward to you reporting back.\n",

No big bankers beeing able to say bitcoin is not money because its too slow/expensive etc. Would have been quiet nice. Actually it would have been mandatory imo.

            "Text": "Reading up on the history of BTC since 2013, there has always been talk about wanting a \"slow and steady\" or more \"healthy\" rise.  But this is Bitcoin.  There seems to be no such thing. ;)  My husband even said that he was sure that this last bubble would be the final one.  I wasn't so sure, but the FOMO was there and I figured maybe he was right?  There was more interest than ever and talk of an ETF finally being approved.  I do think that there might be a point in the adoption curve where it is kind of like the point of no return and we no longer have these dips.  But so far it has been the same cycle over and over and over.  But if we are following an S-Curve for new technology, it should end well.  ",

I personally think that \"Satoshi\" was an elite far-above-top-secret and multinational group of hackers within the NSA and possibly British, Japanese, Russian and Israeli intelligence who saw what an enormous threat the banksters posed to national and global security in 2008.  I suspect that the keys to that wallet are held by high-level people (well above the POTUS or the queen/emperor or Netanyahu or Putin) who must all agree before the coins are moved.\n\nEither that or Hal Finney was Satoshi, and he died without passing that key on.\n\nBut the fact that Satoshi's identity has never been revealed shows me that he was a 1337 government-level haxzor, not a hobbyist.",

            "Text": "This is right. Clearly, when the bitcoin block chain was originally implemented, it was necessary to pick some size, which happened to be 1MB. Beyond that you either (a) go with the BCash argument that increased block size improves performance without sacrificing too much security or (b) go with the BTC argument which is the reverse, or maybe (c) that you could decrease the blocksize.\n\nI imagine that the original 1MB was something of a finger-in-the-wind sort of choice. It seems to have been fine with BTC so far as security is concerned, while scaling issues are better handled by something like lightening. So, yes, the onus would be to justify increasing it and focusing on one particular number is pointless.",
