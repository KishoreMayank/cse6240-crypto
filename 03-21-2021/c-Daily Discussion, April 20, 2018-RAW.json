As if I didn\u2019t have enough reason to hate Coinbase/GDAX, they pull this crap raising their fees up to 3x the normal 0.25% fee to buy and sell Bitcoin at market prices on their exchange. Not to mention, lately GDAX has indicated \u201cpartially degraded service.\u201d Is this a conspiracy by Coinbase, a sudden move to take advantage of this dire moment? I swear once I can get into Robinhood, I will never trade with Coinbase. I despise and hate everything about them. They are the new Mt. Gox.",

When its quite high, set a stop loss like 500 below current price (or use the average true range) and keep moving it up as the price increases. You can get close to the top this way.\n\nBut theres no guarenteed way to sell the top and buy the bottom. Just either hodl for years or add stop losses when you have good profits. Don't be too greedy or else you'll probably ride it all the way down again",

The 90-day moving average is still higher, at 9103. Even if it just keeps moving sideways a little while longer then it will get out of the downward trend, but it still needs to break out of the last high of 8905 to be considered anything like a true bull market, even a short-term one. A key to watch for here is whether volumes pick up -- the latest rise has been on relatively light volumes.",

I sold  my coins  just before the last \"dip\" to 6k \n\nWas planning in re buying sometime in the future but had to stay away from the charts for a couple of days for health and other reasons .. then boom 12th spike happened. Now I got my paycheck and re bought some. Hoping it will reach the price I need to cover my losses at-least. But with my luck I think it will dump again :| ",

You average the price over the last ten days today, and plot it on a chart.  Tomorrow is a new day, so you average over the previous 10 days (dropping the one 11 days ago, and take a new simple average again.)\n\nAs you can imagine, this smooths out all the wiggles very nicely.\n\nBut precisely which timescale you choose, and how may periods of that chosen timescale you average over - well - that is for the (alleged) experts.  :)\n\nPersonally, being a VERY long term hodler, I like the log graph for BTC over all time (or since about 2011.)",
