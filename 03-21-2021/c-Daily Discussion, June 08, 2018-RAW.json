Bitcoin's Low Volatility May Force Big Move**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/which-way-now-low-bitcoin-price-volatility-may-force-breakout/\n\nBitcoin has been squeezed into an increasingly narrow range for more than two weeks and is now experiencing volatility not seen for eight months.\n\nAs a result, it's looking likely that bitcoin could soon make a strong move, but the direction it will take when that happens is less than clear. Since May 24, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $7,000\u2013$7,800 range, which is already very tight, but the price has barely moved in the last 36 hours, likely indicating an indecisive market.\n\nDaily volatility, as indicated by the spread between the daily price high and daily price low, fell to $107.63 on Thursday \u2013 the lowest level since Oct. 2, 2017 and down 86 percent from the 2018 average of $793, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nAs of writing, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are at $7,580, marking around a $100 drop over 24 hours.\n\nView\n\nA move above $7,819 (50-week moving average) would signal a bullish breakout and would set the tone for a rally to pennant resistance located at $8,880.\n\nOn the downside, a break below $7,090 (pennant support) would imply a bearish breakdown. In this case, BTC could potentially drop below $6,000 (Feb low).",

This likely means a lot of the new money (6 months or less) is stuck in this wave of value (6k to 19k) and waiting for the next wave of new money to bring it past 19k. Some of these people will sell and some will hodl. How far past the price goes is anyone's guess but I bet it will come back down again and the clock will reset at a higher price than 20k. By resetting the clock I mean that we will have newer hodlers but at a much higher value. This has been the case since the beginning of Bitcoin and the past isn't always indicative of the future and blah blah you know what else.",

When that project gets the unbelievable TALENT that is working on bitcoin, than you can complain about equal time for all others. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how a project such as bitcoin is not good enough for the type of person you describing? \n\nThe infrastructure and dedication and support from these people who could work on any project or for any company they want at any salary they want, is not enough sign to people of what the future is going to be because these devs are the ones who will create it. Microsoft wants this talent so bad it bought GitHub for millions hoping to lure even a few to work for them. \n\n",
