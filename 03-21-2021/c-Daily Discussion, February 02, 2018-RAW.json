Now the basket is presumed to be equal to the purchase price of the last banana transaction times the number of bananas in my market. So all of these bananas are worth ($1x10 bananas) $10 in total. I then convince another one of you to buy a banana for $19,000. Well based on the last price the market for the basket just went up to $190,000. The problem is there is no depth to this market so if the first guy goes to sell his banana for $19,000 but can\u2019t find anyone and the best he can do is sell it for $1, then the market will collapse back down to $10.",

I don't disagree with you, all of the tech coming to our beloved coin this year is going to be nothing short of amazing. \"\n\nI responded:\n\n> I do agree with people who see the long-term volatility of Bitcoin dropping as the price goes up. I think the price of Bitcoin stays extremely volatile for as long as it has a sub 1 Million USD price tag, or thereabout. If we can move people to talking about a satoshi as a practical measure of exchange then we have \"normal stability\" in the price range that depicts a common subdivision of value. A 10 percent change in value will not bother regular users, who in many markets are more familiar with much larger fluctuations in the value of their currency.\n>\n>My assumption is that it will be so costly to change the market cap of bitcoin by 10% at that time that price manipulation will be extremely difficult, if not impossible. If the price is able to go another order of magnitude above 1m USD/BTC we'll be looking at price manipulation on a scale that's only accessible to nations. I think that's what Satoshi was talking about when he said 21 million BTC as an absolute cap was an \"educated guess.\"",

You know how people love to jump into the stock market when ever it crashes to get a good price point of entry? Same with this, it's common sense.

Anyone who sells it now after buying it at 12k, 15k, whatever, is insane...unless they just desperately need the cash right now I guess. But man, what a crazy loss they are taking needlessly.",

In mid November I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, and pledged myself to no-fap for the first time ever (when I was dating I would usually masturbate/have sex multiple times each day) so this was a big deal for me. I did it mainly because I wanted to work on my self discipline, and it went pretty well until I found a girl around the end of the first week in January. We had sex, and ever since then i've just been cumming buckets each day. Either with her or masturbating, I feel so guilty because I know that with every orgasm I'm causing the price to crash more and more but at this point I just can't stop it. \n\nI know for a fact that this is the case because when I had a wet dream during no fap for the first time in December, the price crashed hard the next day; while when I refrained from orgasming the price only rose in value. I will try my best to not masturbate anymore, and when I have sex I will try not to climax. If the price continues to fall, I've failed you all. Please, lend me your strength one last time ",

            "Text": "I am not that surprised or concerned about this sell off. The price is 10x what it was this time last year. What has happened since is that a lot of unsophisticated amateurs have piled in since then. They are both greedy and fearful and when you have that state of affairs, you can expect big highs (greed) and big lows (fear). The problem for too many is that they are conflating the price story, with the usability and potential of this technology. If you do this, you will never understand what is happening.\n\n99% of the posts here are about the price. If you want to get involved with that , knock yourself out, for me, that is cart before the horse territory. If you understand the technology and believe in it, then the faith in the price will follow it. I have no truck with those that do not believe in the technology, there are huge challenges and other competing coins, for sure bitcoin has plenty of scope for failure. What I do take issue with is people using the state of the price and extrapolating out that this therefore means the technology is flawed, even if that were true, it does not follow, just because the price is going up or going down.\n\nThe price is going to be in the hands of the greedy and the fearful for some time, there is little we can do about that. If the technology however continues to improve - as I believe it will - then it will be the value proposition that determines the price and frankly that's all that ever should. Everything else is a sideshow, get sidetracked if you wish, but my point to 99% of the people here, if you are in for a quick buck, you are going to have a v. bumpy ride, if you want to play smart, read up on the technology and pick a side, whatever side you pick though, let it be based on due diligence, not on the weather vane posters  who are everywhere",

I\u2019m laughing at the people who started to buy in less than 3 months ago and are planning on selling at a loss if it continues to go down. If you invested less than $10,000 and are willing to sell for a loss very soon, you are a fool. Never put in what you can\u2019t afford to lose. Good news is that there is permanent support at $800, bc that is roughly the cost of production for 1 coin. ",

To me looking at the graphs it looks very strange , especially since nearly any average joe can set up a coin and suddenly it has a value ? Some coins even basing its value off other ones ? Tether and bitcoin cash ? ",

Then as people will start panic sell they'll buy everything back up. Since the price is dropped from 10k to 7.5k, a whale earned the difference of 2.5k without losing bitcoin. It is important not to crash the market when you do the fleecing of the flock because that is same as gutting the golden goose.",

            "Text": "I got a technical question about deleted BTC and Blockchain. Didn't find any answer in any FAQ/documentation.\n\nWhen BTC is \"lost\" (HDD destroyed for example) there is no way to recover your loss if there is no physical copy of that data, fine.\n\nHowever, I wonder how the Blockchain reacts to that event.\n\n1. Are the BTC detected as destroyed?\n\n2. Are the BTC still in the chain in a ghost state (always held, never sold)?\n\n3. Is there a \"cleanup\" process of the Blockchain to remove ghosts?\n\nBtw, I do not ask for what appens to the wallet, but for the chain itself. Having ghost BTC would be an everyday growing flaw leading to the falsification of the \"real\" value of BTC, and i find strange that i've never heard of that before (basically that's why I post here).\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: http://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/",

They went out there and sold the technological inovation for unrealistic promise of becoming rich. I feel crypto became 2 big because of that.

As long as the people who are spending capital, time, and electricity to secure the network, bitcoin will live on. \n\nMiners will actually short a small percent of their mining rewards, so that if it goes down in price (they make money), if it goes up in price, the larger percent of their holdings increases in value. If you see a long term decline in bitcoin hashing power, that is the one true sign things are bad, since the blockchain will be susceptible to attack.\n\nAs long as there are more computers securing bitcoin versus the ones who don't play by the rules, bitcoin will survive. It's really that simple. You can ignore the FUD, the news, the bans, the dips... none of that matters to the rules of bitcoin. If the people who have real skin in the game aren't sweating it, then neither should you.",

They didn't accumulate all that capital by being stupid or weak.  They want to own this market, too, and they probably will eventually.  They're going to get the majority of coins.  Not just from the weak hands but the strong ones, the smart ones, etc.  They're going to hang Joe Blow upside down and beat on the bottom of his boots until all the coins have emptied from his pockets.  Their effects will be terrifying and their arguments extremely convincing.  \n\nThat being said, I don't think they're what is driving the prices down.  We, John Q. Public, are.  Speculators are.  I mean, the big boys certainly help but more likely they just get the ball rolling in one direction or the other and we do the rest.",

That\u2019s accurate in the binary (it\u2019ll either rain, or it wont), but that\u2019s not really what the odds of rain are each day if you look out the window. Looking out the window in bitcoin is 4-5 years of continual support and improvement. Many dips and \u201ccrashes\u201d later it\u2019s still worth more today than most would\u2019ve thought possible a year ago. So the odds aren\u2019t 50/50.

Expect to pay a heavy premium for them and also be ready to be scammed out of your cash or robbed.\n\nOption 4: Register on an exchange (may not be possible in your country/some exchanges are closed to new members) which can take weeks; Once you're registered - send them your cash and hope it turns up on the exchange; If you actually get cash into the exchange you can then place buy orders and hope they actually get filled correctly. If you then want to use those BTC you'll have to pay a fee to transfer them back to that wallet from Step 1. Then sit on them because there's not really much else you can do with them.\n\nWelcome to Bitcoin :)",

I buy it via a website and put it in my electrum wallet. Now when the whole thing collapses and that \u20ac1000 is worth nothing. Is it possible that the site or the wallet can say \"ok now you owe us some money\" and I have to pay more than I've invested? I think this is not possible afcourse if you don't use sites with leverage. But it still makes me nervous. I was in the understanding that I bought crypto and than I own it. If it crashes, well it's gone but with no further problems than losing the exact amount of money that I put in not a penny more. (Besides the miner fees and the fee the website asks 2,5% when selling or buying). ",

Absolutely, but it's not like any crypto/blockchain/network is actually being used for it's purpose, it's being used as a speculation vehicle.\n\nOnce things die down and people start using cryptos for it's proper intended use, yes maybe it will go back to 20k.\n\nImo opinion the \"limited supply\" is a flawed argument, which shouldn't mean that Bitcoins price will endlessly go up. To me, a fair price of Bitcoin is the cost of mining + a risk premium (30-50%). If this is the case, It will be some time before Bitcoin goes up to 19k, if ever.",

            "Text": "Agreed. The problem here though is the huge losses that many have experienced, especially the average joes that jumped on board in the last month or two as crypto hit the mainstream society.\n\nThose are the people (particularly the wealthier, more privileged, more resource-rich) that will complain the loudest and push for severe regulation, legal issues, lawsuits, etc... you name it.\n\nThis isn't just crypto nerds losing money and realizing the technology has huge potential, like after Mt. Gox. This is now the rich senator's son that learned about bitcoin from a drunk friend at Harvard, and now that he lost 60% of the six-figure loan his dad gave him, the whole crypto community will have to pay in the form of dealing with more regulations, backlash, legal challenges, and so on. Same goes for the many, many other average, everyday working folks that thought crypto would pay off their mortgage by March.\n\nBasically, this time around is more concerning because CNBC, the SEC, the South Korean gov't, soccer moms, Harvard elites, etc... are losing money--not just crypto junkies that realize the technology has growing pains.",

The blockchain is simply a record of transactions, \"Alice gave X to Bob\" (it doesn't explicitly record how much Bob has, that's worked out from the transactions he received). Once a transaction gets into the blockchain it can't ever be changed. Doing so will change the hash of the block where it's in and that of every subsequent block. This is what makes the system tamper-proof.",

Bitpay does not have access to it, and if you delete the app, the bitcoin is gone forever (if you didn't back it up).\n\nThat's the beauty in it. Digital Currency can be hit or miss, but this is \"Digital cash\" because YOU have control. If you export your wallet keys and import into another app or program, it still works.\n\nAnd the wallet company has no access or control, it's stored on your phone, and the app holder doesn't need to even have a server.\n\nCoinbase, for example, is much like taking cold, hard cash, and putting it in a bank Safety Deposit Box, trusting them with it not to lose it or have it stolen. But at the end of the day, it's Cash in digital form, in that you don't have to give up control.\n\nI guess if you \"Deposit\" it, they could pay interest, but it's not stable enough yet. ",

That was about 80% of our established infrastructure at the time, by trade volume. \n\n2013 - 2014 is not similar to where we are today. Bitcoin is not a four-year fractal on repeat. The market forces that caused the boom and bust cycle then are orders of magnitude greater than what we're seeing today.\n\nIf you're going to make comparisons you need to go into a deep analysis that compares the state of Mt. Gox to the state of Alts.\n\n\"Everyone\" is not aware of Bitcoin's existence. \"They're\" certainly not aware of how it works and \"they\" don't own any of it. \"They\" don't have a practical use for it in their lives and \"they\" don't know how to get it. \"They\" don't care to find out.\n\n\"Everyone\" is aware of gold, and even then, most people don't care to go out of their way to acquire it. If they had the means, then maybe. If everyone were aware of Bitcoin then it would be speculated on similarly to gold because global rates of adoption would be amazingly high. It's not, and it won't be for a while. We can only bust at the seams for so long until we must cool off.\n\nWe, Bitcoin, are licking our wounds and getting a plan together so the next round of this is handled better. Infrastructure is improving, and will continue to improve. The hash rate will continue to go up, and more people will find a practical use for bitcoin.\n\nA sudden drop in speculative fervor is not the same thing as having a clear majority of your infrastructure curl up and die overnight; which was caused by one of the largest international thefts in history (and gross incompetence) ... and then the government of 1/3 of the world\u2019s population, where most of the trading and mining is happening, fucks with you endlessly. \n\nI haven't even mention \"Willy Bot\" yet.\n\n\"Slow\" and steady. We're doing fine.\n\n",

However, given the past 9 years of data, this is a recurring event. Just because the last peak of almost 20k got more publicity, there's no reason to think the same thing won't happen again. ESPECIALLY since now it's easier to buy than ever before and it's slowly becoming an investment choice of the younger generation (who are becoming more a part of the mainstream investors every day as they get older). \nThat being said, I personally hate the fact that Bitcoin is the entry point to altcoins such as VeChain and Walton which have a very promising future.  These are where new investment dollars should be able to go directly, not via Bitcoin. I think this is half the problem with all this. But onward into the future I'm confident we'll see opportunity to buy directly as a result of the demand to do so.",

That's not how chaotic systems work. \n\nYes, good and bad news have an impact but not in a straightforward way. You cannot pin this last fall to a single story or a bunch of them, even. Markets are complex and move based on thousands of reasons. Some are clearly visible, some are not.\n\nWe are in the middle of downtrend and it's possible that it will continue for a while. That doesn't mean every single thing that happens is responsible for it or that the market is reacting to it. Same goes for when (or if) this ship turns around. People will try to attach positive stories to it to piece together a narrative, while ignoring the bad ones.  \n\nThe market is reacting to itself, nothing more, nothing less. It's bear time. Compounded by the fact that it's difficult to know what is the \"fair value\" of BTC ($1000, $100, $1,000,000, $1?).

You see him pulling the Bitcoin sticker of the wall with sad music. In the end one guy says he is leaving New York because \"Bitcoin is dead here\". Its a bit different but to new people watching it, it comes across ass a bunch of greedy idiots who first were rich thanks to supporting criminals in buying drugs and in the end they go to jail. So basicly that could be creating a loss in sells to I geuss.",

That doesn't help you push the odds very far from 50/50 for even very large swings either way.  \n\nWith that information, how should you bet (buy)?

            "Text": "At first glance, sharks and dolphins may seem to be similar in size and shape, though sharks obviously appear to be stronger for obvious reasons already mentioned.  However, when taking a closer look there are many differences in the two that can be noted and give the dolphin quite an advantage.  Sharks are an ancient fish with skeletons of cartilage, where dolphins are descended from mammals that have returned to the sea and sport skeletons with hard, calcified bones.  The skeletons of sharks have joints that are not as flexible as the dolphins.\n\nIt is for this reason that dolphins sometimes have the upper hand and are much swifter than sharks.  They have also been known to maneuver very quickly and are very agile in the water.  The tail of a shark is also different from a dolphin.  A shark\u2019s tail has a fins located on a vertical plane that move from side to side which limits its ability to quickly dive downward and /or rise upward.  A dolphin\u2019s tail however has horizontally mounted flukes that move up and down and enable a dolphin to change direction with ease, allowing it to move upward or downward with no problem.\n\nSince dolphins normally travel together in groups, if one of the group is threatened by a shark, the other dolphins will join in without hesitation to do its best to defend the dolphin that is in danger.  The dolphin\u2019s main weapon against a shark attack is its snout, which is made up of very strong and thick bone and has a hard rounded end.  The dolphins circle the shark rapidly from different directions thus confusing the shark and rendering it unable to chase any of the other dolphins.\n\nWhen a dolphin is positioned below a shark at a distance of several yards, the dolphin will often make a sudden rush at the shark\u2019s soft underbelly and ram it with its snout.  The effect this has on the shark can be quite effective.  It resembles a powerful punch and can seriously injure a shark with just one blow.  When dolphins use this as their weapon against sharks, it often renders the shark stunned or knocks them unconscious immediately.  Sometimes a dolphin will repeatedly ram a shark that has been aggressive in order to protect itself or its group, and in some cases have even been known to kill large and dangerous sharks.  In most cases, even if the shark does not die as a result of the dolphin driving its snout into its underbelly, the force that it has on the shark will often leave some kind of internal damage.",

Sorry for over-simplifying it. \n\nBut basically, the answer is that control over your Bitcoin is stored on your wallet, and if you're using Zap wallet, you're not trusting Zap with your money, therefore they have no control over it. \n\nAlthough technically, a wallet that's running a full node (even if it's purging old blocks) is storing Bitcoin on it.\n\n",

Of course not! \n\nWhat kind of actual physical wallet do you use to store debit cards and cash? That brand? Do they store your money for you? Can they loan it out? Duh, of course not!\n\nSame thing. This is how Bitcoin works. It's not saved by the company. They can't even see that you have Bitcoin. The \"wallet\" is just an app that types in all the complicated code for you, so that you don't have to type in tons of codes and encryption keys and stuff just to send or receive it. The wallet just makes it easy for you to do it and does it in the background. \n\nDoes Bitpay have access to your bitcoins stored on your Bitpay wallet on your phone? No! Not at all!\nYou are using a wallet coded by them, but THEY DO NOT have your bitcoins. There is no login for the wallet. \n\nIf you want someone to pay you interest, just may as well do it with USD for now. \n\n\nIf you have bitcoins on your laptop and your laptop is destroyed, without your backup or a copy of your private key that is used to interact with the network, youll never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see those bitcoins again, period, and nobody else will, period. Not Bitpay, not zap, nobody. If you contact Bitpay wallet company, they will tell you \"Sorry, we don't even know how many people use our wallet, because we don't even have servers to create accounts, anyone can download it and use it and we have no connection and can't see how much money is in it\"\n\nIf Bitpay company shut down forever and died, Bitpay wallet would work and your bitcoins would be yours. You never give up control of Bitcoin.\n\n\nBitcoin is called \"digital cash\" because it's the FIRST currency EVER to both behave and be cash, while ALSO being digital with no middleman. PayPal holds your money. Chase holds your money. Venmo holds your money. \n\nBitcoin does not. It's cash. The analogy would be physically buying a wallet by Calvin Klein and putting $100 in it. You didn't give $100 for Calvin Klein to control, because you physically hold on to it. \n\nYou just chose a Calvin Klein wallet to hold your dollars in. \n\nCoinomi wallet doesn't have any control over it, you just chose that brand of wallet to store your dollars in because it's stylish and looks cool and easy to use and you like all the pouches.

Its the first time in history that people have an option outside of the control of Federal Reserve, banking, governments, etc.  Bitcoin can and is being improved upon, just like the iPod.  It also has the first mover advantage and biggest network affect.  Most importantly because it is Money,  TRUST is the biggest issue.  It has stood the test of time and not failed.  Forks provide alternative use cases, but Trust and security that has been proven over time are crucial. IMO",

            "Text": "> My assumption is that it will be so costly to change the market cap of bitcoin by 10% at that time that price manipulation will be extremely difficult, if not impossible. If the price is able to go another order of magnitude above 1m USD/BTC we'll be looking at price manipulation on a scale that's only accessible to nations. I think that's what Satoshi was talking about when he said 21 million BTC as an absolute cap was an \"educated guess.\"\n\nI suspect that after this bubble it will be extremely difficult to move the price down sufficiently fast to trigger huge selloffs like we see in the current market. Substantially less BTC will be moving into the market from miners, too.",

            "Text": "I guess we have different views of the government's proper role. I personally believe the government should be limited strictly to stepping in when someone else's actions infringe on your basic rights to life, liberty and property. And enforcing contracts. And at the federal level in the United States, it should be limited to the few, specific duties assigned to it by the Constitution.\n\nSimply saying \"it exists to protect you from being crushed by the rich and powerful\" is too vague and opens the door to government growing in power and abusing that power for its own benefit.\n\nIf you expect government to step in and try to \"level the playing field\" (which is also vague), you will be sorely disappointed every time. The government consists of people just like you and I who can just as easily become corrupt just like anyone else. Giving the government that kind of power only opens the door to abuse.",

This bounce up from $7.5k to $9k is nothing compared to that, be careful guys, ive lost a lot of funds and Ive timed the market very well, but it always comes back. Its above $9,000 now but it was at this level yesterday also. There might be some stabilization here and it might jump above $10-11K but this might not be over. These big rises are normal in a bubble like this. Sharp rises followed by slow bleedouts. If its $13k this time next week, you can breath easy. Otherwise if its struggling to hold $9-10k its only gonna come back down. This is not an asset Id want to be in just yet. ",

In Rome they were diluting their gold coins with copper to fund conquests, eventually people realized that it became fully copper and worthless, then the free market went back to gold. In my opinion crypto is great for the short term because there is a 91% correlation with crypto price In creases and hype, but for the long term I believe gold will come backwhen people realize crypto and the USD is not valuable ",

            "Text": "I agree with people who see the long-term volatility of Bitcoin will drop as the price goes up. It seems reasonable that concentrations of BTC will diffuse over time. I can think of a few ways to map that over time. Of course, it could also be that the number of addresses increases because the same people keep creating more addresses. I don't think that's the story, though.\n\nI'm speculating that the the price of Bitcoin stays extremely volatile for as long as it has a sub 1 Million USD price tag, or thereabout. Price stability probably doesn't have a specific price so much as it has required conditions, though.\n\n* Market Capitalization is too high for any co-ordinated group to attack\n* Number of nodes/wallets continues to expand\n* The network of users continues to grow\n* Ability to transact is not overly burdened by fees\n\nThere are probably a bunch more. That's just off the top of my head.\n\n1m USD/BTC is just a guess. Probably not a great one, but probably not terribly wrong, either.",

Also i am succesfull so from my point i am just telling other people how i manage my investments.  What good are you bringing i stead?

If my phone dies and I have to reconnect, it could cost $20 and take an hour. Not feasible. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you didn\u2019t know that opening and closing a channel costs time and money, or you chose to ignore it, but it is a big deal.
