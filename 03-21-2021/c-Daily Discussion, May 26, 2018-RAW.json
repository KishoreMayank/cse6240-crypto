But, I predicted this weekend of stagnancy just like I knew last week would fall miserably. So, what\u2019s happening next week? More stagnancy.. Bitcoin will not fall below $6700 until June; however it will hit $7K by month\u2019s end before recovering a few hundred dollars. We have some very unexciting times ahead. That\u2019s just the cold hard truth. Whales right now want people to be comfortable with stagnancy as opposed to sharp falls. They will continue to manipulate volume to lure inexperienced traders and daytraders which represents the bulk of their new money during stagnant days. As soon as people see stability through stagnancy, they will look away come June 5-6 where another big drop take place far below $6700 to $6300 and beyond. Until then, Bitcoin will remain between $6800-$7700.",

And my guess is it\u2019s certainly some  hallucinogens (lsd, mushrooms, etc) but also mixed a little with stimulants like cocaine, amphetamine, etc. I would take anything he says with a grain of salt. I mean this is a 72 yr old murderer, pedophile, drugs abuser... he is like the ultimate piece of shit who got lucky working for Lockheed at the right time giving him the needed inspiration to create McAfee antivirus software. His life today is like his net worth: it\u2019s tanked completely...how would you feel if you lost 96% of your peak net worth? $4 million is still a lot of money but if I lost 96% of my worth, I guarantee you I would be rambling on Twitter, sedated and stimulated with drugs...providing spontaneous misconceived lectures on philosophy, economy and history...hoping to maintain some sense of relevance in my life that has no purpose...John McAfee.\n",

Isn't releasing this news manipulation in and of itself?? If there was a real reason for a competent government to examine wrong doing and manipulation, with actual intent to penalize, fix, and regulate it, they would have done so long ago whilst keeping it as hush as possible. The fact is that the US government is as big of crooks as those manipulating the crypto market and a lot less competent too. They are just too dumb to realize that crypto markets will never be completely regulated if at all. These dips are fully the cause of large money interests (governments included) manipulating price in order to shake out scared bitcoin owners so that they can accumulate; simple as that.",
