            "Text": "If you invest in Bitcoin like the stock of a mature company (i.e. a significant quantity and buying/selling with the trend) you will get hurt badly.\n\nI see Bitcoin as an investment in a startup. If you invested in Facebook, Microsoft or Amazon in the early days you couldn't even know the value as it was not listed, but probably it would look somewhat like that (very volatile and difficult to price).\n\nI tend to see more Bitcoin as a binary event: it either progresses in adoption and becomes more mainstream or it fails completely.\n\nI risked an investment I am willing to lose and I buy periodically quantities I could afford to lose, just like if I was investing in a startup.\n\nAnd so I don't care if the price goes to 5k or 10k or 20k in the short term, because I am not going to sell in either case. If Bitcoin gets to mainstream adoption, then I will probably sell part of it, when is 6 figures. If it goes to zero so be it.\n\nIf you are glued to the daily price of Bitcoin, in my opinion, you are taking the wrong approach. You don't invest in a startup to pull up the day, week, or month after, you leave the investment there for years and follow the development of its technology and if it is successful you exit, if not you probably lose your investment.\n\nBut if you are daily trading it it could be the case that it goes to six figures and you have only been losing along the way.",

The \"I bought at 50 dollar a coin\" guy, the \"Oh yea, I mined back in '15 in my basement\" guy, the \"stop spreading FUD, I'm down 50% but I'm ok with it\" guy, and my personal favorite \"Oh yea that's what they said at 1K\" guy. Most of these guys are full of shit, either they're lying or they're delusional. You guys are literally all excuses when it comes to losses. For the select few who are OGs, respect but you still fucked up.\n\nI'm not ok with BTC dropping. Sure, I bought at 2K but I'm not fucking ok with it dipping 50% and I'm deadass tired of salty people playing it off, just face it, you lost money you could've earned when it was ATH, stop acting immature and realized you fked up to some degree. Secondly, I'm convinced the only thing that significantly changes BTC price is public speculation and image. Literally no one cares about the shit you guys find on the internet about some altcoin ICO changing BTC prices or some \"whales\" manipulating prices and other ridiculous bullshit. I really hope everyone on this subreddit is an adult and can grow a pair and realize you fked up, decide if you're cashing out or not. If not, STFU and hold,  but stop looking for the BS conspiracy theory that's changing BTC prices, literally none of that shit matters. I can't believe the amount of people who lost their judgement due to saltiness, where are my real people at? If you're emotionally attached to bitcoin I don't judge but you should seriously consider stopping investing this ain't for you. \n\n&#x200B;",

The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.",

I did it to buy an advantage (a weapon) in an MMO  called ArcheAge.  I wanted to buy an item against the \"tos\" but it was $1000 and paypal wouldn't facilitate it so we used bitcoin.  It was fine as an anonymous way to beat the system.\n\nLast Thanksgiving all we could talk about was Bitcoin and alt coins.  It was pure fomo.  Thanks to gemini being so backed up for new accounts i wasn't able to transfer $100,000 over to buy BTC and some altcoins.\n\nBut then i began doing research.  The altcoins were all basically GoFundMe accounts with no responsibility or accountability.  This was the first thing that caught my attention.  My justification for Bitcoin was that you HAD to use Bitcoin to purchase altcoins.  BUT if the altcoins were crap then why need Bitcoin besides for the original reason I used it....as alternative nefarious fiat?  And if Bitcoin was currency then the last thing I wanted was for it to gain AND lose value.  I don't pay for my coffee with Apple shares.  Why would I?\n\nAgain, none of you were the \"strong hands\" that rode BTC to 20k from $10.  If you did that and didn't sell when you were worth millions then yikes.  I know I will never buy BTC.  And i know my relatives and friends are long done with it.  It is not some secret anymore.  I would let these folks who have been buying since 13k continue to kindly buy your BTC as you keep what you can while you can.",

It\u2019s had 7 days of shitcoin-like crashing, dropping in the double digits percentage-wise. Many of you never imagined Bitcoin could fall below $6K and there surely was great support at the level...by whom? You couldn\u2019t say...there was just some imaginary support the whales mislead you in believing. I said many times that Bitcoin would fall below $5K by the end of the year into the beginning of 2019. Many labeled me as a paranoid FUD pot-stirrer. No I just read historical trends and understand support at nearly 10x the start of the last bull run (when BTC was $600) can\u2019t be held forever. Today, Bitcoin is performing exactly like every shitcoin and that\u2019s why so many of you are in shock. I don\u2019t care much for altcoins but unlike many of you, I don\u2019t worship Bitcoin especially BCashBeTrash, he\u2019s the biggest culprit. And any of you who would not sell at $6K but are now selling at $4.8K are delusional beyond repair. Sure, the pain hurts but at least hold until BTC returns to $6K which it will most certainly will in the next 3 months...or institute a stop-buy plan where you can rebuy BTC at a safe price.  Buying high and selling low is exactly how you go broke. You might have lost value in your BTC but you don\u2019t lose money until you sell your coins...",

The SEC will not allow retirement accounts be subjected to this manipulation which they can\u2019t arrest. ",

To me that means cease to exist. But maybe you guys have another definition.\n\nAlso, can you explain long term investing to me? As I understand that, it's longer than 11 months.\n\nBitcoin still has the potential to be better than gold, better than dollars. If it continues to have that potential the sky is the limit on value long term. It's still being thought of like a stock. But it's the newest and best form of money humanity has created since gold, paper, and digital accounting. Wake up. If bitcoin is ever equal to the dollars in circulation, each bitcoin will be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.",

            "Text": "\"1) Lack of Momentum\nThe fall of October 14th was dramatic: the price approached $6,000 with determination and totally collapsed once it crossed the round number. Bitcoin reached $5,450 quite quickly and could never recapture the round number of $6,000. Moreover, it broke below $5,770, the previous 2018 trough and fell to the lowest levels since October 2017.\n\nThe drop below $5,000 is not that dramatic. The price went down quite slowly throughout the day. While the move below $5,000 looked swift, the price only reached $4,950 before bouncing back and seeming comfortable again above $5,000.\n\n2) Deeply oversold conditions\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is well below 30 for several days, followed that November 14th collapse. While financial assets do not always bounce back after the RSI drops below 30, they cannot stay there for too long. Five days is a lot to have an RSI of around 16.\n\nSo, when everybody is short, who is left to sell? A buyback by some bulls is natural at such extreme conditions.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis November 19 2018\n\n3) Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin\nOne of the primary drivers for the fall was the mess around Bitcoin Cash. BCH, which emerged out of a hard fork out of Bitcoin back in August 2017, has its own hard fork. The competing forks are busy with hash wars, with some exchanges warning of issues with one of these spin-offs. The story dampened the whole crypto-sphere.\n\nHowever, BTC is not BCH nor any of its forms. The stories are not related. \n\nAnother reason for the impatient sell-off was the lack of a Bitcoin ETF. However, the SEC has not shut the door on approving such an instrument, a move that would make mainstream investment easier.\"\n\nFull article:\nhttps://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-price-top-prediction-3-reasons-why-the-drop-under-5-000-was-a-fake-one-s-buying-opportunity-201811191708\n\nDo you agree?",

It doesn't seem plausible in my mind, nor does it seem like it's whats best for the crypto industry (competition encourages innovation & monopolies = bad). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what's the long-term plan? How do we make sure that 5 years down the line when some schmuck starts shilling \"Bitcoyne\" it doesn't hurt bitcoin?",

What this would imply is that all other currencies determine their value via comparison to Bitcoin rather than the USD.\n\nSeems trivial, but here\u2019s the consequence:\n\nWe would then not say things like \u201cBitcoin dip again...\u201d or \u201cBitcoin is skyrocketing!\u201d \n\nRather, we\u2019d say things like:\n\n\u201cThe USD has dropped again today and is worth next to nothing (100,000 US Dollars for ONE Bitcoin?!?!)\u201d \n\nor \n\n\u201cThe USD rises again! From 5000 USD for 1 BTC to 4000 USD for 1 BTC!\u201d\n\nI just find how the mere change in rhetoric (depending on which is the prevailing currency) can change the average person\u2019s perspective on things fascinating.

So, now the interest level went from 8 to 12 in 2 weeks. Somewhere between 4000 and 6000 is the bottom, cause price follows interest. It looks like the interest level in btc is climbing, but it might be too soon to tell if these are new investors or current investors with a higher level of interest. So if it's climbing, price may go up to correspond with level of interest. ",

Whatever economic freedom people including myself were dreaming of is pretty much in the hands of the rich and petty lol. I hate to see so many people losing their money due to old people who have no idea how to settle their disputes behind closed doors.  Every coin is getting wrecked.  It is hard to keep faith in something that is easily toyed with. ETF will not get approved and Craig has shown he is pretty much untouchable. Any mining now is for sure doing it at a loss.   \n\n\nAll of this drama just scares people away from the mass adaption we wanted. A lot of merchants are going to see this high school drama and refuse to get near. Banks are loving this I am sure. I have not seen the so-called suicide threads but I do not blame people for becoming suicidal and it is a dick move to have any empathy for them. Time to step away from the market for a while and go back to other plans. Crypto, in general, will not recover from this till the rich kids are done with all the fighting.  I understand telling people not to sell but folks have to make ends meet and if this is draining you get out for a while. If you buy or hold at this point I personally do not think it even matters, in the long run, you will lose out. ",

(The collective \"you\", mind). \n\nIt doesn't predict markets with absolute certainty, and it is not supposed to. It's just a tool on a belt for traders. In some areas it can just be a self-fullfilling prophecy, but the edge it can give you is an edge I'd personally - under consideration of my personal circumstances - take over the \"hodl\" meme or plain old DCA any day.",

And I know we\u2019re at 2 years away before whether he has to eat his dick (end of 2020 means by Dec. 31st 2020)...so if Bitcoin hits $990,000 by Dec. 31, 2020 then he has to eat his dick since he said $1M. This is who McAfee is...his thoughts and predictions are entirely FOMO-driven. In the beginning of 2017, he predicted $500K by end of 2020 which is still impractical but 50% more practical than $1M. Why would anybody take advice from a sociopathic, drug-abusing, murderous pedophile? His white privilege and affluence is the only reason he\u2019s not sitting behind bars getting that tight old white hole of his raped on the daily.

Every day, your dumbass acts like Bcash has singlehandedly crashed Bitcoin as if it has that ability with its relatively lowly $6 billion market cap. The crypto market was at $210 bill. How can some altcoin that has a 3% share of the whole crypto market have that type of influence? It\u2019s like poor whites blaming black Americans for their problems instead of politicians and laws even though they have no interaction with black people. BCashBeTrash I don\u2019t think you learned a single thing in this subreddit. You are the Bitcoin Billy Madison, you get dumber by day and miseducate everyone around you.

They don't know shit about public interest, image and demand. They are focused on technique and stuff, but nobody gives a shit about it, it's all hype. That's why all alts went up in 2017.

If you're thinking $600 over the next month invest $300 today.\n\nPersonally, I think that it won't go much lower than this ever again. But it's possible that it could go down more. Below 4K seems very unlikely as there are so many millions of people with wealth who would be picking up bitcoin ten at a time. There's a huge difference between 6k and 3K. As many have said before, 4K seems like a realistic lower level fire sale unless people give up completely on bitcoin or it gets hacked. ",

Frankly, I am not sure that there is a minimum value of Bitcoin, as by nature the total crypto market is an expansionary currency (i.e. the system works with new tokens being created. Not necessarily Bitcoins, which eventually stop growing, but for others there will have to always be growth). This means that since the currency supply is always growing the value must be always decreasing, otherwise you have an infinite growth in value. Based on that, there is really no reason to assume any floor on value.",

There likely wont be a case of \"bigger fool\" like it was last year.\n\nFor most of people, crypto is scam that got them burned hard. There is no magic  in Bitcoin. Its slow as shit when used frequently (if you can call that frequent, back in December it was CRAWLING), it is not environmentaly friendly, it is not simple or safe to use and it scales like shit.\n\nSooner people use their brains and see that the amount that needs to be sold (big whales looking to sell) and people waiting or thinking of buying is crazy disproportional, the better.

            "Text": ">but how are we going to get there?\n\nBy accepting that we have to take Bitcoin's hard blows and painful lows if we want to take her high gains and ten year growth. People who are trolling on this sub and criticizing Bitcoin probably only bought it in the past year. People who are happy and bought it previous to last year are not on here whining. Bitcoin is growing but it's been cyclical since start. You don't see ETF's being proposed, New York Stock Exchange getting involved and the SEC taking things seriously if it were just tulips like the moron trolls post. They have little in life to make them happy, so they troll. Ignore them and look at the big piture - there's a very good reason why every time some increases in value, people say \"only the lucky ones got in early\". Trust me, this is early.",

So much more unimaginable utility is going to be developed on layer two technology, like the Lightning Network and Liquid. Lightning will allow secure value to stream across the internet as effortlessly and regularly as data. Liquid will allow other assets (like deeds of physical ownership, legal papers, copyright, etc.) to be pegged to bitcoin's secure network.",

            "Text": "Why would you not expect this?  It's simple math.  We have plenty of examples of bubbles to look at, crypto and non-crypto.  Looking at the bubbles that had a recovery and another run, we can look for mean/average/patterns.   I sent out an email to a few close friends, laying out the case for BTC being a buy, post 2017 bubble, between $2500 and $6000.    And the $6000 would be highly optimistic as a bottom.  And $2500 being if a global economic down turn coincided with crypto problems and fundamentals.  I figured $3800 was a good buy in.  Then I saw this subreddit, and omg, the stupidity, and utter ignorance, and non-reasoned, non-logical, full-on-emotional discourse that substituted for debate.   Anyway, the early (months ago) dip to 6k, and then the follow up touchdowns to 6k-ish, formed an unlikely pattern that when adding in the weird volumes and defiance of solid high-percentage predicted elliot wave moves,  I knew that 6k was a total farce, and the judgment day for btc would be much harsher due to the systemic widespread propping up of the price, for countless months.  This is because there's not really a large/diverse enough number of crypto holders.  And the chart distortion shows it.  The whales, the infrastructure players (miners, nvidia, datacenters, etc), the exchanges,   ....they're all desperate for price and volume increases.  Without those increases, the consequences would be dire.  They had every reason to prop up the price.  Exchanges (not just crypto but all exchanges, gold, sheep, stock markets) are notorious for some really fucked up behavior, the smaller ones tend to bury themselves, because they get caught up in the spread during the down turn and increased volatility.  So look around, everyone and their mother made their crypto plans based on the absolute most optimistic numbers, and had no plan if things did not go that way.  This is where the weak are going to be shaken out.  The real shake out is just beginning.",

Due to scarcity (and the fact that the population is gradually expanding), everything would slowly get cheaper.\n\nWhich means that there's no point buying 1 Bitcoin of materials to make a product because by the time you go to sell it, the finished product is now worth less than 1 Bitcoin.\n\nSo even if you could magically make Bitcoin the dominant currency overnight, the economy would then immediately starve to death because it's more expensive to do anything than do nothing.",

It generated panic selling and triggered bots.  If he wanted to simply fund hash buys/shifts with measured BTC sales then you would want maximum price returns, not announce to the world you were going to crash the price.  He\u2019s using the entire community and every investor to fund his selfish bullshit.  Worse, the SEC will look at this as manipulation and any commissioner on the fence for the ETF vote is now concerned.   It even takes the bullish potential out of BAKT, those potential buyers will not jump hard on an asset that just lost 30% and Warren Buffett calls rat poison.   It\u2019s an incredibly shitty downward spiral that the fuckers on BCH created. ",

What makes this specific drop to 5K an opportunity and not just another gamble on an uncertain future? What is different about now than the last few major dips? It all seems based in uncertainty and is basically a gamble. I mean, how many people are accurately predicting the price over long periods of time? Every upvoted comment I ever see says \"Oh, there is no way it will go below X. Now is the time to invest and be greedy!\", then a month later it is way below X.",

They didn't understand bitcoin, they didn't care about what it was, it was a lottery ticket to them.  Some folks I know got in, some are still holding hoping they'll be made whole again.  But those folks general attitude is \"Oh man I was dumb and bought into the mania.\" \n\nBut, that's the public's take away about Bitcoin now, it was a scam/a bubble/a ponsi scheme/tulip mania.  That's why you won't see them come back.  The resistance to repeating 2017 is tremendous now and every inch bitcoin loses increases the resistance to returning to any kind of ATH.\n\nBlockchain may have some future, for now it seems it was a very buzzy techmeme in 2017 that is already losing a bit of it's gas, but it's likely not as a non-state distributed currency.  Bitcoin though looks like it's going to lose value until it reaches the point that it's remaining value is what it's always been - a black market currency for ransomware authors and selling illicit goods online.  That activity defines it's true global value, not the speculation. \n\nSo, it's unlikely to ever go to zero, that activity and the remaining true believers/hodlers will keep it alive.  But the public has already soured on it.",

            "Text": "I didnt say you only comment when it drops. My point is that this is a common rhetoric to those who whine when value drops. If one could magically predict the ATL, then yeah, your comment would be valid. \n\nBut, Ive been seeing these types of posts from 19k all the way down to now, and in hindsight, none of them have been valid. Itd make sense to invest now, but youll be beating yourself up if it falls to 3.5k and sits there for a year or two.\n\nYeah, btc will one day likely climb back up well past 19k. One day. And anyone who was dumb enough to buy at 19k last December, and dumb enough to hodl that all the way through this dip, for however many years it takes for btc to make said climb, is going to have gains well overshadowed by anyone who buys at the initial stages of the next climb, or by any human being that partakes in any other type of investing in the years that will span this gap that btc is currently in.",

It's easy to say people fucked up when looking with hindset, but with the knowledge they had at the time I feel an argument could be made for either case on whether it was stupid or not or if it was just greedy or whatever.\n\nHowever, I also think it depends on how much of your portfolio is in it and whether you could afford to lose it. If it's 1% of your networth, and you aren't living paycheck to paycheck, then who cares? If it's 200% of your networth because you refinanced your house to trade with leverage, well, yeah you made multiple mistakes. ",

Cipher space, who would you rather get your predictions from...someone like cryptogrip who does no TA and just copies and pastes Bitcoin tabloid predictions or someone like me who does thorough technical analysis from a daily, weekly and monthly standpoint, observes historical data, reviews current buy sell walls, understands the best days and times of the week to buy and sell Bitcoin, etc... That\u2019s why my predictions this year have been right. I predicted Bitcoin will fall to the $4K before making another small run to the $7Ks before crashing again to $3600-$4200 range. The next time Bitcoin hits $20K, it will far kill that number. It won\u2019t stop at $20K like last time...it will be part of the major bull run. All my predictions have been right.

Many people in the world can't access a credit card as easily as Americans can (let alone a bank account), and their national currency is not as liquid as USD. But those people can access the internet, and that's enough to use cryptocurrencies. Visit any world capital with a second tier currency (ie, not GBP, USD, EUR), and you will see signs for bitcoin on every major shopping street.\n\nMost people currently pay 2.5%+ and possibly other fees for changing between national currencies. The more can be done in one currency, the more money they can save. Americans don't realize the value crypto has for the new middle class living in the former Soviet countries and East Asia. Bitcoin is becoming that one currency for many people that live internationally, like freelancers that work online for a company or clients in other countries.\n\n>I want a middleman in my transactions so I can track transfer and have a  legal way to revert if the other side screws me over or if the  transaction gets screwed up.\n\nThis doesn't go away with cyrpto. There will still be a secondary market for off-chain middlemen that provide such services. But with crypto, you have the option of using them or on-chain transactions. You like using cash for some transactions, so why not digital cash for other transactions?",

Bitcoin is valued on its future potential and it is also extremely cyclical. Price outgrows infrastructure, then price pulls back and infrastructure outgrows price ...rinse and repeat. It's much like the internet, and that's based on my years in this space and my years of gains and losses on internet companies years ago. \nBasically, everyone thinks that as soon as people start buying Bitcoin more the price will soar but it's alot that happens before the prior to make this possible. Once revenue is generated using the Bitcoin network, just like it us using the internet, then value exists. Since there was no 'internet token' back in the day, we are all new to the process of valuing Bitcoin. Make no mistake though, regardless of what happens with the current price ..bitcoin is here to stay and that price will increase drastically over coming years.",

People are willing to settle for (relatively) low-reward mutual funds and the like in their 401k because they want to have rock-solid confidence that their retirement isn't going to go up in smoke. When your survival is on the line, slow and steady is way more appealing than \"to the moon!\" gambling.\n\nThere is no way a company investing people's retirement money would make any sort of bet on the current cryptocurrency market. Just take a look at that company that lost a ton of money on a natural-gas bet yesterday for the level of shame you get for screwing up a portfolio on a high-risk bet. 50% swings in value are fun to clown around with when you've got a couple hundred bucks to burn on the weekend but not when you need a new house.",

It's easy to say people fucked up when looking with hindset, but with the knowledge they had at the time I feel an argument could be made for either case on whether it was stupid or not or if it was just greedy or whatever.\n\nSure, in hindsight its easy to say, but did we all think it was realistic it was gonna keep mooning? You made a decision not to sell, no one else. And now you live with the consequences, however severe that may be; for some 1%, for others they could be on overdue rent. Its not immature to say you didn't fuck up, making excuses and acting salty for it is. Investing in bitcoin is almost like gambling, did you know it was going up or down? What information did you base it on? Whatever that may be its probably wrong because you would've sold it back then if you had correct info. Therefore, choosing to invest in bitcoin is like gambling, you bet a good amount and you lost the bet: \"Oh yea its not immature to say I fucked up because I could've totally mooned with my bet\"",

            "Text": "I can value a stock by its expected return (ultimately based on the profits of the company and the dividends it can issue), currencies are non-productive assets and the only thing that makes them a store of value is their utility as a medium of exchange. So the question I think of is how needed this utility is (i.e. as medium of exchange). I think the answer is a lot less then the current value reflects. Further, the value of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange is problematic as the nominal amount of crypto (not just Bitcoin, but all of them) likely has to keep on increasing, meaning that for a given level of utility the constant increase would be driving down the fundamental value of individual coins or tokens. So while FOMO may drive up an asset, it does not affect the fundamental issues that the valuation of Bitcoin poses.",

People have sell orders in, and some people just get sick of seeing thier money disappear month after month. So they sell after they see the dip I'm price which you caused by selling.\n\nIf you have enough money and do this process a few time you're going to shake out lots of weak hand. Lots of them.\n\nOnce you're happy with the price you then start to accumulate  Bitcoin  OTC for cheap prices like 5k. Maybe you'll even throw a few big buys on an exchange just to kickstart the next bullrun and get all the people you shook out to fomo back in. \n\nThis is one Institution with deep pockets.

            "Text": "there are many individuals and investors with longer term investment horizons with different risk/return requirements. with the 401k vehicle, individuals make their investment elections and are directly responsible for their portfolio's performance, not the company. I'd bet there are a lot of younger people with a greater risk appetite who would invest in a crypto fund if included in their company's 401k fund menu. Why not allocate 5% and see if it pays off one day? I would and know a lot of other people who would too. Fidelity alone has 20 million individual customers. And institutions that manage other people's money like pension funds or those that have other mandates like university endowments make allocations to riskier asset classes all the time so long as they understand them and trust their counter-parties and custodians. While Baktt and Fidelity are laying that groundwork, these groups are already jumping in. Yale's CIO David Swensen just placed a couple big bets.

I could go on forever but starting out in a niche environment, improved via layering and protocols, considered useless at first, laying down groundwork for future potential, being criticized for its energy use, bottle-necked due to processing power of the day, and so much more I could literally be here for ages typing the more technical similarities involved with the open source contribution and review.\nThe biggest thing is that people almost always fail to see potential until it is realized. So when I feel I see a glimpse of potential I invest. It's worked out great for me so far (fingers crossed). For example, just a few days ago $600 million in BTC was sent overseas for a cost of 7 bucks in fees in minutes. If you're aware of what this normally costs in time and fees, you can see just one of many potential uses of BTC.",

I highly doubt you are going to fund a single manager who thinks that a bitcoin fund is an appropriate option for their employees. You might say, \"oh, why do **they** get to decide what you do with **your** money?\". Keep in mind a lot of people have no real interest in learning about investments. This is usually why investment options are safe, boring, broad index funds and target date retirement funds. Your 401k isn't meant for gambling, it's a vehicle to build safe, long-term growth for your retirement.",

As a final note I'll add that inflation hasn't risen in hyper mode only due to USD status as a reserve currency (for the n'th time, please learn to read), thus circulating around the globe. As soon as it's all going to go back to the local economy, prices are going to rise proportionally to the circulating USD note sum, triggering hyperinflation just like in Germany after WW1, only there the hyperinflation was triggered by people suddenly starting to spend their savings. As soon as retailers realized that the money supply vastly overshadows product supply, they started increasing the prices. This led to continuous printing in order for people to be able to afford basic food staples and for the economy to function at all. \n\nAt the end the central bank couldn't print enough, so it allowed municipalities to help print money. Inflation was so rapid that they ran out of paper. As a result they even had notes on pieces of clothing and even wood. \n\nThis time governments are smarter and therefore either repatriating the gold they own from US in exchange for soon to be worthless USD or buying up whatever they can so that their currencies actually have some value later on.\n\nBut you keep your paper money, dummy.",

Is it changing my game plane even though it isnt? Nope. Am I an OG? Nope. Just hit 1 year in the market in like october. It's a fun a little roller-coaster to observe, and I get little dopamine hits when I see the price swing in either direction. If it goes up, I see the value go up. If I see it go down, then I think of the potential for it to go back up and the resulting gains from it.",
