I did a lot of reading and the largest con of investing in BTC was the large energy consumption (like the yearly energy consumption of Chech Republic). Could you please give me some arguments why you are still supporting BTC, while it uses such a large part of energy in these times of global warming? I really try to understand it, and I like to hear the story from both sides. On the one side I think you can read some great arguments by u/hodor7777 [https://xrpcommunity.blog/proof-of-work-cryptos-will-be-left-behind/](https://xrpcommunity.blog/proof-of-work-cryptos-will-be-left-behind/)\n\n&#x200B;",

Even if it's much less, it's good.\n\nIf bitcoin miners buy the green energy surplus, maybe it'll actually support the industry of green energy. Obviously I'm not saying Bitcoin helps the environment, but it's not as bad as it seems.\n\nAlso, note that Bitcoin's every consumption is not linear. We don't need to spend more energy to secure the network, even if we have 10x the volume.\n\nI think Lightning Network is a very good solution, since it uses the main Bitcoin network for consensus when needed. I think we should have only one POW network, and have sidechains and layer 2 protocols for different things.",

Gold has been an excellent store of value for centuries precisely because you have to spend energy to obtain it: prospect to find ore bodies, drill to verify the gold is there, construct and operate a mine, and process the ore to extract the gold. It also has other key properties: i.e. it does not degrade, is malleable, difficult to fake, etc.\n\nThe development of bitcoin is intentionally extremely conservative, and the \"proof of work\" (PoW) hashing algorithm that mimics the energy expenditure of gold mining is the most secure, fair, and proven (tested for over 10 years now) means of securing the network. \n\nOther cryptocurrencies are experimenting with alternatives and modifications to PoW, and that's great. There are many reasons to believe that alternatives could work as well or better than PoW so it's great that there is so much experimentation going on.\n\nBut bitcoin isn't about experimentation. The goal is to ensure that above all else, it functions as an effective store of value.",

I guess the opinion of bitcoin all has to do with when you got in and what you got out of it. Me personally it was a smart move and game changer my initial investment that got me going. I have not put any fiat into this market in many years and i wont ever again. Not a reason to at this point i used btc for large purchases which it was intended and i had cashed enough out ..if it all went to ZERO i personally can still never complain..still smile actually..If the market does return again there will be many more who will think exactly the same i'm sure..",

Btc doesn't have an underlying value. Gold is also not suitable as a currency. Btc neither because of fixed supply. So what's left for btc? Not so much. It's neither a reliable store of value because of high speculation and volatility. So as much as people want btc to succeed, it seems it doesn't have much future. It has a past where it attracted people into crypto because of brandname, but the future is looking very bad for btc. People are pulling their money out cause it has completely failed to have a usecase and underlying value. ",

            "Text": "Where does the value come from? Quite simple. It's a psychological game. If I can convince you to give me your fiat for some magic beans, then I have convinced you that bitcoin is real and has value. Now, say I convince you that instead of Bitcoin, Amazon coin is better than Bitcoin, then more people will buy Amazon Coin and Amazon coin will be more 'valued'. \n\nThe reason Bitcoin shot to 20k was because of the promoted gossip on the street. Not because it has any real value at all, but because suddenly more people heard rumors and gossip and bought. It didn't matter what they bought. You could have sold macaroni necklaces. What happend though was that the world heard of this new thing, and wanted some. Suddenly there was a demand, and the price went through the roof. It had zero value just as macaroni necklaces have value. But because the people suddenly wanted it, that's the actual value. The demand is the value. If suddenly nobody wants bitcoin anymore, then it becomes worthless. I absolutely love Bitcoin because it's not actually about money or currency at all. It's about technology, that was then altered to make it profitable. It didn't need to be a currency at all. It could just have been a cool tech, but someone specifically made it about money for a reason. It was marketed for a reason, and it went to 20k because of the wow factor. All of those things are gone now. It's an amazing idea and I will still own some. But if the public never buys into it, or even uses it, then it becomes an exercise in a great idea that didn't catch on.",

            "Text": "> Gold has an underlying value. People make jewelry, wedding rings, decorations etc.\n\nYou've got it backwards. Gold jewelry is prized because gold as a store of value symbolizes wealth and status. The few narrow industrial applications of gold are insignificant and irrelevant to its value as money. \n\n> Gold is also not suitable as a currency. \n\nGold was and is used as a currency. It is challenging to transact very large or very small amounts hence it is rarely used. Distributed ledgers might change that, but that's another story.\n\n> It's neither a reliable store of value because of high speculation and volatility.\n\nVolatility creates risk, but does not negate BTC's properties that make it an effective store of value. \n\n> It has a past where it attracted people into crypto because of brandname, but the future is looking very bad for btc. People are pulling their money out cause it has completely failed to have a usecase and underlying value.\n\nYou sound very confused. BTC has maintained it's value better than almost any other coin in this bear market. There are many use cases even today, and it's still early in development.",

Look back at all other fiat currencies throughout time, start alphabetically and ask what their value is today? I'll give you a hint, when ur halfway through the letter B, you will of looked at over 600 Different currencies, all of which are currently valued at 0.00$ the Only thing that has survived well over 5000 years is gold/silver.  Gold/silver so far is THE  only type of money that checks off all the box's to be \"sound money\"  a medium of exchange, a unit of account, portable, durable, divisible, fungible and a store of value over time.  \n\nI would say BTC is an interesting experiment to attempt to re-create those classifications of \"gold\" in a digital form, the two issue's at the moment are medium of exchange and store of value over time. simply put, not enough time has passed, and not enough people accept it as payment so we don't know how true/false it is.  Yes the value has gone up A lot over time (depending when you bought of course) but on golds timescale it isnt even a blip on the chart. \n\nThe other issue BTC has to overcome is while it currently solves the double spend problem through PoW, it will have to stand up to quantum computers which threaten to simply rewrite the entire blockchain in a short moment.  Moores law and Time are not on Bitcoins side, massive developments and improvements will be needed (and no im not talking about lightning network)\n\nTLDR; Gold > every currency in existence ever, BTC will have to fight Time and Moore's law to survive/prove it is \"sound money\"",

People like to come up with reasons for value in gold with jewelry etc., and bitcoin with network value, etc.. Hell, I'm guilty of it myself! But the bottom line is that network value may help drive demand, but it is the demand itself that actually creates the value.  ",

It is fundamentally different to the majority of other cryptocurrencies.\n\none of bitcoin's main points is to be a decentralised currency which cannot be controlled or censored by any authority or group. it is easy to create a digital currency with fast payments and low fees, and which appear to fix shortcomings in bitcoin. You can find hundreds of such currencies now, and in fact methods using traditional government-controlled currencies do a reasonable job of it these days, if all you're interested in is convenience.\n\nWhat isn't easy, is to do all this while maintaining decentralisation, with everyone independently verifying all transactions and enforcing consensus rules, with no central authority being able to dictate the rules or being able to censor any transactions. This is what bitcoin is aiming to do, and while it may be the oldest, it is continually improving through new developments such as the Lightning Network. Achieving this also requires a large distributed network to work and to maintain security, which is where being the oldest really comes into play. It's reliability has been proven over the last 10 years, and it has survived all forms of attacks.\n\nBefore falling for the hype of better-than-bitcoin alternatives, I would suggest taking a bit more time to understand why bitcoin was created in the first place.",

In fact bitcoin is still considered the best use of blockchain, and this opinion comes from some of the top minds of developers in the space. \n\nIf there's one thing that is critical to understand, it's that Bitcoin is far more likely to be improved, not replaced. Listen to a few interviews with developers like Jimmy Song for more insight into this. Things like Lightning Network are just the beginning of years if improvements via layers and upgrades coming down the pipe. People who think bitcoin will be replaced are probably reading this in fud clickbait articles, particularly older articles, as that was a popular fud angle for a while last year. Anyone still thinking this does not fully grasp the difference between bitcoin and shitcoins. Most of them are ideas, created to generate profits.",

Bitcoin like all crypto has a scalability issue but bitcoins scalability issues seem more dire than most others.  I hope I\u2019m wrong but I read an article on coindesk that discusses this very thing and the author makes a good point that bitcoin may inevitably become a natural monopoly.

There can be as many forks as people want.  You can't stop people and projects from creating new cryptographic networks.  Game theory has no impact on people's right to code up new cryptographic networks - most of which are far better than the 'model T' of crypto.  \n\n\n\n\n",
