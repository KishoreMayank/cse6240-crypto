Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425.\n\nAn unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800\u2013$8,000.\n\nOnly a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.",

            "Text": "Personally I think it's still a technical correction. I've spent the past week researching pretty heavy on bitcoin over the past few years. The one conclusion I came to is people have absolutely no idea what the price is going to do. Just last year when the price began to run there were all of these sell articles and comments about 3,000. Oh my gosh it made a huge run get out get out. Now that happened all the way to 20,000 but it happened a lot less in the last $10,000. The human mind is genetically programmed to spot patterns. It could be something hereditary. Who knows but we all do it. That's useful with some things but with markets it creates a bias. The price run in 2017 to $3,000 was probably the most fearful of all. The correction that happened later that year also sparked a ton of fear. Why that earlier run was so important is because it came off of a reasonable bear Market where the price didn't really do anything so when the price began to behave differently people literally panicked. If you have the time study a lot of the posts on bitcointalk and online and go back a few years. The most interesting part of all is the crowd was most often wrong. They were fearful when they should have been greedy and greedy when they should have been fearful. When I look out the window right now in the crypto Market you know what I see? A ton of fear.",

If Bitcoin replace those method of payement all that energy will be spared. Also when bitcoin goes stable and the energy spend securing the network is enough to render any attack too expensive to be successfull. There will be no incentive to make it more secure than it should be \\(let say the miner rewards get in equilibrium as well so no extra miner have incentive to get into the game and drive the difficulty of the network any higher\\).\n\nthen Bitcoin will be sucessfull.\n\nFunny thing is, if Bitcoin doesn't go to an exagerated value, there will be no incentive to mine or secure the network more than it should be. It's a self regulated phenomenon that still need to converge to an equilibrium.\n\n\\- A stable BTC will have enough miner to secure the network without incentive to add more miners.\n\n\\- an overevaluated BTC need more security, but more miner will join in because it get more profitable.\n\n\\- an underevaluated BTC doesn't need more security because the benefit of attacking the network isn't worth it, and miner will leave the network because it isn't profitable for them anymore.\n\nThe difficulty adjustment is taking care of all that.\n\nUnless a significant par of the network is leaving at the same time wich would decrease the confirmation time for a period of 2 weeks. And even that could be taken care of\\-chain by the LN Network.\n\nAlso, the provider of electricity will adjust their rate following environemental requirements that might change in the future should the situation get out of control. That will also change the cost of securing the network \\(driving miner out of the equation and driving the price of BTC to a new lower equilibrium\\).\n\nThis electricity consumption is moot because how much energy bank are spending to secure your cash?\n\nHow much energy banks and payement provider are spending in their high rise building all over the world?\n\nYour peer reviewer article needs to put thoses value against each other to declare any winner.",

After all, the cashier who sells sth to you is paid in fiat, the goods are paid for in fiat etc. The real market appears to me to be international. I read just yesterday of a fine arts house in London which accepts bitcoin. Suppose an item is sold by a european (Eurozone), sold in London for GBP, bought by an American.  Say the sale price is 1 million, I would guess the transfers/ fees of $ to GBP to Euro would be 3-4% of the transaction amount. If the buyer can use BTC, and especially if the seller accepts BTC then it makes sense all round.",

When you are a miner you(your pool) spend a lot of energy and when you find a block you are granted the block reward (value decreasing has the time goes by) this is creating new BTC on the network and you are allowed to insert in your block some of the transactions sitting in the mempool. To optimize the return of your investment you\u2019ll pick the most profitable transaction (highest paying) to be inserted in the next block. This is a bit like the knapsack problem. With time, because the block reward is diminishing, the miners will only have the transaction cost to compensate them for the cost of their effort. When the block reward will be close to zero, they will not be printing new BTC anymore and will \u201conly\u201d have the role of securing the network.",

            "Text": "Retailers currently pay 3% fees on credit card sales. I think Bitpay charges 1%? \n\nNevertheless, there is little incentive for consumers to make payments with bitcoin instead of a credit card. The only exceptions are purchases for gray market or illegal products, but other currencies have better fungibility than Bitcoin for such transactions.\n\nThis is why Btrash is such a joke. It literally has no use-case whatsoever.\n\nIMO, Bitcoin has a competitive advantage in the area of cross-border money transfers because it avoids banks' currency conversion fees, which from personal experience can amount to up to 8% above market rate.",

Their lives are so miserable that the only thing they know how to do is try and spread that misery to others. I don't think you trolling type realize how destructive being this way is on your own mind. The laughs that you get are actually programming yourself to get off on negativity.

The vast majority of companies that are accepting it do so as a publicity stunt.  Let's say you owned a Lamborghini dealership and actually accepted Bitcoin.  When someone purchased a car with Crypto, would you keep the Crypto or convert back to fiat as soon as possible to avoid the downside risk of losing your profit or even more?  For instance, lets say you sold a $400k Lambo a month ago with $60k in profit.  You held on to the crypto and instead of being up $60k, you are now down $40k.  I am one who believes big government and big banks have far too much control over our lives and would like to see an alternative succeed but doubt it ever will.  Sure there is value in blockchain but ultimately, the tech is free.  Crypto will be regulated by big governments one way or the other whether users want it to be or not.  I currently have no skin in the game but I made the Ponzi Scheme statement to get people to think.  If it sounds to good to be true...",

You have a lot of people who probably bought when the price was quite a lot higher and now they are feeling despair which is the last part of the bear cycle. Usually once they sell there is a feeling of relief. At that point they may remain pessimistic as doing so helps them justify what they did. Around that point in time the price usually turns around and begins to go up again. Then they experience the next thing. Disbelief. I could keep going with this cycle but it happens again and again and again throughout history. Personally I believe the Bitcoin story is going to do one of two things. It's either going to go one hell of a lot higher or it's on its way to zero. Even if it is on its way to zero that's not going to happen anytime soon. You may notice none of the big money investors are heading for the door. Retail investors are taking off but you don't hear about the Winklevoss twins selling. Hell they are probably buying. Beings this Market is unregulated I can tell you with a fairly High degree of certainty the way it would end. Another price run will take place and it will go above the last. It's hard to say how much but probably at least 25,000. While that Euphoria is building and when we take out those previous highs a lot of people are going to come into the market. That's exactly where you will see the big holders begin to push their coins and sell off. The last thing those people are going to do is unload into a bear market",

            "Text": "I think the bottom line is if more people feel like you do this whole project will collapse. Pessimism will Doom everything it touches. This project can very easily succeed in one of two ways. One is a store of value and the other is a digital Cash System. In order for number 2 to happen the value of each coin has to be a hell of a lot higher than it is. That will draw in more investment and more development . regulation absolutely has to happen. If we continue in this death spiral it's likely you're going to read a news article that Goldman Sachs changed their mind about setting up a crypto desk. You're going to see the 200-plus hedge funds start to close up. Then it might be a race for the door between the big money investors like the Winklevoss twins. If that happens the project is over. But it doesn't have to go that way. Development can continue. People are worried about how the regulations are going to go right now. You also have the question on when the lightning network is going to be fully operational and out of the beta phase. You don't even really need a firm date on that you just need progress to continue to happen. Personally I really want to see this project succeed. I love the idea behind it.",

BTC finally get stable at x USD and doesn't move anymore than \\+\\-0.5&#37; on a monthly basis and is unafected by the news because everyone knows that it isn't going to the moon and isn't going to be banned because it's now legit for everyone everywhere.\n\nA lot of people might still have some BTC they've purchased significantly more \\(x in this exemple\\). These will be the final bagholders and will never recoup their \"investment\".\n\nWhat will the value of x be? but it has to converge to a stable value no matter what this value may be or no one will use it for anything else than a speculative asset.\n\nFor the moment if you want to use it as a currency, you have to spend and replenish for BTC to artificially be stable for you. For this use case, depending on your country you'll be spending more money and time doing it than using traditionnal debit card or cash valued in FIAT.\n\nI don't think any legitimate business will use any liquidity to do this. They will use their liquidity to do business wise decision like pumping it into R&D to develop their next product that'll put them ahead of the competition, buy another company whose product offering will help them against their competitors, pay dividend to their shareholder to had value into owning a share in the company and keep the value of their share high, ...\n\nI don't think the shareholder of big tech companies will appreciate having the liquididy of the company being used recklessly and this will be visible in the quarterly/yearly results and will drive the value of the share to the ground.",

There was also nothing in the law that said the banks were too big to fail, these are major concerns. Main street got sold out, wall street got bailed out. \n\n>Second, fiat/stocks are not only regulated, but are protected by their rules. If someone robs your bank, the FDIC insures your loss. If someone lies in a report to shareholders, they can be prosecuted and sued.\n\nFirst off, the laws were written thanks to lobbying on the part of wall street. Just because corporate buy backs are legal, doesn't mean I want to play that game anymore.\nIn a nutshell, stock repurchases or \"buybacks\" are just a way for corporations to pay executives and other employees at the stockholder's expense. At first glance it looks like companies are paying money to loyal shareholders when they buy back shares of stock. However, don't forget that companies also give stock options to executives and other employees, and these options end up putting new shares of stock back in to the market. When an executive exercises his stock options, he is essentially getting brand new shares of stock for an older, lower price, and then immediately selling them to the market at the higher current market price.\n\nThat's all legal, and it's bullshit.\n\n>The dollar is accepted everywhere and is far more stable in value than a BTC.\n\nMight be accepted everywhere but the stability of the dollar is an illusion, otherwise I could buy a Ford for 1922 prices.\n\n>So BTC is not a better currency. And BTC is not a replacement for a properly diversified wealth growth strategy.\n\nBTC is not just a currency, but regardless if you're so sure it's just tulip-mania, then you should short it.\n\n>You have admitted you aren't using it for method #1 -- so all that is left is gambling, whether you want to admit it or not.\n\nCall it gambling, IDGAF. I'm voluntarily investing my money in btc, and I've yet to lose money. My experience with gambling is people tend to drink alcohol, play a game and lose money.",

In exchange for a 10 billion euro loan, deposits worth more than the insured limit of 100,000 euros at the Bank of Cyprus and smaller lender Laiki were raided in a so-called bail-in to prop up the country's teetering banking sector.\n\n>The savings raid prompted Cypriot authorities to impose restrictions on money withdrawals and transfers for all banks to head off a run. Christopher Pissarides, the Nobel laureate who heads the government's economic advisory body, forecast Monday that the bank controls could be in place for another two years.\n\nThis can't happen with bitcoin. \n\nAnd before you say that this is all happening outside of the US, and would never happen in the US... let me remind you the entire global financial system is linked. When Greece went under we feel it here. \n\n>Italy\u2019s political convulsions have raised new fears about the future of the euro, the single currency of the European Union that was introduced 16 years ago.\n\n>The possibility, however remote, that a populist Italian government would renounce the euro and revive the lira currency has unnerved many bankers and investors. Stocks tumbled on Tuesday on the fears, and the euro fell against the dollar to its weakest level in six months.\n\nSo what happens in Italy affects the stock market here. What happens in Greece and China affects the stock market here, because algorithms and high frequency trading are the norm, and we don't have true price discovery anymore. \n\nBtc is a completely different animal and trying to compare it to fiat is like trying to compare CERN with a carrot.

Just free advice you can freely ignore.\n",
