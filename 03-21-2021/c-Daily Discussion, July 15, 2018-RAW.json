Here it comes...President Donald Trump...He even showed him the message that DT sent him a year a go....now that's interesting is it not? I would love to see that message that DT sent but can comprehend why he would not want to share it with others....But my wrestling buddy saw it himself and I trust him fully....so there ya have it...DT believes in Bitcoin ",

That is how the whole idea of a blockchain works, as every wallet is visible within the wallet. That is why Bitcoin is considered   pseudo-anonymous.\n\nThe reason why is because FIAT is not anonymous, so when you change your bitcoin into FIAT you kind of give it away. There is no way you can be tracked inside Bitcoin if you aren't an idiot and give away indirect ways to show you own the coin.\n\nSame reason we haven't found Satoshi yet.\n\nSo nice try, but this has nothing to do with Bitcoin but with FIAT",

            "Text": ">How long until we scan our bitcoin wallets and avoid the logging in and buying then going to the movies\n\nHow is that better than a regular mobile payment app that uses fiat? Almost everything in China is paid for by scanning a QR code. The US is way behind technologically, but you can use apps like Apple Pay to buy things without logging in to anything. Contactless payments are also getting quite popular in Europe. It's mostly just the US  that still has a very slow and clunky payment system, but it can still do everything that bitcoin does.",

The same security and piece of mind as if you had paid with Cash. Apple pay, Android pay, etc all still surrender your personal information each time the phone is scanned.\n\n2) It is a pull transactions. Similar to a debit transaction. You can't do it if you can't pay for it. This means the company doesn't have to worry about charge backs or fraud. \n\n3) if LN is implemented it will cost the business next to nothing to accept payment via BTC vs traditional services that charge 1-3%.\n\n4) Decentralized/trustless. Don't have to rely on any company's systems to be functioning or denying the transaction etc. Visa and master card have both had down time recently where people were unable to use their cards. \n\nA combination of 2 & 3 means they could potentially give a discount and save money. In the example of a movie most places when you buy online charge you a \"convenience fee\" essentially that 1-3% the business is charged for allowing them to use their payment rails (visa/etc). with BTC they wouldn't need to charge that BS markup.",

The US system is definitely not as good and still rarely used. \n\nEven then, bitcoin hacks are far more common than credit card hacks, so the idea that bitcoin is more secure is rather absurd. When was the last time you heard about someone losing all their money because they accidentally downloaded a hacked version of Android pay? You have to trust every line of code in the bitcoin wallet app you are using, so you need to trust them far more than your mobile payment app. If your phone is stolen, you can just freeze your fiat payment apps without losing a dime, but your bitcoin wallet is stuck on the stolen phone.\n\nThe bitcoin payment system can't work without the lightning network, which still does not work at scale.\n\n>This means the company doesn't have to worry about charge backs or fraud.\n\nThat also means consumers have zero recourse when there is fraud. You need to have complete trust in the merchant since you have no way to cancel the transaction if they don't deliver. If you are robbed or hacked, you can cancel all your fiat transactions, but the bitcoin transactions are irreversible.",
