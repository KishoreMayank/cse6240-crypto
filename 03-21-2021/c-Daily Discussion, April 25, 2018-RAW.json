It has a great record of going up in value long term. Though I think annual gains can't be as extreme as it's been (if it continues the way it has it'll be worth the entire world's real estate in 8 years), it'll still increase long term in value, probably better than most stocks.\n\n4. If I hold USD long term I KNOW FOR A FACT it will lose value over time. Even in a savings account.\n\nHaving said that, If I were one of those people that took out a $40,000 credit card and needs the value to exceed 10K or they'll go bankrupt... I might consider selling, as there's no guarantee it will exceed 10K real soon.",

Whole 2017 I've fucking sold the same hour I received and was butthurting remembering how April 2017 I've sold 2 BTC for some shitting 2 thousands or so. Then all of the sudden I decide to hodl in January and here we are now... \n\nBut I've sold all of it (I need money anyway this month, so probably it wont hit 10k in April again), so expect ALL TIME HIGH knowing my luck. You welcome guys\n\nI just hate that I didn't sold 12 hours ago at 9700 :(",

If you buy for one month let's say 8,900 then the following month you buy at an average of 7,000. When that next pump happens and it jumps back to 8,900 or higher than your already making a profit. I look at is as a savings acct. A very risky one at that. You should have your safe one in a bank, 401k, etc and also have a small side one of crypto. In time it will grow, especially if you keep pumping Fiat into your wallet. It won't hurt and one day you will be surprised how much you've ammassed. It also is an addictive way to put money away and makes you want to save more in life. ",

            "Text": "the problem with bitcoin is a lot people who dont know how investing works are in this market, they expect it to only go up or only down, which is not the case in any market, but they don't understand, so when they see it go down a bit everyone panics and what should be a small dip turns into a crash, same thing in other direction, people see it go up and they all jump on because they don't want to miss out. People need to learn that time in the market is much better than timing the market. If you truly believe in what your investing in, then buy it and don't worry about short term numbers, but its hard to not worry about short term numbers when the masses move the market so much because they are too reactionary instead of longing like they should be",
