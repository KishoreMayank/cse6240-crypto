Because there is a huge market of people that would want to invest in crypto but don't know much about it, don't want to spend time on it, are afraid of losing their keys, afraid of being hacked, afraid of not able to control their emotions, etc. They will gladly hand over their money to banks like they do with stocks, to let other people invest for them. Banks are completely stupid if they don't take advantage of this potential market. This is what's going to happen within 3 to 5 years, when most of the milennium generation will enter the labor market and won't be so scared of new ways to invest like the older generation. They will be accustomed to crypto. So no, banks will not go away, neither will crypto. The biggest enemy of crypto will adopt it themselves and secure their existence by doing so. ",

Even if you were able to buy it anonymously somewhere the blockchain still will track back to where you purchased it and they will still be able to find out where you spent it if you wind up under investigation\n\nThe real draw with Bitcoin is the development with lightning and having a hard money transaction system with lower fees than credit cards. The most important thing really is being able to easily get your hands on bitcoin also with little to no fees. Ideally you would be able to push a button on your bank and send something across lightning. Maybe as this develops we will eventually get to that point.",

There was talk years ago about vulnerabilities on the open port (usually TCP Port 8333), but don't think much came out of that claim. UPnP works on the LAN level. It allows individual client machines on your LAN to open a required port on the WAN-side of the router. You can also accomplish this with port forwarding Port 8333 on your router to whichever machine is running the node on your home network...if you're comfortable with leaving that port open.\n",

It's even possible (though rare) for your network to be setup such that you can receive incoming connections even without UPnP or any manual port forwarding, so disabling UPnP is not a fool-proof way of *preventing* incoming connections.",

Scheduled hardforks to keep asic resistance vs fixed proof of work that leads to high hashrate via asic\n\n5.  Steeply reducing block reward though maintaining a tail emission vs gently reducing block reward\n\nNone of these (including the first one) are slam dunk in favour of one coin. You could argue every one of these, reasonably, in favour of either approach. Since the game theory as to who will win is rather hard to predict, what's not to like about having both? \n\nThese two are the gold standard of crypto.

            "Text": "It is clear that the reason for the cycles is hoarding of coins by hodlers who bought during last trough coupled with fomo from new buyers. Ultimately, at a peak many multiples of the trough, many hodlers dump their stash due to size of profits they are sitting on (pure prudent risk management). That triggers the opposite effect of price decrease reinforced by panic sells. Ultimately this cycle ends when panic triggers even hodlers who had not yet sold to dump out of fear of losing their still decent profits. This finally gets bitcoin into a more distributed state at a price low enough to tempt new hodlers. And the cycle then starts all over again.\n\nIf you think of it, it is unreasonable to think that the price of an asset like bitcoin can take any other trajectory other than the one described above. For example, tell me which of the above effects has a valid chance of not happening at all and thus to break the cycle of peaks and troughs? Do you think it is at all possible for price to keep on rising smoothly and if so, how can this square up with the effects I described above?\n\nAll that said, it is still not easy at all to predict what the peak and trough points will be in a cycle.",

They make some aspects easier, and they charge for that, but bitcoin exhanges/service providers have not, nor will ever be able to, insert themselves into the bitcoin ecosystem to the extent that they are unavoidable. If their practices are egregious, there are ALWAYS exchange-free alternatives. They exist, in a very real way, by the grace of their customers; which is not at all true of banks, e.g. there is no bank-free way to pay an employee other than handing over a stack of cash, buying a house without a bank being involved on either side, even if i was 'paying cash,' is laughable.

            "Text": ">Maybe not so absolute. Banks may very well find ways to give loans, with interest, in btc. A hybrid loan with a matching futures contract that gives the borrower the option to pay back the loan in fiat value at an extra cost. Similar to mortgage insurance. I mean, they are clever fellows, they'll work out the details.\n\nBanks are going to adopt crypto themselves. Why? Because there is a huge market of people that would want to invest in crypto but don't know much about it, don't want to spend time on it, are afraid of losing their keys, afraid of being hacked, afraid of not able to control their emotions, etc. They will gladly hand over their money to banks like they do with stocks, to let other people invest for them. Banks are completely stupid if they don't take advantage of this potential market. This is what's going to happen within 3 to 5 years, when most of the milennium generation will enter the labor market and won't be so scared of new ways to invest like the older generation. They will be accustomed to crypto. So no, banks will not go away, neither will crypto. The biggest enemy of crypto will adopt it themselves and secure their existence by doing so. ",
