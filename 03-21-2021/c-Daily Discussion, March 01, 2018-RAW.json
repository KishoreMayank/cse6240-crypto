There are no such thing as dormant  bitcoins - just funds that have not yet been spent.  I don't think you'll get the answer you're looking for because it isn't really possible (that I am aware of) to see definitively how much btc was transacted vs how much is sitting dormant besides using that days destroyed indicator to see how much old coin has been moved - older the coin, the more days destroyed.\n\n>definition of dormant is 'never withdrawal ever'\n\nbitcoin is a technology NOT AN EXCHANGE.. you don't withdraw bitcoin...you trade it to someone else for a good or service...just so happens that the most often traded good for bitcoin is fiat money.",

            "Text": "Here\u2019s what I do. Set up a Sell Stop Order on whatever exchange you are on (Coinbase uses GDAX) at $300 under the current price. For example now it\u2019s $10,950, so set it to sell your BTC at $10,600. Giving it $300 move space means if it reaches your sell price it is very likely going to go far beyond it. Once your money sells, Don\u2019t buy right back in give it an hour or so to make sure it doesn\u2019t drop farther (The FOMO gets very real here). Then if it looks like it\u2019s done dipping, buy in again (preferably with a Limit Buy so you don\u2019t pay any fees when you buy) Then wait for the price to go up about $500 and set a Stop Order. \n\nIf you buy under where you sold you will get more Bitcoin in your buy each time. You can\u2019t lose this way, but knowing when to buy is he hardest part.",

If the governments wanted to shut bitcoin down there is no person or a business they can go to and tell them to turn it off. There is no a single entity they can sue or prosecute.   \n   \n- With decentralised system there is also no a single point of failure. It you're running something on a server it can be hacked or shut down. With a decentralised network there is no single physical  point to attack.   \n   \n- With decentralised governance all decisions are based on the consensus of the majority, between parties often with conflicting interests. With centralised system there is a single entity responsible for making all decisions. They can make good decisions or bad, but they can also be bribed or blackmailed or work in best interest of a particular minority. In decentralised system the majority always wins.   ",

Bitcoin seeks to address the root problem with conventional currency: all the trust that's required to make it work -- Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate. Trust failures result in systemic collapses, trust curation creates inequality and monopoly lock-in, and naturally arising trust choke-points can be abused to deny access to due process. Through the use of cryptographic proof, decentralized networks and open source software Bitcoin minimizes and replaces these trust costs. \n\nFrom https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page",

Sell and buy prices never get updated to the market price during dips and rips, you always end up selling lower and buying higher than what the chart says. Also, during either dips or rips most of the times the order doesn't get filled at the desired price and you have to try again, always losing money in the process. Use Limit orders on GDAX instead.",

Ideally, you should also get a segwit-supported wallet to store your coins in, rather than keeping them on exchange, although I will admit I myself am guilty of keeping my coins on GDAX for extended periods of time with no issues.\n\nIf you want to actively trade, I would also recommend just hodling until you learn at least some basic technical analysis like support & resistance, trend lines and channels, and using a real exchange (like GDAX) over Coinbase. I highly recommend babypips.com to learn, it's for Forex markets but the majority of the skills are transferable across markets, and tradingview.com to use charts. Please also keep in mind that TA in isolation is nothing more than astrology, especially in a market like cryptocurrencies, but in my (albeit amateur) view it is equally as harmful to your trading to dismiss TA completely.

My take is that they dont want to get caught in Compliance, AML issues and dont want exposure should the market really crash while eliminating useless alts.\n\nMy base case hasnt change, cryptos are the future of money.

It's the other way around, totally. Too bad GDAX doesn't have an app on its own and the site is awkward on phone, but you can somewhat get used to it. On computer it's great. Seems intimidating at first but you'll get used to it in no time. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDp659_-yNU) for a simple tutorial and also have a look at the other videos of this guy.",

            "Text": "Coinbase has now implemented SegWit, allowing for smaller transaction fees. However, despite the fact that your coinbase account will display \"wallets\", and technically they are \"wallets\", that is not what we generally mean by the term, as in this case, the exchange is in charge of storing the coins and private keys. Even though Coinbase or other exchanges may promise to hold most of its reserves in cold (offline) storage, they cannot guarantee the safety or that they won't one day go poof and disappear with all of your digital wealth. If you do not own and have control over your own private keys, they are not your coins and **nobody** will help you if something happens to the exchange, eg. a big hack or bankruptcy . You should be using at least a wallet like [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) for smaller amounts or a ideally, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor for real amounts. How you quantify those amounts is up to you.\n\nYou can transfer fiat funds to Coinbase then to GDAX to purchase BTC, or you can deposit BTC to GDAX directly from your personal wallet.\n\nI would highly recommend watching some talks and Q&As by Andreas Antonopoulos to learn about the fundamentals (and philosophy) of bitcoin. You can find him on youtube under his [aantonop](https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop) handle, and some of his material has been reposted on [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/listentoandreas/) if you prefer a podcast format with no video so you can listen on the go.",

            "Text": "**Metcalfe's law**\n\nMetcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of \"compatible communicating devices\" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Similar to the internet itself: A world-wide information network that no company or government has control over. That wasn\u2019t possible without decentralisation. It was a neat idea back in the mid 90\u2019s but it really took off as people found new uses for it. \n\nWho knows what possibilities a world-wide decentralised payment platform will allow? That future value is what bitcoin investors like myself are betting on. ",

            "Text": "Don't forget situations like political confiscation, or financial crisis. They happen in to adults non-communist countries too.\n\nBack in 2007 in the last financial crisis, a big fear was that if banks went bust then the financial infrastructure would stop working (ATMs would close, bank transfer wouldn't work, etc, etc). With bitcoin we can have a working financial infrastructure regardless of what risks are taken by investment banks.\n\nAlso there's the privacy aspect. Transacting online with legacy methods always involves revealing your real life ID. So for example if you want to buy a VPN for privacy reasons, you always have to give up your real name when you pay with VISA. With bitcoin you can buy a VPN without giving up your real name. This works because decentralization gives rise to irreversible transactions, if you send bitcoins to somebody and they wait for enough confirmations then then nobody can take the bitcoin from you no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. This is a property that no centralized online payment system can *ever* have.\n\nFinally because payments are irreversible, it's possible to program the money with smart contracts. You could use smart contracts with centralized payment methods, but the central institution could always override them so it would be pointless. Smart contracts in bitcoin will always be followed no matter what.",

Are you trying to convey that Bitcoin is useless because at the end of the day most of the stakeholders have the intention to sell it back out for fiat dollars?  As someone who used to be a cryptocurrency maximalist in the past but am not one anymore, I see some of the limits of crypto - you can't issue fractional reserve debt and thus paths available to traditional lending by showing purchasing power through fiat holdings and collateral is not available to cryptocurrency users - that is probably the only realistic reason for why Fiat would still be needed from the context of a cryptocurrency holder (as in they hold more assets in crypto than in traditional fiat).  \n\nI think it begs the question - if we were to be able to foster and facilitate a system that works reliably to establish lending channels for through cryptocurrency, would the government then step in as it now cuts into the earnings on their own interest rates (if of course those crypto-lending substitutes are superior in value and garner a sizeable [read: majority] interest in such  options for lending)?  Would Cryptocurrency then be outlawed outright or will there only be certain aspects that are outlawed (think ICOs).",
