            "Text": "has it dawned on many of you that the strategies we are seeing are designed to make people give up? sells offs shake out one group of people. now we have a low volatility environment that will shake out the traders\n\nmeanwhile you can mine or buy and accumulate without trouble.\n\nseriously. exchanges are investing untold millions in expanding. network hashpower is WAY up probably due to next gen asics being used in secret.\n\nthe price run is an exit strategy and happens when the larger players have had time to build up a nice stack buying the dead markets and mining. a good uptrend is established and another year long run begins to draw in the masses which provide the money flowing in to further support the price run and then you sell into that strength. it may be a year or two or three. don't stress over it. accumulate and wait.\n\nthis market just destroys ADHD mindsets\n\nbefore 2021 you're going to hear about SEC regulations and they will most likely be favorable in the long term. more money will flow in. a bitcoin etf could bring countless billions. if the LN is perfected by then you have the scenario for 100k or more and even at 100k it would be the SMALLEST percentage gain between peaks we have ever seen. 2013 was 1k and 2017 was 20 fold, even 10 fold from 2017 would be 200k a coin. add in the halving and you have a very long term bull case for those who can be patient and just not stress over it...this probably eliminates 90\\+&#37; of people just like it did 2009\\-2017",
