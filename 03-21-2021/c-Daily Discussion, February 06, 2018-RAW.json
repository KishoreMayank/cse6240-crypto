Giancarlo especially seems cognizant, well researched and moderate. Generally the sentiment seems to be slowly transitioning from the initial 'push it away' heard from hearings years ago over from 'wait and see' to 'ok- it's not going away, let's wrap our heads around this and reign in in so nobody is getting ripped off or doing anything too wild'. Markets worlwide are getting a long overdue correction after quantative exuberance went mad- we've got huge excess US deficit potentially coming up. BTC is not going anywhere.\n\nI wouldn't be suprised to see a flight to this new asset class in 2018 should the debt exceed 1trln, (hint: it will) despite the herd mentality and recent domino sell offs.  it is nothing but a blip in the ocean for this disruptive, paradigm shifting tech in the coming years. Bitcoin is the birth of a black swan event and we ain't seen nothing yet. \n\nLike it or not regulatory framework will bring clarity, reduce risk and encourage institutional players who tend to be, at the least more measured and with a longer term purbiew. dust is settling from this global correction. Fundamentals are strong, good things on the horizon- a constant evolution. People are thinking in short term. Nervousness has lost some market participants who got in for the wrong reasons- some cut losses and left ahead, some will stick by the sidelines others just did no research and have been shook out rightfully (for now). I'm positive long term absolutely, and more so now than in a while.",

Too much greed, not enough informed \"investors\", because that is what it became: an investment. Whether it is rocketing up or crashing down this is a bad thing for something supposedly to be a currency. It's not been true growth, it's been careless speculation and the very definition of a bubble. It's happened before and will happen again no doubt.\n\nI got out before the end of last year as i was unhappy with the velocity of price movement and didn't find it sustainable, fees were becoming utter nonsense and the very concept of the coin was lost.\n\nWhat happened to bitcoin helping bankless Africans etc? You think they would pay those fucking fees? It just became a commodity of no practical use and until the price goes back to where I think it should be or bitcoin again becomes on track to be actually USEFUL I will carry on as a spectator.\n\nIf we don't see 5.6k or less in the next few days I'll be quite surprised.",

Does anyone have any information on a safe way to do this using a Ledger Nano S where I could theoretically lock myself out of having access to my Bitcoins for the next 2 years?\n\nAt that point I feel like there would be little to no stress because worrying about it would accomplish nothing and I've locked myself in for the long term hold and no chance of panic selling.",

But I am hedging that the accumulated capitulations over the last week are the indicators of an overall capitulation. The crypto community is extremely universal and diverse. Not like a bad quarterly report or corporate scandal can bring it down. Keep in mind, the whales can eat a lot of passive little fish, but a lot of aggressive little fish can eat the whale.",

People should take advantage of it.  \n\nSomewhere down the line, there's going to be another asset bubble that gets bid up to impossible highs.  It's going to have an evangelist class that spin tail after tail about how the valuations are not only completely justifiable, but actually quite low.  It's going to have a class of folks who got in early enough to make sums of money that defy belief in short order.  It's going to be opaque enough that almost anything is justifiable.  It's going to generate tremendous regret amongst those who didn't get in early.  It's going to create a sense of momentum that seems unstoppable.  It's going to create a mythology that distinguishes it from all previous bubbles.  It's going to generate a huge sense that the world will be divided between those who saw the light and got in, and all the suckers who couldn't understand it and missed out.  Eventually, it's going to attract people who's only interest or understanding in the asset is the ability to ride it up to the moon.  And you'll see people defer debt, and max out credit cards, cash in savings, transfer assets, even mortgage their very homes to get in.  And your Aunt Edna will call and ask what you know about it.  And that's when you know that the whole thing is going to come crashing down.  \n\nBut you won't be part of that, because you learned a valuable lesson in the bitcoin bubble burst of 2017/2018.  ",

Instead of seeing these sharp bounces followed by slow dragging drops to a lower low, we are now seeing a slow steady climb with a quick dip to a slightly higher low. The bulls are returning.",

There is certainly pain in the community and there are more than a fair share of people that entered the world of crypto at \u2013 only in retrospect \u2013 what we now see was ill timed. And it is very clear that there are ample opinions on what everyone should be doing. But again I cannot stress that it has been exactly one, single month. Sell, hodl, dollar cost average. Choices made by individuals are choices made from free will. At the very least, what everyone will agree upon is that volatility is pre-backed into these sorts of trades. It is the same in every market, albeit perhaps not to the same degree. Just look at the stock market today and you\u2019ll see that the VIX hit 50 and a level not seen since 2015.\n\nFor those that are able, my opinion would be to be patient and wait until the dust settles. Give current market oscillation time to moderate. Give it all just another, single month.",

            "Text": "When I first got into Bitcoin, the price had just crashed from its all-time highs during the Mt Gox fiasco. I'd been watching Bitcoin for a while, considering it. The spike to >1k USD was a sign to me that this thing had real value and had been battle-tested. \n\nSo as soon as it crashed, I knew I had to be ready. \n\nWhen I bought in, my cash-out goal was $10k. I thought it was reasonable that Bitcoin could be worth 10k one day, possibly as much as 50k. That was the trade I wanted to make. I didn't have a timeframe in mind - years, a decade potentially. \n\nNow, 10k isn't a vague hope. I consider Dec/Jan a trial-run for just how big this thing could be. Basically the idea that it can reach those heights has now been proven. \n\nA recovery from 5 to 10 is easy, compared from the run from $100 to $1000 or $1000 to $10000. Might be months, maybe a year or two.\n\nStill Hodlin'. ",

That index shows a muted, dampened view to what happened to many individual technology stocks back then.  Many stocks , mostly dot coms,  but other real quality Internet technology stocks,  fell 90% or more off their ATHs when the bubble burst.

It's about as accurate as throwing darts at a board at least in most cases. Sure, there are some scenarios where patterns are detected, but with the crypto space predictability is very rare. I've seen so many TAs on YouTube and everywhere else, and most times they just couldn't be more wrong. Occasionally they get it right, but I suppose if there are 100 TA's per minute on youtube, there's gonna be a few lucky hits. Anyway ...screw TA's for crypto and anyone thinks they are worth a damn, by all means, use them as your beacon. Not me.",

It's not like people are buying Bitcoin so they can use LN. They are using LN so they can use their Bitcoin.\n\n2. Any other crypto can just adopt LN, if it really does add value (which seems a bit doubtful) thereby taking any LN \"advantage\" away from BTC...if there does turn out to be one at all.\n\nSo I ask why wouldn't LN just drive down the price of any properly-working crypto, relative to where it would otherwise be according to Gresham's Law?\n\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law",

            "Text": "Are people not seeing that this is all a massively blatant crypto manipulation pump (mid nov - mid dec) and dump (mid dec - mid feb) being done by institutional money? The created dip isn't over just yet (~10 more days) while the big money is buying all the way down to load up as much as they can during the dip they are creating (Mid Dec - Mid Feb, coordinated dumps + FUD) using the money they got from pumping the market and selling at the top just a few weeks prior (Mid Nov - Mid Dec, coordinated pump + lack of FUD)...\n\nLong story short this created downtrend is likely to turn around like clockwork in mid Feb (~Feb 14) and the same manipulators will ride the wave again back up, with a much larger position they then had in the past, with no additional capitol cost to them... Think chess, not checkers!\n\nIMO...\nMid Feb = ~4.6k low\nLate Feb = ~13k high\nLate March = ~20k high\nLate April = ~28k high\nLate May = ~35k high\nLate June = ~40k high\ufeff",

            "Text": "Question for the Bitcoin Community - As part of my college course I am currently enrolled in a module much of which is centered around the history of bitcoin . I am completely new to the world Bitcoin and still finding my feat in terms of understanding everything so please go easy on my below post in terms of things that may be wrong or dont fit with your views on bitcoin . As part of the course we are currently looking at the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash - if you've a few minutes read the below and let me know whats right and wrong and what else I need to know about the split in the community in terms of parties working in both communities , issues and solutions to both parties ideas. \n\nI appreciate any feedback you could give. \n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\nAugust 2017 we saw the creation of a hard fork from Bitcoin\u2019s original blockchain ledger. The fork was created as a result of a debate that caused a split into the bitcoin community. The debate was centered around the issue of scalability in the bitcoin blockchain . The following outlines below what I believe to be the arguments presented by both users of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash on how best to solve the scalability issue . Open to any corrections of details people may have on either sides arguments . \n\nThe Issue of Scalability.\n\nUnder satoshis original whitepaper for Bitcoin we know that individual\u2019s transactions are grouped together to form blocks. Each block has its own blockhash made up of four key components \n1)\tThe Hash of the previous block \n2)\tA time stamp of the new block \n3)\tThe merkle tree root hash which is the method by which transaction are bundled together from the transaction slush pool  with the first transaction hash in the bunch being the coinbase of that bundle . \n4)\tNonce \u2013 This is the puzzle minors need to solve in order to complete the block . To solve the puzzle requires brut computing force so minors must expend computer processing power to find the value randomly that satisfies the puzzle. Upon finding the value the blocks hash is then complete and at this point the block is added to the blockchain .\n\nWhen a block is added to the blockchain a miner ie the person whos cpu solved the nonce to create the block is rewarded in two ways \u2013 1stly with the issue of newly minted bitcoin  and 2ndly with all the transaction fees that people wishing to send bitcoin transactions to attach to their transactions . \n\nThe issue with scalability surrounding the blockchain prior to August 2017 was that each block could had a maximum blocksize of 1MB which allowed for roughly 250,000 transaction per day to be processed . The issue was that as more and more people began to use the Bitcoin network it began to run slower as users who were unwilling to pay higher fees had to wait longer for their transactions to be added from the slush to a block and confirmed . How to solve this issue of scalability in the blockchain is what ultimately lead to the forking of the blockchain in August 2017 and the creation of Bitcoin Cash .\n\nBitcoins solution to scalability \u2013 \nBitcoins solution to its scalability issue include the creation of both Segregated Witness ( Segwit ) and lightning protocols. Segwit was introduced to increase the blockchain blocksize from 1mb to a maximum of 4mb with the current protocol allowing for blocks to be 2mbs in size . Segwit also allowed for the creation of layered networks on the bitcoin protocol that will ultimately lead into the adoption of the lightning network . \n\nThe lightening network is a way in which payments can be chained together outside of the blockchain. It works by allowing participants to transactions interact only twice with the blockchain ledger , once to open and once to close a set of transaction . In-between the opening and closing participants enforce digital IOUs against one another with either party having the option to end the current transaction string of IOUs and cash out for the balancing amount . \n\nBitcoin Cash\u2019s Solution to scalability . \nBitcoin Cash creators changed bitcoins protocol such that the block size was increased from 1Mb to 8MB thus allowing for more transactions to be confirmed in each block helping the network to run quicker . \n\nIf you owned Bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017 you also own Bitcoin Cash ( I Think) . Because the chains forked I think so do the public and private key address in the underlying system which means if you sign into a wallet that supports bitcoin cash you\u2019ll find some which at the time I wrote this was roughly 952 USD per coin . Is this correct? \n\nThanks for all your feedback.\n\n\n",

After scanning various resources, including the original paper by Satoshi, and additional commentaries on his C++ *(I am not a programmer)* I was wondering if someone could explain to me, hopefully in layman's terms, if^why I am wrong in thinking that eventual value of^(*the sum total of circulating*) BTC will equate with the ongoing cost^(*presumably electricity and maintaining related mining infrastructure*) of maintaining the ledger. I'm sorry, I just don't see where the value-added is coming from here. \n\nPlease understand I am not being aggressive, it's just a sticking point in my mind I am hoping someone can help me with :) Thank you <3",

I'm looking at a couple of different exchanges that are open, and the prices are not lined up.  For example, I see one exchange at $7020 and another at $7201.\n\n2) Sometimes the bid-ask spreads are ENORMOUS.  For example, on Coinfloor, the current bid-ask is $6125-$7230.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that the market seems extraordinarily inefficient.  What is driving that?  Just thin volume?",

Since the ATH when trading volume is low the price is trending downwards or takes a dive straight down, only then the trading volume picks up and price goes up a bit for a few hours/days. Then when the craze subsides and volume goes down the downtrend continues. So where's the bottom? My guess is 4k in 2 or 3 months. But still, cost averaging into this to build a position.

            "Text": "To expound on my other comment, people with capital buy an asset once it bottoms out. If you noticed, there hasn't been much buying over the last 2 days. Someone will throw in a couple million to stimulate things and other big dogs will follow suit. Once they shoot the price up a good 20% then they will sell. The reason is that they know there will be a seller on the other end trying to recoupe their losses. The seller bought at $10k and was very depressed and considered selling the first time the price hit $7k. The price dropped to $6k and they got even more upset. Now that the price is at $7k again the seller will rush to sell and the big dogs and clever traders will have taken their profits. \n\nExpect the price to go back down to $6k then below after this.",

Ver and Wu made their play, and overplayed their cards. The market is punishing them for their insolence as we speak (BCH is considerably down relative to Bitcoin, in every single meaningful metric there is).\n\nThey have a strong foothold in the mining space, a strong foothold in various Bitcoin-related namespaces, a vast war chest of funds that they are only gradually working through, fingers in lots of Bitcoin-related companies' pies, and an absolutely jawdropping lack of moral integrity. These assets have been irritating to suffer the effects of, but at this point it is clear that they are losing serious sums of money via opportunity cost, and the market doesn't actually consider them to be a serious contender for the Bitcoin brand whatsoever, so they've been losing social capital hand over fist (Ver especially), which will be almost impossible to recoup. So, once again, most of what they've managed to do is just *strengthen* Bitcoin, ironically enough, by giving it a chance to immunize itself against this type of attack. They're almost like a vaccine.",

Solid volume push to a certain level (7k), followed by low volume plateau (between 7k to 8k) - this is the bull trap period happening now before another crash.  \n\nThe last time this happened was when it was pushed to 10k, hovered for 2 weeks between 10k-12k (bull trap period), then followed by crash to 6k.\n\nEdit:  I do not think this is natural.  It is too systematic and looks manipulated.  If I have to guess, this looks more and more like whales cashing out in a coordinated manner.",

It will keep dropping\n\nWait till you see either a big prolonged rise (eg. $1000+ sustained over the course of 2 weeks or even a month)\n\nWait till you see a flatline longer than 1-2 months\n\nOr wait until you see a massive $2000-3000 spike in the span of an hour. \n\nAnything else is just a trap.",

Its not nothing though, and can be thought of as irregular dividends.  This is another reason why you should control your own private keys for your coins, because if you have your stack on an exchange, then it will take much, much longer to get your forked coins (if at all), and the price will plummet when lots of people try to sell them at once.  \n\nThe Bcash forked coin could be sold for upwards of 20% of a Bitcoin at times.

This was the result of customer feedback that the time between purchasing and receiving digital currency was too long.\n\nIn order to enable instant buys:\n\n1. Visit your accounts page on Coinbase\n2. Remove the following bank as a payment method:  [name of my bank]\n3. Re-link it by selecting your bank and logging in via the secure prompt\n\nLinking a bank only takes a couple minutes. If successful, your purchases will have an instant delivery time. \nIn some rare cases, your bank\u2019s security settings may prevent us from offering instant buys. If this happens, you will notice your orders delivered at non-instant delivery dates. If you run into any trouble, you can learn more about connecting a bank account on our support page.\n\nThank you for being a customer.\n\nRegards,\nThe Coinbase Team\"",

It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Looking at a chart of BTC from the start (zooming out), there were these \"ravines\" after many of the dips in 2013, 2014 and 2015. And after the \"ravine\", it looks like the price kind of stabilized. A possible explanation is that the steep price rise today is caused by the BTC market running out of \"panic sellers\", thus signaling that the slump is grinding to a halt and the price is stabilizing. But how much is due to the Senate hearing, and other news? Who knows? Would be nice to see a turning point now.",

If a bitcoin ETF is offered to institutional investors then it offers them an opportunity to easily invest long term in Bitcoin and the provider of the ETF would buy up and hold the underlying Bitcoins on their behalf. \n\nThat is not true with futures markets where you can take either side of a trade without ever touching the underlying asset. \n\nWhat I suspect is going to happen is they are going to continue to drag their feet on an ETF until the futures volume is so high that the banks are able to manipulate the price of bitcoin to their liking and only then will an ETF be approved ",

Fees and delays are ok for a store of value, but instability is not. Bitcoin is about as unstable as it gets and it will probably remain that way for a few years at least. \n\nPeople investing today are speculating that bitcoin will *become* a stable store of value or a usable currency. Today it is not useful for either. ",

I have done quite well with Bitcoin and investing in general.\n\nWhile I am glad to hear it sounds like you are a model investor and have self control in all aspects of your life, I came here to learn about a feature coded into Bitcoin that allows you to \"time lock\" your coins that I heard about yesterday. Given the volatility of Bitcoin lately combined with my desire to hold my remaining coins long term anyways, this sounded like an interesting feature I hoped to learn some more about.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you have any relevant information to add, so I can't imagine why someone like yourself would jump into a comment thread.",

They won't let you withdraw fiat or coin from their exchange until your deposit clears, which is fair. Also, the limit has forced me to DCA and as a result, I have a much lower buy-in level than my initial buy-in in the 11s.\n\nCoinbase is a cluster fuck. That's just my experience. Most people have no problems. Cash App looks wicked easy, but I have never used it. Bitflyer confirmed me in less than a day, but I haven't used them yet for a buy. Bitstamp had a long confirm time of over a month.\n\n",

I never stated the opposite.\nWhat I've written (below) is that \"In the long term Bitcoin has a pretty good chance of being highly demanded as a store of value, alternative asset or even as a currency\". That's it. It's an experiment in the way to consolidation.\nThe exception would be situations when  alternatives are even more volatile and risky (highly devalued fiat currencies), or in cases where there is no access to banking services.

We are just putting a taskforce together to study the risks and rewards with Bitcoin.\"\n\nThis interview sounds a lot more promising then was originally anticipated from all the bears in the BTC market. Since Sen Shelby has the jurisdiction to guide regulation his comments seem like it could be interpreted as good news for Bitcoin/crypto in my opinion.",
