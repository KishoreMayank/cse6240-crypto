            "Text": "**GoTenna Launches a Bitcoin Wallet That Works Without the Internet**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/gotenna-bitcoin-wallet-mesh-network/\n\nIf James Bond needed to use bitcoin on a secret mission in the jungle, he probably couldn't drop by a Starbucks to use the wifi.\n\nSince internet connections aren't always available, reliable or private, cryptocurrency users need alternative ways to connect to the network. So the New York-based startup goTenna, founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.\n\nAnnounced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app's settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.\n\n\"You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas,\" goTenna engineer Richard Meyers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings' recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. \"As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating.\"\n\nThe signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.\n\nIf the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.\n\n\"It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant,\" Meyers said, adding:\n\n\"It's going to obscure who you are and where you're at when making these transactions. So that's a big privacy advantage there.\"\n\nThis system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn't the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks.\n\nIt takes a village\nStepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.\n\nLast year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.\n\nThen, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed \"net neutrality,\" fans of ethereum, the world's second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.\n\nWhen net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It's an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.\n\nIndeed, it was Samourai Wallet's open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna's team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.\n\nAs Meyers explained:\n\n\"It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through.\"",

            "Text": "**Bitcoin Price Eyes Breakout As Trading Range Tightens**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-eyes-breakout-as-trading-range-tightens/\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest.\n\nWith the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837.\n\nThe sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.\n\nThe rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.\n\nView\n\nAnother rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.\n\nThat said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).\n\nOn the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.",

The dollar may never completely die but will lose relevancy in global finance.\n\nThe whales only have a finite amount to sell off, and in the case of global adoption, why would they want to sell all? If bitcoin reaches global adoption you will be able to use it to purchase goods and services anywhere. If its globally mass adopted people will readily accept it as people accept cash today. Even if whales sold everything they would eventually run out and the price would have to adjust . It would take a concerted and costly effort to keep the price down in face of overwhelming demand. That isn't to say that mass adoption is guaranteed,  but if it happens it is hard to imagine bitcoins not being worth millions each. ",

Instant transfer to fiat and payment processing I haven't heard of something that does this but i'm sure there is although I don't like it. What's the point in accepting bitcoin if you'll just sell it straight away. People want to buy with it to get it circulating. I mean the fluctuations can cut both ways. Accepting BTC is going to add work to accountancy regardless. worth the aggro ",
