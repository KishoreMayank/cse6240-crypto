If it stays at around $20 longterm, even better.",

It will come AFTER an economic crisis or the coming recession, which will force governments and govermental organizations to be more effective. They way they will do that is blockchain. Blockchain will be actively promoted by governments. They have no choice. The question is: how will the price of btc augment because of the new blockchain society? That is the big question, nobody knows. But chances are btc will become more popular, just for the fact societies and businesses will transform into blockchain societies and businesses. I do not believe in hype-bullruns though. Next bullrun is based on adoption and implementation, not on crazyness and speculative value. ",

What if everyone, is gambling only what they are willing to lose, playing this game of musical chairs with a cryptoasset that increases in value because of the hodler of  last resort?\n\nI know I put like 5, 10% of my paycheck into limit orders below the price, how many others like me are there? probably more than dozens. \n\nThis 6k range is awesome. If 4k could come, and even 3k.. wow.. But nobody shorts bitcoin long term. The musical chair game is to find the hodler of last resort. ",

Everyone else - the fanboys and tech savy people - already invested in btc. Nobody knows what bakkt is except the ones that follow daily btc news. You think average joe is going to invest in Btc because of bakkt? He doesn't even know what it is. Only way to increase btc price is heavy adoption, which is not what's happening right now. Banks and businesses cut out their btc payment methods, so adoption level dropped. The thing that could save btc is blockchain adoption by governments and organizations, which will take a couple of years. You can invest now, wait 5 years and you'd maybe have doubled your investment when btc is at 12000, which would be a fantastic achievement.",

            "Text": "As I said, why would anyone have invested in cars in those first few decades when horses could go anywhere, and move faster without requiring gasoline? But that was the time to invest, not when it's even more obvious. Few people could envision the road systems (infrastructure) that could be built, and the speed cars would eventually  reach on these roads. \n\nWithout vision there is only denial of potential. Are you really basing the success of Bitcoin and crypto on current state? Even though it's come this far in 10 years already? You believe the progress is just going to stop? That these early ATMs represent how it's all going to look in another 10 years?",

            "Text": "Nope. They were dismissed as stupid hundreds of times first. A small few who believed in them jumped on board, a few small road systems were developed, used by a very niche group of people. The speed limit was forced down to 20 mph so they wouldn't spook the horses lol.\n\nThese things take time, and the companies with stakes of billions in the bet that crypto will suceed would very much disagree with you.  \n\nBesides, high risk investment and store of value would likely overshadow currency use first. High risk investment is integrated with speculation all the time, nothing wrong with that. In short term BTC may hit 50k or it may drop to 5k, who cares? We all know this space is growing and personally I'd rather be in invested for when it sticks.",
