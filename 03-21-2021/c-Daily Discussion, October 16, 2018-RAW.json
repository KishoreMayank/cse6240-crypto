Queue price dump \"b/c meme triangle was denied.\" \n\nCBOE futures close low as hell, around $6,100, $6,200 or so. (Look what happened on the last CBOE expiration) \n\nPeople panic sell their FALLING Bitcoin back into tether thus inflating Tether's price back to normal or higher than before. (Or other stablecoins) \n\nWe go slowly sideways but down for the next 2 days after CBOE, queue all the bears posting we break $6k. \n\nOn Friday October 19th, 2018, the golden bullrun we've all been waiting for starts. \n\nAfter 1 fake down, 1 fake up, 1 fake down, whales manage to acquire a SHITLOAD of pumped stablecoins (Especially tether because rumor has it deposits are being reopened on Finex in the next few days.) \n\nFriday, October 19th, 2018: \n\nCOBINHOOD offers zero trading fees margin trading with 3x leverage for the following pairs: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, COB/ETH. \n\nGet ready to get your longs in for BTC around $5,900 or $6k or so. \n\nHerding techniques, guys ;) ",

            "Text": "The justified price of bitcoin at any given point of time is a function of its distribution. If distribution is concentrated, price will tend to tank and oscillate until distribution comes to a state where most of the bitcoin ends up with hands capable of hodling. Then price goes up and keeps going up until again HODLing capacity of the holders wanes due to sitting on large profits. Then the cycle of decline and oscillations starts again until a new stable state of HODLing is reached. This is the single most important factor that has driven most of the bitcoin peaks and valleys. \n\nNot very easy to figure out what the distribution is like at any given point. You can get blockchain address balance distribution stats but those are not the full story either as addresses do not equal holders and also do not reveal the holding capacity of the holder.",

            "Text": "True but what I tried to explain is the factor that essentially drives the demand and supply of bitcoin at any given moment. \n\nFor example, why is it that bitcoin appears stable at $6k today when it remained stable at $200 for so long in 2015? It is because in 2015, a lot of people owned 100s of bitcoins and some 1000s. Now very few do. That is why the price today can sustain at 6k while being totally non-sustainable in 2015.\n\nPrice will start climbing again only when most existing hodlers end up selling such that few even own more than even 1 or 2 btc. This shakeout is what is achieved by these big bear markets. And this is also why bear markets don't end quickly. It takes a while of decline and stable bottom for a new steady state of sustainable distribution to form.\n\nNow with this knowledge of the mechanism of the market, you might think you can stay ahead by holding on and sure we can try that. But in a game of who blinks first, someone always looses. So the game is really who gets tired of hodling. The ones who hold on will eventually see gains when the recovery occurs due to others having sold and made the distribution better.",

For hashrate to increase a miner orders hardware, someone needs to build the hardware, then the miner needs to set up data centers and negotiate electricity prices etc. This cycle is probably 6+ months.\n\nThey are speculating that if they spend $x now they will get eg $1.5x later.\n\nWhen you are looking at hashrate increasing now, you are looking at the culmination of bets made 6+ months ago. A bet from some miners a while ago that the price will go up.\n\nLikely those bets are NOT paying off right now as the price is lower than the energy costs in many places.\n\nSo hashrate doesn\u2019t push the price up.

And worse, every day that goes past I am paying interest on the loan I took to buy hardware. So every day that I don't sell, I'm risking that the price goes down and my situation worsens, or that the price stays flat and I'm losing money on interest or electricity.\n\nThat means that when the price increases even slightly, I am heavily incentivised to sell. This is similar to the prisoners dilemma - I should withhold my bitcoins from the market to drive the price up, this is good for all miners. However, I have costs to cover, so I should dump my mined coins into the market before another miner does. This may be an explanation for the sudden drops we see whenever the price inches up.\n\nSo while you might be right if miners acted as a single entity and miners could afford to hold indefinitely, this is not the case.",
