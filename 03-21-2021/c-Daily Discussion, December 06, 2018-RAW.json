If you have a predictable enough emotional response, then maybe some state could code up a whale bot to try and suppress the price. The problem there is the demand is increasing, the state could only push so much back into their own hands, which would fuck up the market killing feedback loop that they'd be trying to create. I guess that's probably the best option at this point for states trying to attack the network.

Wild theory: [Bithumb BTC/KRW](https://imgur.com/a/Z0ghIPL)       \nIt seems it was being propped up artificially since August 23. Around November 11, the wash trading stopped and so Bitcoin went down to its real price. In other words, it shouldn't have gone sideways in the beginning of September, instead it should have kept going gradually down.  You can see that the volume stops all of a sudden November 11, one day before the big drop in price.     \nHow could a exchange in Korea prop up the price? Wash trading. Bithumb, during that period, had the highest BTC volume (higher than Binance), while having low number of active users. [source](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2018/12/bithumb-became-the-largest-cryptocurrency-exchange-through-incentivized-trading/).   \n\nI'm probably way off because I'm a total newbie.

Sell!!!\n\nI never liked cryptocurrencies.  I have my reasons, and I won't divulge them here because that's my edge in the markets - the ability to see problems that no one else does.  Blockchain has its uses, but not in crypto money.  There are some fundamental issues that have to be worked out first.\n\nHowever, I will say that the massive run-up to $20k was based on fraudulent buying that the SEC is currently looking into.  It was all fake, designed to pull in suckers, and you fell for it by letting your greed/ego/FOMO take over.  Another run up will have to be contrived by another scam, and that's not going to happen.

Which is why there are volatile swings. \n\nBitcoin might take a long time to recover but it's wild to think it will never reach the same hype. The people that got rich and sold will be back to do it again. The people that got poor will come back to do it again cause they love misery and a majority of crypto investors are gambling addicts. Thank god for the hodlers and the ones that use bitcoin for transactions, and the ones that teach about the tech, and the team that improves the tech. Without them btc would have died a long time ago. But now it is too late. It will never be killed.",

No matter what the value differential is overseas, my employer still pays me in USD and I forward that money onto my landlord who forwards it on to the banks. That's not going to change. Ever. \n\nOutside the USA, the money can certainly get weaker/stronger against foreign markets. If the US Dollar tanks, all those countries who purchased our debt (China) will also tank too. All level 1 economies have some US Debt and will also be affected. Global economies will all suffer, which is why I am not immediately worried. Long term, sure, it could very well happen. If it did the USA would print money, or get bailed out by George Sauros and Warren Buffet. ",

            "Text": "Thats one of the narratives people tell others. Just some nonsensical crap to get people to buy. Like you are destroying the economy built for the rich and ushering in a new age where crypto cannot be printed by the government and people can never take your money which is on an immutable blockchain.\n\nExcept 2% of wallets own 98% of all coins. So essentially you are actually supporting an ecosystem thats even more oppressive and has even more inequality than real money. Most of these \"whales\" didn't climb to the top with their competence like people such as Bill Gates who made something with real utility. Instead crypto whales just bought in early. If these people were to have power, then you are in trouble.",

The way fundamentals look there's going to be a positive media release cycle in the second half of 2019. What you should be looking for for the next 6 months is a support level to hold. Ideally we will wick down to a lower price and immediately shoot back up within a week or two. Then we hold a trading range where buyers step in if we start moving down. That gives you a floor and the final step of the bottoming process. Mid 2019 also puts us only a year out from halving. Currently we are 82% off the high. 2015 was 87% and 411 days if i remember right. We are quickly approaching day 365 of this cycle. Hard to see how we will get to a low with a 1 in front of it. 2500 to 3200 is the zone I keep eyeing ",

I'll sell when it's high buy when it's low. We can post in here but need to ignore all this noise when buying, because you don't buy when people are taking out loans to buy btc at 20k, smart money buys it low.",

You are not the first one to say its over and when it comes to scaling these other coins are no albert einsteins its just about trade offs and what you want to sacrifice for speed. ",
