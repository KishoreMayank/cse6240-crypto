Is it possible that we have reached a point where all the weak hands have been shaken out and only hodlers, bears, and people timing the market are left? Hodlers greatly outnumber everyone else hence the insanely low volume maybe? Thus this creates a situation where a single whale can pump the market and then dump once others pile on some time later for profit? I think this would explain all the \"Barts.\" \n\nThe people that FOMOed last year aren't going to come back unless they see/hear that Bitcoin is hitting all time highs again. This is where the institutional money comes in. They need to be buying this shit up to put the price in a good place to get people to want to buy up that normally wouldn't be in this. Whales need to think more long term and not keep fucking us and themselves long term.",

It will take time but it's a given that Blockchain and DLT are here to stay and progressing at a very rapid rate. Most of us are putting in money and just waiting to get rich. Can't be mad that it's taking a little too long lol. I actually feel like this is just a period of big money taking time and strategizing how they will use the crypto space. Wall street guys and large corporations don't just their money around. They are planning and strategizing. Too many big names coming in for crypto to fail. Not sure which coins will be the winners in the long run but we are past the days of 100 percent faith in the dollar and big banks. Strong hands will look back and be grateful they held on. And what has been happening lately is much more realistic and sustainable than December 2017. I want my gains to stay not come and go. So hopefully this is just big money waiting to pick where they want to invest and making smart decisions. I could do without the fomo pump and dumps anyway. I'll bet the gains come after consensus when everyone has heard most of the different pitches and find good entry points for coins they like.",

I believe longer term with markets moving towards accepting institutional money and custody available, we will see a huge inflow of money. There has been very little volume lately, seems like people are sitting on the sidelines and just waiting. I think the mindset of original adopters is to just HODL and people like myself who are later adopters who believe in the underlying value of crypto will also HODL. This is what will create a floor in the price. It's a matter of time before price moves higher and when it does I think it will be as aggressive as the move in DEC 2017.",

Noobs who think they can become professional traders by just watching some YouTube videos... The trading world is immensely complex and there are traders who are pure genius people, with PhDs in statistics and financial trading. \n\n> Also, the deflationary nature of the coins would encourage HODLING\n\nNot really. That is a fallacy. Professional traders can still profit by doing what they do, which is trading. Professional traders have no intention to hold on for their dear life, because their main concern is risk-management and portfolio valorization. \n\nHODLING in the long term is for the casual investor, which does not want to be concern about the mundane issues of portfolio management. \n\n>  this will eventually lead to extreme scarcity once weak hands and gamblers are shaken out by the manipulation of whales\n\nAlso, not true. You assume that with scarcity, everyone will want to immediately jump-in. But such thinking only applies if there's actually a need to buy Bitcoins. For example, retailers are already adopting other cryptos, such as Ethereum and Litecoin. So that scarcity which you are referring to, doesn't actually applies unless there's a real demand to use Bitcoins, which currently there's not. \n\nWhen the price goes up exponentially, the amount of money which is required enter the market, in order to maintain the pace is also exponential. This increases uncertainty and fear of another crash.\nAlso, when the price goes up, it becomes more and more difficult to get a profit, equally large to the profit which early-adopters got, the 1000% ratio profit. This is a hype-killer.\n\nThat is why when someone brings those 2013 charts and states \"Bitcoin will recover like it did before, when going from $100 to $1K... I honestly don't believe it\". This kind of behaviour only happens once. If it gets repetitive, professionals get on board and suck the value out.\n\nSo no, whalers will always make money, even if the market is crashing.\n\nBulls make money,\n\nBears make money,\n\nPigs get slaughtered.\n\n>  And then HODLERS dine on the Moon...\n\nYou don't know that. They can also dine in Hell... \n\n\n**EDIT**: Oh! There's also one thing called USDT and unregulated markets, which may well be manipulating everything from the start. Those *\"whalers\"*could simply be traders connected to these exchanges, with access to inside-information. **The house always wins**.",
