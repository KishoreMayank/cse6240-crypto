Nobody's going to use something that risks losing its value in 1 day. It turned into an online casino now and nobody really knows what the hell they're investing in and if all these cryptos really have value. All cryptos had more than one year to prove value, but nothing is happening, nobody is adopting them. Most companies start to be useful after a couple of months. More than 10 years of crypto has brought nothing but gambling, manipulation, speculation and casino.",

I am just proceeding with my daily DCA strategy where I have recently increased my daily fiat amount. I guess there is no point doing any more guessing or taking unnecessary risks. The reason I am a cool cucumber is because I always followed the rule 'Only invest what you can afford to lose'. I would remind that to anyone who is thinking of plunging in at these prices. ",

            "Text": "My two cents. \n\nBitcoin has no underlying value and so its value is 100% based on sentiment and bid/ask market dynamics. Large buy/sell orders move the price and as there is no underlying value the price has no reason to return to a fundamental value and so the price sticks.  \n\nAs it is based on sentiment then it is all behavioural economics that drives this price and as it is only the large orders that move the market then it is only the behaviour of those large orders that counts. They consist of people who lots of bitcoin early, miners and manipulators. He first two I think understand that these current prices may never be seen again. As the value is still fairly significant (not low enough to just say bugger it I\u2019ll hold) they are making their way for the exits while they can still get a big enough layout to have a good life. This leads to big sell orders. He manipulators excentuate this and make money by following and compounding the downward trend. \n\nAs there is no underlying value I think the floor will be the point where that behaviour changes. Where the price is so low the big whales and miners basically have nothing to lose by holding and hoping for a rebound. At this point buyers may fill in hoping for a similar run up as we had in 2017. If I had to take an absolute stab in the dark I would say $1,000 might be in that region, about 5% of the ATH. At that point a portfolio that was once worth $18m would be worth $1m and the holder has not much to gain by selling but may hope for better times ahead. I also think this is a physiological floor that may attract buyers. This may stop the free fall. \n\nAll just my opinion and applying a bit of economic logic to a market driven purely by behaviour. Let me know your thoughts. ",

            "Text": "Posting this again as it is now more pertinent:\n\nBuying Bitcoin when it is down 80% from ATH is not analogous to buying Enron or Lehman stock on its way down. When stocks are plummeting, you are not getting the same for less. That's because the stock has value only because of the earning potential of the company behind it and a plummeting stock is usually the result of lower earnings, lower future potential of earnings, management incompetence and most importantly bankruptcy risk i.e the risk of the stock ceasing to exist.\n\nWith bitcoin however, the thing you are getting for 0.2x of ATH now is exactly what you were getting at ATH. There is negligible risk of bitcoin ceasing to exist and there is no deterioration in the way bitcoin technologically works.\n\nThis is why the idea that a 80% fall will deter new buyers is flawed. Infact since they are getting same for less, they will be encouraged. I know because I was in the same boat as a new buyer in 2016. I will also add that people who buy in times like this are much more likely to HODL and stay comforted during volatility because they do so after some research about how bitcoin works. During a bull phase, most jump in because hey it is going up. They are the ones who fret and fret when momentum reverses and turn on to be what are called 'weak hands'.\n\nThis transfer from weak hands to strong hands is why bitcoin has historically launched into a mega bull run after previous 80% fall events.",

This is the best time to HODL not sell. If the whales can dump Bitcoin nearly $3000 in 10 days, then they could pump it back up $3000 in 3-4 days. That is the general vibe these days: several days of dumps to be catapulted by a day or two of a massive pump. That\u2019s manipulation.",

            "Text": "What is the prediction of Bitcoin going back to 20k? 5 years?10 years? Gonna be extremely difficult and the only way i see it happening is if banks and other institutional players are going to offer it to their clients as a possible part of their portfolio.  Of course big institutional players like banks and retirement funds are not going to gamble with people's money on a highly volatile market against their will, so the real big money is excluded. So it's going to be private money from clients that want to diversify their portfolio by taking a crypto portfolio. The problem is, banks hate crypto at the moment. Nevertheless, in the long run, I think it's an opportunity for them to earn more money, especially when the milennium generation enters the job market. They will be more open towards new forms of investment than the older generations. So, crypto is an opportunity for banks instead of a danger in the long run, and i think this is how banks must see this. Crypto will not replace banks, banks will adopt it but in a different way people think will happen. People will feel safer if they take a cryptoportfolio that is supervised by banks. They won't need to worry about losing private keys for example, or being hacked, and banks could earn additional fees. I see great opportunities in this way of working, and i think this is how it's going to happen. The question is, how long will it take. I personally think 3 to 5 years before banks change their attitude towards crypto, and this could lead to a new bullrun. At the moment, there is just too much risk and too much manipulation. ",

You\u2019ll place an order for a price below the last traded price, and your order will sit on the book until Coinbase can match you with a seller. The closer your limit price is to the last traded price, the higher the likelihood it will be filled.  \n\nEdit:\nAlso helpful to understand that Coinbase Pro doesn\u2019t charge fees for limit orders because it\u2019s trying to incentivize users to bring more liquidity to the exchange. Market orders on the other hand extract liquidity from the exchange since by placing a market order you\u2019re eating through the sell side of the order book to fill your order, no matter the price. When large enough, those are the sort of orders that can move prices quickly. ",

The net present value of all those forecast future dividends is what it is valued at in today\u2019s dollars. Apple will be owners of shares money every year in those dividends. Bitcoin owners get zero. Hence it\u2019s fundamental value is zero. Only worth something because of a misconception by people that it has value. If they stop believing that then bitcoin will free fall, similar to what we have been seeing for the last year. ",

            "Text": "A business provides goods and services. The operating profit of the company - plus any dividends, which are profits paid to shareholders as cash - provides a good valuation of the stock price. As companies grow the stock price typically also grows to reflect the growing business.\n\nMeanwhile, a Bitcoin is a virtual token that is backed by nothing and is only worth exactly what someone else is willing to pay for it.\n\nThe value of a stock is part of what it is. If Microsoft irrationally went to $0.001 tomorrow and you purchased all of it, you would own a fabulously successful software company and - by doing nothing - soon you would be stinking rich with income from the dividend. They would pay you simply for being a shareholder.\n\nThe entire value of a Bitcoin is external, based on what someone else is willing to pay. If Bitcoin went to $0 and you purchased all of it, you wouldn't have anything. You'd be desperately trying to get other people to buy Bitcoin from you.\n\nThere is no asset protection in Bitcoin, because it has no internal value.\n\nWarren Buffet is famously overquoted, but his stance was that investments must put your money to work. Money sitting in a bank does nothing. Gold sitting in a vault does nothing. Bitcoin sitting on the Blockchain does nothing. But investing money in a business... your money does work for you.",

People are beginning to realize that the value of bitcoin was based on the belief in bitcoin, but believing is not enough to sustain value. If i find a stone and you want to buy it for 3 dollars, and then you convince someone else that it's 4 dollars, this can continue until people ask themselves: what the hell can we do with a stone? At the moment, there are no benefits in btc: transaction costs aren't lower than fiat transfer, it has high volatility, so you can't buy anything with it. So the big question is: what is it's real value? ",

If it goes much lower the miners will pull out as they are losing money and then the entire crypto market will crash down to absolutely nothing. I hate to be all doom-and-gloom, I've been in Bitcoin since 2011 and would like nothing more than it to recover but at this stage it's looking unlikely to say the least. Regardless, unless it goes <$100 per coin then I will still be in profit :P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also been selling large amounts for the past 2 weeks, it was inevitable with Craig Wright and his cronies intentionally crashing the market. Little do they know they will kill their own creation because if Bitcoin dies, every cryptocurrency will die alongside it including their shitty Bcash fork.",

            "Text": "There is no accurate prediction because there is no accurate valuation.\n\nBitcoin is objectively worth $0, because you can't build anything with it (unlike, say, gold) and it is infinitely replicatable (anyone can start their own fork.) It also earns no income (unlike stock in a company.) And if you thought the banks were corrupt: allow me to introduce you to the whales and miners.\n\nPrivate investment won't save Bitcoin. I saw one speculative investment recommendation that said if you were really really interested, restrict crypto to no more than 0.1% of your portfolio to mange risk. Newsflash: that's no more than $1000 if you have a million dollars. Institutional investment isn't going to save Bitcoin, because the risk is just too high to make any commitment.\n\nAlso, how sick is Bitcoin if the community knows it's in trouble and is praying for institutional buyers to turn up so everyone cash out? Nobody wants your Bitcoin, or your used Blockchain.",

It happened last time to bail out the banks (and that is when gold went up, not when the market collapsed), but to say that will happen again is an assumption, to say the least. The biggest fear right now is tarrifs. If tarrifs cause a recession its hard to imagine how printing money would fix that... \n\nFinally, you have no idea if anyone is even going to care about bitcoin by the time the market collapses, for all you know it's value will quadruple, from one dollar to four lol. \n\n\n\n",

Especially when there exist so many businesses and ecosystems within the crypto asset space than can leverage different assets as risk to attempt building their business. I.E. If the price drops below a certain level, institutions like Gemini will open a line of credit and scoop up as much as they can afford.\n\nNow, how low is that price? Hard to say. But your prediction is a max $0.99x17.4mln would be a total BTC cap of 17.22mln. That would be easy credit for a highly risk tolerant company to access if they wanted to buy the whole ecosystem.\n\nJust how I see it",

The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem. Except for post-quantum cryptography, as of 2017, currently used popular public-key encryption and signature schemes (e.g., elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) and RSA) can be broken by quantum adversaries. The advantage of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks that are proven or conjectured to be impossible using only classical (i.e.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

This crash was to be expected, but the fundementals for a new bullrun are bad. Still too much manipulation, not easy to buy, declining public interest etc. Also, in fact one shouldn't talk about bullrun anymore, but adoption. Cryptos need to show their value in society. But you know how it goes, as we know from the .com bubble. Owners take the money, throw parties and post pics on Instagram. Only a few are willing to work hard. I absolutely do not agree with the general opinion here that all altcoins are shitcoins. Some of them fullfill an actual need that cannot be fullfilled by centralized systems. 90 percent of altcoins will die out though. I'm not positive about the current market. I expect at least another 2 years of bearmarket and btc might fall to 1-2k. Very harsh times ahead of us when it comes to cryptoprices. Things need to be weeded out, coins must die, blockchain must be adopted by governments etc. In the end, blockchain will make societies 50x more effective and moneyflow way more effective and efficient. Again, i'm extremely negative about the current market, but in the end, after the next economic crisis, governments and companies will look at new ways to make economies more efficient, and blockchain will be the way to go.

And if this was really a concern, how come Bitcoin dominance % has been on a rise since the mania of Dec 2017 when it became common knowledge that cryptos included Bitcoin and 1500+ other coins? \n\nBitcoin is the most secure cryptoasset with the most network advantage due to the ecosystem of developers and businesses built around it. A fork or new coin has its task cut out to replicate these qualities AND still retain a fair level of decentralisation.\n\nIf a bigger network, more decentralised, more secure appears then yes, Bitcoin could get diluted. But why will that happen? Most Bitcoin forks happen, in the first place, due to egos and hidden objectives of a few so that takes away the possibility of what you are saying or at least makes the possibility very negligible. I am not here to tell you that Bitcoin is a zero risk vehicle but rather telling you my view on some of the supposed risks. I do have some alt coins though BTC is lion's share and M is lion's share of the remaining. The proportion I have in alt coins is based on my assessment of the probability that they may end up with a valuable network. I don't claim it is absolute zero for other coins but at the same time it is not that any new coin or fork start on the same footing as Bitcoin and immediately dilute its value. So calling crypto 'infinitely replicable' is just plain incorrect.",

If the client wants btc or there is potential demand for btc, as a company, you should fullfill their demand. Also, they could offer both, as well as other established cryptos in their portfolio. So the story is not banks versus crypto. Btc has the brand, the universal usage etc. So to say banks could start their own crypto and just dismiss the nr. 1 crypto is not smart if there is demand for it. ",

This crash was caused by two forks a couple of days ago. Some people moved their money from btc into new forks and others just took their money out of btc and converted it into fiat, afraid of losing it. This caused a psychological blow. People losing confidence in btc and not re-investing their money, so the price didn't bounce back. Also, what you see now are miners selling part of their bitcoin in order to survive. ",

So instead of just acting like a stable coin (sell for $1, buy back for 98/99c) they actually use their bitfinex exchange and the unlimited supply of tether they control to push craploads of fake volume through the exchanges and pump the price when needed. One example, just look at the various times when tether has had big print runs and it always lines up with a crashing bitcoin that just recovers/stabilises when the tether is printed and pushed through the exchanges.",

Unlike bean sacks or tulips, they had absolutely no cost (or inherent value) -- so the \"speculatory inflation\" was pure, even purer, than the beaniest bean bag.\n\nFrom that perspective, yes, even now you could have made more than the beanie baby hype.

I sold software back in 2011 and a few people contacted me asking if they could pay for it with Bitcoin so I looked it up as I had never heard of it and said sure why not. I forgot about them until 2013 when I read an article about it and realised I had a lot of money in Bitcoin just stashed away, forgotten about. Then in 2014/2015 I ran a popular Bitcoin gambling website which I made 5% fees from all deposits which ended up giving me a large amount of BTC as a result. I've been incrementally selling them off and buying more with the profits (swing trading) ever since but in the last few weeks I have been selling the majority of them off as it doesn't look good for the BTC market currently.

But it still is a considerable amount of money to lose 35k, also considering the fact that i earn 12k a month only since august and before that it was 6k a month. Only positive btc and crypto brought me was i invested more time in my company to go from 6k to 12k, since I saw the money invested in crypto being evaporated and didn't like losing so much money. This last drop drives me to compensate the loss with my company even more. I expect to earn appr. 20k a month in a couple of months, but this is never a sure thing with business. Still stressed because of losing 35k. But there are more important things to me than only money. Still, I don't like it at all to lose so much money. I guess i'm a good businessman but a very bad investor, whatever that means. On the other hand, one thing I learned in life is: it's all about luck. There are people in worse circunstamces than me, so I understand them completely when they are angry or stressed.",

Like I said, I lost alot with crypto, but also run out of money because I had to pay for some health issues. I also dealt with a competitor who was becoming more and more aggressive. So i felt stuck and had to do something. I needed to find a way to increase my revenue/ money. I thought about it a couple of months. At first i thought i had to hire more people (and accept lower revenue and even loss the first year) to hold my position in the market and then slowly build up the revenue. I hired one additional person. Then I met someone who did freelancework for the service i sell. He didn't perform his job well, so i wanted to stop hiring him. But he was persistent and he was easy with communication and was goal oriented. Basically a sales mentality. I gave him another order from another service the company gives to clients. He was better at this task and also was able to sell it for a high price to clients. Not only that, he gave one client an extra service which wasn't part of the normal service i give. This gave me an idea to give this same service to other clients. I doubled my revenues and salary with this since september. It was a hole in the market. But there are always dangers, so i'm cautious. \n\n \n",
