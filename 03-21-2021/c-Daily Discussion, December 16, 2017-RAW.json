Consumerism leads to waste, demand for oil (as we cannot produce enough energy without it currently), war, and pollution.\n\nBitcoin can help stop the hasty-wasty purchases of everyday individuals which result invariably in garbage in landfills, carbon in the atmosphere, and plastic in the ocean. Bitcoin is driving energy demand for the world to a no-longer-ignorable level **which is good**. Let's invest in solar, wind, and hydro. We should be able to retain so much more energy from the sun than we currently are! What are the energy costs of Wall Street? Bailouts? Quantitative easing?\n\nThe government is not devaluing your money - they are devaluing your labor and your risk taking!\n\nStop the bleeding. Stop the madness.",

I've been holding a small amount of btc for about two years, selling and buying here and there on coinbase. recently started watching GDAX and trying to understand the order book and line charts and graphs. It seemed like it was a long drawn out steady climb to ~19000, a large pause at 18,999.99 and 19,000 for about 5 minutes, then in an instant it was 18700. Is it a single large sell that ca n manipulate the volatility like that?",

Now in coinbase I received .0029 bitcoin. Is it really possible that there was a 50 dollar fee to send a $100 of bitcoin from a wallet? Kind of annoyed, I would not have sent it if I had known I would lose half of it. Any way to reverse it?",

There's a small sector of honest and educated middle class citizen who are protecting their savings with btc, for inflation is massive in our country. There is MASSIVE volume coming from the military headquarters and the government infrastructure as btc is being used for money laundering and the hiding of massive amounts of capital from corruption. In short terms, there is a lot of volume coming from Venezuela, but not the kind of volume that is helpful for btc, it's just making a bad image of Bitcoin as a alternative. Hope this helps :)",

You don't want to invest money that would go to pay your mortgage, your bills, put food on the table, or even contribute to a retirement account. If you're putting money into bitcoin instead of another hobby or even putting money into a savings account, you still don't want to lose it, but having that money disappear won't change your overall lifestyle or put you at risk for being homeless. That is what i take from the advice \"only invest what you're willing to lose.\"",

Much more secure than relying on Coinbase to exist in 18 years or whenever your nephew would like to take our his currency. \n\nJust my thoughts. Just make sure you keep a backup of the paper wallet just in case it gets lost ",

So your profits will be $357.\nYou can replace 17500 with whatever starting price you want and 30000 with whatever ending price you want. If x is less than your original investment, you lost money, if more, you have profited. \n\nYou use the above equation because 500/17500 gives you a fraction of a full bitcoin you own with your $500 investment. So, when the price increases to 30k, you still own the same bitcoin fraction but your initial investment must increase in order to keep the same bitcoin fraction.",

            "Text": "Sure, but at what point does the total value stored in crypto make it un-crashable, $500b, $1,000B? The New Zealand dollar is often in the top ten traded currency, the country's GDP is around $175B. Is that (GDP) something to consider when discussing crypto? Is a valuation in US dollars even a long reality? It is now but I can imagine government regulated currencies being valued on a crypto benchmark value like it once was on gold. What is \"slowed down growth\"? Where can I park a few bucks today and get better than CD rates without similar risk? None of these questions can be answered yet. Two points for me are: A. so far this has been just \"extra money\" for me that typically I would have spent on some silly discretionary purchase and 2. every time some one says \"you hear about what is going on with this Bitcoin?\", I say \"sure, got into it a couple of years ago\". They always respond \"really I missed the boat\". The reality is that if someone bought in at $15,000/btc they would be pleased today. There are no answers right now, lots of valid and interesting points are being shared but how are the early evangelists of crypto any different than those the predicted internet use 50 years ago. ",

On a deep dive I am intrigued by blockchain, in fact, did a number of analysis papers for potential use in all sorts of other data integration apps. A couple of months ago I stumbled into a hashgraph talk in Chicago and was impressed by the application of old math and capacity. Sorry rambling. As my post indicates, I am already into Ethereum and Litecoin. If something else comes along that addresses the transaction processing issues before the proposed Lightning Network is working it might be adopted widely. I like the value store use case and don't need to consider Bitcoin, personally for anything else right now. All of us are part of a disruption the equivalent or greater to when printed currency replaced shiny metal.  Firstworld societies use cash, checks and debt cards, multiple credit card networks, wire transfers, etc. so I don't think this will end up being a single crypto globally at all but many addresses many uses. As I shared, I currently don't see any reason to move what I have in crypto now back to FIAT. If I were speculating or needed this for lifestyle purchases, I would not be motivated for getting into crypto.  I think this is very, very early in a huge disruption of finance and those of us into it are either paying for the learning experience or funding it and making (quite) a few shekels.",

I've been holding a small amount of btc for about two years, selling and buying here and there on coinbase. recently started watching GDAX and trying to understand the order book and line charts and graphs.  It seemed like it was a long drawn out steady climb to ~19000,  a large pause at 18,999.99 and 19,000 for about 5 minutes, then in an instant it was 18700.  Is it a single large sell that ca n manipulate the volatility like that?",

I wasn't paying as much attention to the GDAX the past few weeks, but on the depth chart we've got somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 coins to get to 25k from where we're at now as far as orders that have been placed already.  I'm not sure how that stacks up against the historical walls, but if you just follow the trendlines you'll see that past 20.1k it's pretty smooth heading to 25k, and virtually flat beyond there.   I'd imagine that if we're able to bust into the 25k range quickly then we are going to see explosive growth given that.  Seems a tall order, however.",

I did well today but that's because I had the time to watch and analyze the GDAX depth chart. \n\nBasically just look for a lot of activity and try to get a feel for how many coins are being bought in a given timeframe, and match that up against the limit orders which have been placed, and keep in mind that what you see with those is only a fraction of the larger overall activity.  You can identify walls upcoming in the short term, see how many coins they are, and compare that VS the coin buy rate per 10 mins or so.  If you are seeing a 1,000 coin wall and its taking 2 hours to break down a 30 coin wall then you have a guess as to how hard that is going to be to climb.  Make sense?\n\nI wouldn't call myself an expert or even necessarily follow my advice by any means.  I just try and identify patterns and sometimes do a good job of it, sometimes don't.  ",

Do I have to do anything special between generating public/private key pairs, or do I just generate it in 5 seconds and plug in my public key (after testing) to a place like coinbase to send the currency I have on there to my paper storage?\n\nYou want to generate the key pair on a secure offline computer to be safe, but you don't have to do anything special. Just send the coins to the address. You do want to triple check that it is the correct one. There are viruses that will change the public address in your clipboard, for example. \n\n>Additionally, what is the best way to check how much coins are in the wallet? Would there be a trusted app or way through command prompt where I plug the private key into to return a value?\n\nNo no no no no!\n\nDon't use the private key until you are ready to move the coins. To check the balance put the PUBLIC address into a block explorer like [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r).",

            "Text": "One scenario has macro- and micro-economic implications and one you pulled out of your rear. Not sure how 'teaching' anything is applicable here.\n\nHigher energy costs (resulting from higher demand) result in higher profit for the producers/suppliers. The current producers/suppliers (assume fossil fuel industry) will invest in alternative sources that align with their advantage - capital, technology - such as drilling in the tar sands in Canada. \n\nSeeing this higher profit, since there are substitutes *possible* but in many cases not yet *available* or *market ready*, other players may enter the energy generation and supply market. In order for them to enter the market, the return must be worthwhile on their investment. \n\nDo you want 99%+ efficient solar panels, fault-tolerant electric grids, off-peak optimized distribution systems, carbon capture? Of course you do! Do you want to *develop* them though? Do you have the capital and labor required to develop them? Likely, you'll need investment from external sources. A bank would gladly give you the money, if you have a convincing business model that indicates that it will receive its money back (and a share of any profit). Enter higher demand.\n\nNo where did I say to 'leave the lights' on but simply to not hinder progress by restricting energy consumption. The problem isn't the volume of consumption, it's the inefficiency and lack of alternatives. Restricting consumption won't lead to the development of alternative sources of energy - it will prolong the status quo of fossil-fuel driven pollution by artificially lowering prices *in favor of the dominant suppliers (oil, coal, natural gas)*.",

None of them are remotely close. \n\nIn my limited opinion bitcoin is the closest, it\u2019s the most stable, and is the most likely to eventually reach a saturation point that will give it stability. The more holders/nodes the more stable it becomes. \n\nAt that point it might actually be usable as a stable currency. We can assume a decade at least, so second layer apps will be fleshed out by then, perhaps being used for nano payments in the meantime?\n\nI.e. there really are some fundamentals with *huge* upside, even at its current price and its current problems. \n\nGuaranteed?

Instead of saving a kilowatt here, a kilowatt there - all I am advocating for is a shift in focus from worrying about energy *consumption* to *production*. We harness less than 0.000001% of the available energy provided by the sun to the Earth over any given time interval. If you want to find the largest 'bang for your buck' return, look into advancing solar power generation and storage.\n\nEvery hour spent worrying about energy use could, and should, have been expended figuring out how to get more, cleaner energy. The marginal return on capital *and* labor is highest in figuring out how to generate 'pollution-free' electricity. Until there is a viable, marketable alternative to fossil fuels, we will continue to burn them.\n\ntl;dr - We won't solve our environmental and energy crises simply by burning less fossil fuels. Over 95% of the remaining required effort to do so will come from initiatives that focus on generating more, cleaner electricity.",

Is that what you're talking about?\n\nSending Bitcoin via the blockchain does not cost near as much as Coinbase is charging their customers. This isn't entirely Coinbase's fault since fee estimation is very hard to get right, but the fact is that Coinbase is exacerbating the fee issue and has zero incentive to adapt because they are making a lot of money by overcharging. This isn't a problem with Bitcoin so much as it's a problem with Coinbase.",

Back in June I started gaining  interest in Blockchain (while my real focus was AI investing:ROBO, BOTZ, NVDA, BABA, BIDU, AAPL etc ) and BC seemed too esoteric and 'back office'. By October I waded into CCs, but not enough. Since then I've studied a lot and it seems this is not a BTC bubble per se - its a a new paradigm that may well play out like the Internet did between, say, late 2000 and 2005 (but at hyper-speed) - which is when Google, FB and true adoption / leverage too place. Gonna be a good ride for those who do their homework everyday. There should be a **Blockchain Implementation Investors Group** on /r IMO.\n\nEDIT: One other point - Google didn't go public until 2004 and FB not tie 2012 - while these 'coins' are essentially public now (however unregulated). Point is, you couldn't get in the door of either before their IPOs without connections and millions...",
