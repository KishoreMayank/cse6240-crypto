Today has been full of these accounts posting the same few topics, then having those immediately downvoted and remarked upon, then deleting them as they've failed. Since the negative karma will stay with the user score that posted, eventually they'll have to 'refill' elsewhere in another subreddit, or make a new account and pass around karma to each other. \n\nWhat a cancer in our daily thread. Mods, is there a solution to this? Higher account minimums to post won't really work since new users won't be able to participate in real discussion.

It was tax selling then and it is tax selling now.\n\nBUT,  the upcoming 'tax deadline dump'  will be a dud.  Why?  Many will simply file,  not pay their taxes,  just eat the penalty, then endure the interest thinking things will recover shortly.   In 2001 they didn't,  the tax overhang lasted years as people saw the interest accumulate,  yet no recovery,  and they couldn't hang on and sold at great loss. \n\nedit:  I put originally wrote pump,  it was an expected big 'dump' just before tax deadline that didn't materialize in 2001,  that is what I'm assuming will happen this April,  the tax selling effect started late Feb and will last well past April 17.",

We always want to make profit and guess but if it's at this price now and hits 1 trillion at the end of the year who cares. We just hit 800 billion marketcap a few months ago. Could honestly be 2-3 trillion by years end. Just get your dart boards out and toss money at any coin and you will gain over the year.",

            "Text": "> Any thoughts on how to approach the issue?\n\nYeah. Don't. Nobody gives a shit about CP anymore. It's the current year. We have bigger fish to fry. At this point after the multiple decades of crackdown operations we can be safely sure anyone still producing CP has a death wish. All those people just draw Japanese cartoons now and say they're 4000 years old aliens from Planet Alpha-Loli IV.\n\nWe should probably be more concerned about giving encryption and ease of communication to terrorists who want to kill people, not basement neckbeards who have nothing better to do than jerk it to old pictures of \"kids\" who are probably actually like 30 now.\n\nBut the answer to that problem is the same as this one: we aren't going to do anything about it, and we shouldn't. Not because it's not atrocious to kill people or to exploit children, but because **the alternative is far, far scarier**. \n\nThis is why, squick factors aside, we should have never, ever started down this slippery slope of \"illegal content\" in the first place. It was a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n",

Reducing available ways of attack typically includes changing default passwords, the removal of unnecessary software, unnecessary usernames or logins, and the disabling or removal of unnecessary services.\n\nThere are various methods of hardening Unix and Linux systems. This may involve, among other measures, applying a patch to the kernel such as Exec Shield or PaX; closing open network ports; and setting up intrusion-detection systems, firewalls and intrusion-prevention systems.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
