            "Text": "There was a time people confused BCH with BTC. The prices loosely followed each other. Well... Coinbase reports over the last week that BCH price has dropped 43%. But BTC seems to have hit the floor at a 12% drop from a week ago, and since 2.5 days ago holding steady around there. While BCH has continued over that same 2.5 days to fall another roughly 20%. Have we finally become unshackled?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course this may mean nothing if it's just measuring the pre-fork BCH price and not the new ABC/SV prices!",

But the dumbest thing I hear on this sub is that people are afraid to invest after the big spike and drop over this past year. That showed everyone what Bitcoin is capable of, without even being close to matured. People who buy Bitcoin are risk takers no doubt. Just like high risk stocks investors, gamblers, etc - people who love the rush of it. People who love the chance that the pay off will outweigh the risk.  There will NEVER be a shortage of people who want this, and now that we've seen that a small investment can go 10X and more in a short time, the risk takers will jump back in, make no mistake. That's what risk takers live for. Basically, stop saying stupid shit 'cough ..neveragain..cough...moron..cough. ",

As I said, some just get it and others don't. Those who don't, laugh for a few years while those who do, end up with the last and much longer laugh. There is no reason for this to discontinue.

But not a single crypto has value in society nor is it being used by the mass. You can call that a huge failure.",

But the dumbest thing I hear on this sub is that people are afraid to invest after the big spike and drop over this past year. That showed everyone what Bitcoin is capable of, without even being close to matured. People who buy Bitcoin are risk takers no doubt. Just like high risk stocks investors, gamblers, etc - people who love the rush of it. People who love the chance that the pay off will outweigh the risk.  There will NEVER be a shortage of people who want this, and now that we've seen that a small investment can go 10X and more in a short time, the risk takers will jump back in, make no mistake. That's what risk takers live for. Basically, stop saying stupid shit 'cough ..neveragain..cough...moron..cough.\n\nNah, people who buy bitcoin have miserable lives and are looking for an escape/shortcut. Risktaker is too much of a compliment. Also, hypes only come once, cause people have a memory. You just can't generate so much euphoria a second time, it won't be the same. Btc was a classic hype. Still, i believe it can get to higher price in the future, but it will be a long term investment just like stocks. The hype is over. ",

            "Text": "Well Microsoft was not always a huge company, but that's irrelevant because bitcoin is far more appropriately compared to the internet which also started out in a very small niche of users. It was slow, with not much use outside of networking whitepapers amongst a small group of military users. It was improved over 20 years or so with layers and protocols, and eventually adopted for individual use, but then criticized, called a massive waste of electricity and useless. Finally, it caught on. The biggest difference here is that bitcoin has been identified as a way to gamble via high risk investments and we've run with that use for now. \n\nI like many, am fine with that because it will help speed up  the transition to multiple other use cases over the coming years. I remember dial up internet well, and as smart as we all thought we were, very few were able to see where it was going. You are so far off base you are not even in the ball park.",

A lot of good news coming in the next few weeks on criptos and bitcoin and price will go up slowly when it gets to about 202 billion it will go up fast to about 217 b because of good news like sec or fidelity then as we all jump in bammmmm!!!! down to 150 billion just like that so just keep donating to the manipulators. orrr my suggestion is no money in until 300 b you wont miss the boat if this thing is going to take off 300 b is still early enuff to get in and then at like 290 b you hold the cards you can sell everything and let the manipulators stand there with there dks in there hands ,or you can risk it just wait for it ,wait for it ,wait for it so get out now bamm selll tonight and get back in at 120 b-150b it is going there for sure buy some gold with your money or some chines tec industry or 5g phone company's good luck\n\nLol what are you talking about bro\n",

You should care about keeping the asset in your pocket. It's a long term contract you're joining here. You believe in the technology, you believe in the revolution.\n\nWith that said, the lower it falls the less likely it is for it to fall further. Even though we lost that key support that kept us bottomed for the entirety of 2018, I can say that the risk of missing an opportunity of a great purchase is greater than the risk of you losing money at this point.",

If you take a step back and look at Bitcoin over the years you see that its a story of ever increasing integration into global financial networks, both institutional and P2P.\n\nBitcoin started having no market value as a computer science project by cypherpunks and cryptographers.\n\nThen it had a small market value; which then allowed it to be used for trade and created the darknet markets.\n\nThen for a while it was seen as a commodity entirely in the realm of criminals; and this phase lasted several years.\n\nThen over the past few years we've seen perception shift from anonymous criminal money to a disruptive Financial technology.\n\nUntil just a couple years ago exchanging Bitcoin for fiat was much more laborious. Now exchanges are peppered around the globe. \n\nBitcoin is represented by ETN's and other financial investment instruments; Futures; and maybe soon \"physically\" backed futures.\n\nThere is no one thing Bitcoin is waiting on or needs to succeed.

I see pictures of parties on Telegram groups all the time. All talk, no action. These people must be attacked, but we're dealing with zombies/cult members, not investors. Every time you hear a critical opinion, it's being shut down. Why are these companies not working and partying all the time? They need to WORK. They took the money and now they're talking and partying and posting pics on Telegramgroups. It's not a fucking Instagram contest. In case you wonder what this has to do with btc: adoption of crypto and blockchain in society is good for btc. But there is no pressure on these companies by investors aka fools aka cultmembers, throwing their money away instead of putting pressure on these companies to start deliver something. Nobody's working, it's the .com bubble all over again. They took the money and went partying.",

Why things are not going to come back this time. And they are always wrong. You may notice they do exactly the same thing at Peaks. This Time It's Different. This is why it's going substantially higher . and each time they are wrong. I think the overwhelming majority of the population has this emotional decision making process going on in their brain. It's something I don't. I'm not emotional at all really. Like when I was younger I watched someone get killed in front of me and it didn't even phase me. I went back to eating my lunch and didn't give it a second thought. Now that may seem bizarre but it's just how I'm wired and it's been really beneficial to understanding markets. What I have noticed is most people tend to have very strong emotional reactions at Market extremes and I use that to figure out where we are in Cycles along with technical indicators and even fundamental ones.\n\nI think there is a reasonable probability where we are now is the same as January 2015. The s&p500 is also at a major turning point. I don't actually expect the markets to unload until late next year but we are seeing the first cracks in this decade-long bull market",

Just like medical/legal tv dramas, or yahoo then google, or betamax then blu-ray. Fads keep us cycling over and over but I believe bitcoin as a technology will be used.

            "Text": "This isn't true about FIAT. It IS true about FIAT on the world market, not the local one. For instance, some idiot said that if the value of the dollar weakens globally, that my rent will change month to month. I have a signed lease for the next 5 years that my lease prices are set in FIAT. So, no matter what happens between the USD and say, EURO, the rent will still be the same $1400 month. That's the whole point of contracts. \n\nNow, the only caveat to this is the idea of 'utter chaos' in which the dollar collapses like Greece. If the US Dollar suddenly collapses then the entire global economy will go with it because everyone buys each other's debt in a circle because all the countries are interconnected. Because of this, there is little reason to allow a catostrophic FIAT crash on the global scale. All the key players want their FIAT to succeed, so they will come together and halt any weakening or problems. \n\nIn the meantime, my rent will still be $1400 over the next 5 years.",

You can create a decentralized identity based off of your public/private keys and choose what data big companies can get from you. You can create a side chain that allows dapps. Because the dapps could have a code hash it's like having a checksum built in, therefore showing the code on the site hasn't been tainted and is safe in addition to an ssl certificate.",
