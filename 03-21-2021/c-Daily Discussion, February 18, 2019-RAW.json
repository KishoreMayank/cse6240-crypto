One thing I know for sure is that when a weekly or monthly sentiment breaks out on Reddit, the market tends to follow the opposite afterwards. In early December people were getting upvoted for saying 1k in 2 months. Now I am getting downvoted for being pro bitcoin but neutral instead of bullish. Not saying you guys necessarily fall into this category, but after a couple days like this, there are a lot of people who think they are badass hodlers and not in it to get rich and then when the market doesn't play out the way they think they reverse course. Myself and others all took that path. Bitcoin needs to be boring to spark the next decent run. People need to quit caring what's its doing or checking its prices, and stop making memes after a $200 increase. Cause the truth is that type of excitement leads to mini sell offs.  ",
