But my mistake was  trying to give everyone a heads up that it would very likely start at the days close on Wednesday. The lines had not crossed yet by then. It took another 2 days to have a clean crossover imo. \nThat is why I am only taking partial credit for the call. \n\nI do not often try to predict short term price action, because it is often very hard or impossible, but I will try harder in the future to be more precise.
