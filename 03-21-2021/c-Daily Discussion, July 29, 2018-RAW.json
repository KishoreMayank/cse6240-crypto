Should wave-e equal a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c, it would do so at around $7,958 (BITFINEX) \u2014and converging trendlines of the triangle suggest by mid to late JUL. It is common for this final wave-e of a triangle to either undershoot or overshoot the converging trendlines of the triangle. However, this wave-e must terminate below wave-c for the overall triangle to remain valid; i.e. below the MAY high of $9,990 (BITFINEX). Summary of targets to complete the triangle (BITFINEX):\n\nTextbook:\n\n     @7873: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 50% of wave-d\n     @7958: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.618% of wave-c    \n\nOvershoot:\n\n     @8372: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 61.8% of wave-d\n     @8557: wave-e equals a Fibonacci 0.786% of wave-c \u2014REACHED WITHIN $50\n     @9084: wave-e retraces a Fibonacci 78.6% of wave-d\n\nOnce the triangle completes, the second leg, and most devastating leg, of the cryptocurrency bear market is expected to resume with a breakout in volume and volatility \u2014the crash redux. Taking out $7,330 may commence the second leg of the bear market, at which point signals time to exit ALL cryptocurrencies.\n\nInitial expectation for the second leg bear market is towards $4,257 (BITFINEX).\n\n\n\n____\n**^https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/913xx6/2018_cryptocurrency_crash_elliott_wave_redux**\n\n^#10kNeverAgain, ^#9kNeverAgain",

The future of Bitcoin looks bright indeed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(Excerpts)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>**Ques: Do you think SEC will approve the Bitcoin ETF application this time?**\n> \n>&nbsp;\n>\n>This ETF is structured a bit different than the previous one. First of all, it has a CBOE as a sponsor and VanEck is a traditional finance player that is making the proposition. I have read through the proposal which is about 50 pages. It includes one of the best explanations I\u2019ve ever seen about what a bitcoin is, what mining is, what is cold storage and the market in general.  \n> \n>&nbsp; \n>First, the contract size is going to be twenty-five bitcoins which are clearly aimed for institutional players, they are not coming here to pitch this to the average retirement portfolio.  \n> \n>&nbsp;\n>That\u2019s going to be one thing that could help persuade the SEC. The other is the market is much more well-defined now and much more developed. So the SEC has already clarified the status of Bitcoin at that point saying it\u2019s certainly not a security or anything like that.  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n>And the OTC market is also more developed now. So we have telephone transactions between the counterparties that are larger. Coinbase has recently opened OTC desks. We at eToro have opened an OTC desk so it\u2019s going to be a lot easier for them to get the liquidity that they need.\n> \n>&nbsp;\n> \n>**Ques: Talking about the predictions, people are making huge predictions and talking about millions of dollars. So what do you think about that?**  \n> \n>&nbsp;\n>\n>**Mati:** I mean if you look at it in percentage terms those services that we talked about some of them have been quite sizable in percentage terms. Even in 2017 the surge wasn\u2019t particularly large nor was the true retracement. It\u2019s simply that we\u2019ve come to a point where it\u2019s a much larger market and the larger the market gets the more those surges should relax. So the more people that are using and holding bitcoin, the less the volatility at the end of the day.   \n> \n>&nbsp;\n>Now for Bitcoin to become you know more or less stable cryptocurrency, I think that we would need to see a much larger market cap that could really take years to effect. We have noticed that with every cycle the volatility is reducing.  \n>\n>&nbsp;\n>We definitely have a price much larger than it is today. So I don\u2019t know. I suppose it\u2019s possible on a long enough timeline given that it continues to be the dominant cryptocurrency in the space and I don\u2019t see any reason for that to change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://coinnewstelegraph.com/will-sec-approve-bitcoin-etf-interview-with-mati-greenspan-senior-analyst-etoro/\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n[-Hopium Time Archives-](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/)",
