Here is a comment I posted summarizing my logic on this.  \nSaying blockchain is the real bubble and not Bitcoin - It's like saying the endless list of companies that jumped on the dot com bandwagon, adding the dot com online portion of business to their model without any real implementation of it were a bubble, but some companies such as Amazon were the real deal.  \nVery similarly, recently there was a wave of companies that added 'blockchain' to their business model and saw a surge in stock price only to crash again shortly after. There was also a wave of ICOs, raising millions on nothing but the concept of a blockchain project. But Bitcoin, the real original and functional blockchain, running stable with 99.99&#37; up time for 10 years and not one transaction compromised, is amazing.\n\n  \nI think many have been getting it wrong - Bitcoin is not the bubble, blockchain is. Bitcoin just had a bubble period in its price growth during the awareness stage in late 2017. It's still on the rise and only now beginning to see real progress in terms of infrastructure and real adoption.\n\nThoughts?",

Those warnings were routinely dismissed (you don't understand the technology! but the blockchain! there are only 21 Million coins, blah blah blah, etc etc etc).\n\nAs soon as we said this is LIKE Tulips, or Beanie Babies or other speculative bubbles with no real foundation in value we were greeted with endless drivel about how it this couldn't possibly be like Tulips (tulips are flowers you fucking moron) or Beanie Babies (this is a distributive ledger, not stuffed animals).  \n\nAll of that was quite besides the point and completely missed how it was like those speculative bubbles - which ALL work in exactly the same way on the way up when emotion takes over and there is always a greater fool, driving the price even further. . .and that momentum itself creates greater fools.  \n\nAnd they all end the same way - they run out of fools.  Eventually the idiots at the top are the ones stuck, and the whole thing collapses.  Has nothing to do with the underlying asset is - that's just the MaGuffin.  It could literally be anything, Tulips, Beanie Babies. . .digital chits. . .\n\nAnyway, the rest is history, it's now 1/3rds ATH headed to 1/4 ATH. . .\n\nCould this give away all gains in the last 12 months?  You bet.  \n\nCould this take years to build back any confidence - undeniably it will. \n\nCould something happen in those next couple of years that drive it to nothing?  Maybe more likely than not.\n\nThat's not to say, don't play this game - if you have fun - do it!  Just make sure you're playing with Monopoly money.  Money that you literally do not need for any reason at all - and wouldn't care if it disappeared.  \n\nThis is a lottery ticket.  You may make some money, probably not, only use mad money and you'll be fine.",

I hate to plug my investments, but if someone said hey I'll sell you an xbox for 5 shares of MU stock, I would tell them no way because Micron is going to go up 30&#37; by next year. Bitcoin is no different and provides an excellent example of why some inflation is a good thing when it comes to currencies.",

Only If you had to. \nSo Stop thinking Bitcoin will ever be a currency. It is going to replace 1/4 of the gold reserves.\nWhat that means? 1 Bitcoin is going to be something around 250 000 Dollar. \nBitcoin is here to stay. But not as a currency rather the digital gold! \n\nTo be honest i dont give a fuck If you hodl or Shit. To me all the \"hodlers\" sound like some stupid assholes.\n\nWhat i am trying to tell you here is, If you want you can sell. There is nothing wrong with it. Anytime soon when you are liquid again you can buy and invest in the digital gold.\n\nSo stay relaxed and ACT like a man. Make your choice Brothers and Sisters.\n",

You really think people who bought Bitcoin in hopes they'd double or triple their investment sold it because of speed or transaction fees? Really??\n\nYou're talking about Bitcoin like you just starting to get involved in it last year and expect the whole integration of Bitcoin to happen in a year lol. It takes way way longer than that, just as all disruptive tech has before. Bitcoin will almost certainly progress. And if you talk with developers who contribute to the open source code or look at how many times anything in the past has developed, you'll see that very little is ever accomplished without trying things and testing upgrades...because that's how you get it right..you fail a few times.\n\nThe other problem here is that you're evaluating the entire network and tech based on your emotional response to the price of the token. That's not common sense, that's not even sane.",

Really no different than buying $1k and selling $5k.\n\nAnyway, the price continued to climb to $1200, and I watched from the bleachers,\n\nIt tumbled, tumbled, tumbled, and I was glad not to be a part of it, because I was a total chicken little - 'The sky is falling!' - at every price $20+.  It was cathartic in some way being vindicated, even though the price was settled WAY higher than I had bought.\n\nMy brother had bought me 1 btc at $90 as an xmas gift that year.  I felt SUPER bad about it and tried to talk him out.  \"You're wasting your money.... but thank you so much anyway...\"  It was a generous gift, but I knew deep down he was way overpaying.\n\nAnyway I held that btc and sold it on gyft to buy a gamestop gift card and bought an xbox one at launch, with change leftover.  I was happy for that.\n\nIdk where I was going with this but that was basically my story.  Did it feel different?  Not a bit.  Think in terms of percentages, and it was basically the exact same.  People tell me I am insane for having sold at $9, but they are incapable of relating it back to real terms, the equivalent of having bought at $4k and selling at $18k.  \n\nThe USD-BTC raw quantities make no matter in this regard, because even back in those days, people were investing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars into it.  People pretend bitcoin mania did not hit until 2017 but it was very very real in 2013.  \n\nAnyway, yeah, it's just about all the same, and it hurts just as much.\n\nAs a side note, in the past couple years I invested about $12000 into Ignite Restaurant Group (IRG), and lost every penny.  I've since learned a very costly lesson about cutting losses short and not being emotional.  Like every gambler eventually says, \"What I wouldn't do to be down *just* 50% again...\"\n\n",

            "Text": "> I'm curious if the general mood and vitriol on both sides was similar during previous crashes?\n\nYes, the general mood from reading forums is basically identical. Markets never change, the bear and bull market patterns are driven by emotions. This is true even outside of bitcoin with stuff like the stock market.\n\nAll these bears you see are mostly likely traders with short positions open. They make money when the price falls (until they close their position that is)\n\nThe only difference I see is that some of the emotional manipulation now happens on CNBC. Also there are more comments on this subreddit because it has more traffic/subscribers.",

A Waste of time for geeks. Pennies were lost. In fact, the most people I saw ripping their hair out of their heads, were mining friends who told themselves they had lost the perfect moment to sell the hundreds of Coins they had mined in their bedrooms. They weren't actually concerned about losing their investment... they hadn't made any!\n\nThis latest crash is different by several orders of magnitude. People have actually lost large sums of investment. We are talking about investments in the order of thousands of dollars, if not millions. \n\nIn the first crash, little to almost no one was actually investing any serious money. The Bitcoin daily volume was very very low. It was like losing your lunch money. \n\nIn this last one, there were people who actually took loans and second mortgages to invest in Bitcoin. Insane!\n\nEdited: improved writing. ",

Media does this with pretty much everything crypto related because it makes them a fortune through ad clicks and views.\nA lot of miners are in pools, so the hardware would not really be in that 51%. Now that being said, the block being mined is still chosen by the pool authority and protocol but there are new protocols being proposed and this stuff will constantly be improved and upgraded. Everyone really needs to understand how much improvement will be made to the entire Bitcoin network over the next 5-10 years and that's the time frame you need to consider, not this day to day fiat price bullshit. Bitcoin is  being woven into the fabric of our society and the haters and morons who comment without any understanding of what is going in the world are just noise.",

I *do* believe that it will go up in the long run. But I don't know when it will be, and I don't know how low it will go before it turns around.\n\nSo yes, I'd recommend to cash out for now.\n\nBut the technology is evolving, Lightning Network is just in its infancy. Bitcoin has proven again and again that it's secure. PoW and transaction fees generate a decentralized system that is nearly indestructable. \n\nIt won't go away. No matter how low the price falls. Because when miners go out of business, the hashrate falls, difficulty adjusts... And mining stays profitable for the remaining miners. It's an ingenious concept!\n\nThe priceaction sucks. Many people are losing money. That's bad. But Bitcoin will stay. And someday it will be successful.\n\nJust not right away.",

Oh wait they still do\n\nThere was a time that people argued that housing was going to become worthless and you should just rent. Then housing turned around for a 100% gain in a lot of American cities\n\nThe thing about bubbles is if you're actually in one people don't realize it. At least most people don't and that was December. By the time they finally realize it's a bubble which is what's going on in here now oftentimes you're right about at the low. That was the case and housing. The most extreme pessimism is when the deals were the absolute best. That was the case with tech stocks. If you would have bought practically any decent tech company in 2003 it was a ridiculously easy return. It's when everyone was terrified of anything with the word Tech\n\nWe are at the same situation with Bitcoin right now. Could It Go lower? Sure. In fact it might. But it hasn't happened yet and we are still sitting right on support. I have a really hard time finding bearish comments in December and a very easy time finding them right now.

Each time sellers/shorters tried to dump the price, it was quickly reverted.\nI think (please correct me) that such strong defence is a good sign",

This has to be grass roots before mainstream. Lightning per all information out there is not ready for prime time. At this rate, it will be the next generation willing to give bitcoin another chance but that maybe enough. I just wished I could live to see decentralization of banking. This pace of development......... I don\u2019t know what to say. Everyone has theories but no one knows and anything you say is a guess. Maybe too many early holders to trust a currency owned by so few. Lightning would alleviate that mistrust allowing micropayments but segwit is only 40% adoption at best.

The alternative to government is chaos.  \n\nYeah... unfortunately, government is only sustained by using violence against dissenters, which is unforgivable. Believe me, death is better than life under a gun. You are likely privileged enough to scoff at this. Good for you.\n\n> Name me please one example of a truly free society in all of history that thrived and prospered.\n\nIn all of history there has never been a free society that did not collapse... including this one. You are living in the remains of a collapsed one today. But this is the nature of societies. Just as oppressed peoples rise up and destroy oppressive governments, the privileged don't understand the freedoms they have until they're gone.\n\n>You think cryptos is the answer?  Well, think again where the price of BTC is being decided.  90&#37; of the trading is carried out on shady exchanges in China and if you think the price is truly market driven, then you are naive and stupid.\n\nI'm not interested in namecalling or ad hominem attacks.\n\nYes, I think cryptocurrencies are a great step forward and a weapon for the people against a tyrannical government.\n\nNo, I am not concerned with the price manipulation. Price manipulation does not impact cryptocurrency's ability to evade taxation and censorship, literally starving the state slowly to death as it finds itself powerless to pay its enforcers.\n\nAlthough I do not personally involve myself with illegal activity, I am very, very excited about the impunity cryptocurrency can provide to those who fight for freedom on all fronts.",

So all I can say, in a non-argumentative way... were you actually there?  Because I was sitting in the freenode IRC every day, and on the bitcoin forums, and even on this subreddit, and it felt very much every bit as real.  Regular people invested $20,000 then, and they invested $20,000 now.  It makes no difference how many btc it bought.  There was still a lot of money at play.\n\nIt very well may feel different if you were at a different time financially in your life.  If you were only 19 playing around with $500, then it is child's play.  And 6 years later, it can feel like the real deal at magnitudes larger.  But it is just perspective.\n\nThat is simply my take on it, I'm not downvoting or arguing, like I said I wish I could say this with a polite tone, I don't want to come off wrong.  But there were just so many people invested then.  Even a $1000 bitcoin required a huge market cap back then.",

When people see the price at 3K, 4K, 10K, it strangely drives their idea for how much money they should invest, like \"What's the point of investing if I don't own full bitcoins?\"\n\nI will admit that during the run from like 10K to 13K I was thinking, \"well, better mortgage the house.\" laziness prevailed.\n\nWhile I'm glad that I'm not in that position I do feel bad for people that put in everything when it was at 19K. Like you said that's life-changing money and in previous crashes that wasn't the case.",

Bitcoin is a global currency digitally stored and if you think it's even CLOSE to going away I'm not sure there's not anything else that can be said until you stop forming an opinion without any real world knowledge. Name 5 countries that are implementing it, name 5 decentralized exchanges and give a short explanation of each one's model, and listen to a handful of interviews from people like Jimmy Song (Bitcoin developer). That's nothing but at least then you may have had to learn enough to see what's going on globally.",

Seemed like quite a hassle, tying up the phone line, dialing up sometimes multiple times to connect, and then waiting for ages to download anything of any size, etc. It took years and years to get DSL and then finally fiber and we are not near where we will be in another decade.\nYou get my point. Wallet address translation, functioning layers on the network, easier purchasing and storage, and much more will happen over the next few years.\nYou said Bitcoin has been around a decade right? Well that's the foundation that gives faith to build on. But remember until last year, most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was! Just wait and see what happens in the next few years. Bitcoin will get legs and walk, eventually run and shit will get real.",

They just have to crack down on the merchants and impose heavy fines/jail if they accept cryptos.  If you can't buy/sell using cryptos, then it's as good as dead.",

The power of a global currency is incredible and before long many of the possibilities for application and benefit of Bitcoin will be realized. You see signals that your country's currency is going to drop in value soon ..move it to a global hedge and retain that value. Or in the case of Bitcoin, potentially increase that value since Bitcoin has most likely taken the heavy hits and changing direction very soon. Remember, most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was a year ago. The awareness stage is only now upon us. Can you even imagine 5 years from now??",

In my group of friends who were mining, we never put one single cent into it. We mined everything. \n\nOne of my friends developed a serious depression, because people in his group of friends, convinced him that Bitcoin was a stupid idea and a waste of energy, to have his computer always turned on to mine. I remember perfectly when I told him that Bitcoin had reached 100$. He completely forgot about it and then blamed himself for having listen to his other friends. I told me that he had sold around 80% of the Bitcoins he had mined (around 2K BTC) at around 20$. A few weeks later, I can't recall exactly when, he was at home with a serious depression and a medical leave. Not because he had lost money, but because he could have earned a lot more.\n\n> That is simply my take on it, I'm not downvoting or arguing, like I said I wish I could say this with a polite tone\n\nNo worries.

Not that I want to indulge you making things up on the internet (because who would do that), but let's do the maths on what this made up merchant is actually saving in transaction fees.\n\nTypically a merchant will pay half a percent using Visa or Mastercard (usually they'll charge a 1&#37;-1.5&#37; fee on using a card so they actually make money on you using a card, but let's forget that). Average convenience stores do 3.5M in revenue each year (per [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-gross-revenue-convenience-store-35712.html](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-gross-revenue-convenience-store-35712.html)). That seems a bit high for Crystal Lake, Iowa, so let's assume a cool 2M in annual revenue.\n\nLet's also assume that Iowa sports the highest population of bitcoin users in the word with 1 in 10 people paying using LN. At most this merchant has saved $2M x 10&#37; x 0.5&#37;  ... over a whole year: a whopping $1000.\n\nWhy would any merchant risk bitcoin's instability (LN still in beta, bitcoin down 15&#37; this month, 51&#37; the past six months) to save $1000?\n\nWe get it - you're excited about bitcoin and LN - but when you talk shit and spread stupid lies it makes the whole community look like ridiculous fanboys.",

Now is the time to get the \"old guard\" invested heavily enough to create a strong interest for governments not to ban crypto even though it would be in their long term best interest.\n\nIf you have doubts about this, check out what the all-powerful governments are doing about climate change. :P that's right; nothing... because it turns out there is a lot of money tied up in ruining the world for everyone.\n\nI believe we are already there to a degree. Banning crypto is a dangerous game. It's a race into a new industry and a government has two choices: 1) ban/regulate it and stifle innovation on their own soil, giving other nations the win, or 2) deal with it for now and get violent when the time comes.\n\nNaturally I am hoping for 2, and when it comes time for the endgame, the armies simply have no account to draw their paychecks from.",

The internet started in the 60s and most people never even heard of it until years and years later. Bitcoin is very much like it. Ask anyone who contributes code to the core. \n\nAnd seriously man, like no disrespect but you gotta stop saying it failed because it didn't deliver in December or whatever. I mean that was less than a year ago. You can believe me or not but that kind of progress takes a long time. Code needs to be reviewed under open source protocol and then tested under load. It takes many attempts and even non open source like Microsoft and Apple take multiple attempts many times.",

I don't think it will ever happen, but there could be some major technological advances over the next decade or so that make it possible. If that happens, the current prices are perhaps justified.\n\n>The value is in the incredible stability of the network, Not one single compromised transaction in it's 10 year run.\n\nIt doesn't have the capacity to do enough transactions to go beyond a tiny niche group of users. It had some value for drug dealers years ago, but has now been replaced by better performing cryptocurrencies.\n\n>Sounds like a hell of a safe place to store value\n\nIt lost 70% of it's value in a couple months. In what possible universe is that a safe store of value?\n\n>Can banks say that?\n\nBanks are a million times safer than bitcoin. In the last few months, tons of people have lost everything when exchanges get hacked or their passwords get compromised. I don't lose a penny if my bank gets hacked. When I lost my bank password, I just reset it. In the last 6 months, my bank account gained 1% during the time that bitcoin lost 70%.\n\n>The hardware and electricity used to mine and secure the transaction hold plenty of value\n\nOwning bitcoin doesn't give you any ownership of the hardware or electricity. That value is completely wasted. Bitcoin destroys valuable energy in return for useless tokens.\n\n>What about when the next generation of digitally savvy investors come online?\n\nDigitally savvy investors stay clear of asset bubbles and ponzi schemes. The price is tanking now because the supply of suckers is running out.\n\n\n",
