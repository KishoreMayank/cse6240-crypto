            "Text": "It's annoying to see people professionally try and speculate on what causes the price to go up and down. Use a little common sense, ignore cointelegraph, forbes and nonsense youtubers. Something like Bitcoin doesn't just become valuable to likes of $6,454.00 for no reason at all. It has real use in the blackmarket and makes payments in today\u2019s economy easier for businesses, persons & governments.\n\nScenario's that affect it's trading cycle are the following:\n\n\\- Rival Coins & Technology\n\n\\- Adoption\n\n\\- \"Laws\" & \"Regulation\" (This being the most important one!)\n\nI'll put the current price drop all down to the scheduled EU re-meet for the end of this month, were likely to see the price drop down even further leading upto the last week of June when it's discussed on an international level. If you truly followed Bitcoin and \"believed\" in it, you would have realised this and sold on the last high of \u00a37,100 and would be waiting buy back in at this time. Most professional Bitcoin traders knew the price would fall in mid June-July. Wait for it folks, i'd say \u00a34,500 would be safe price to go in at but i have my alert set at \u00a34,200. Keep dedicating time to understanding it all, everything involving money is linked together.\n\n\\- Windy",

Your old version will continue to work. Updating software is always a good idea.\n\n>What's the difference between this and a hard fork?\n\nA hard fork is a fundamentally different thing. A hard fork is simply the clone of your program but it's no longer compatible with your program (as in bitcoin cash vs bitcoin) or a different approach (like in LibreOffice and OpenOffice). Hard forks are usually a total different team splitting away from the original program towards a (in their eyes) \"way better solution\". A simple software update like this is in no way connected to a hard fork.\n\n>If a backdoor is placed and no one notices it for God knows we don't  read enough and even so 99&#37; of the people who took the time wouldn't  understand 1&#37; of the code.... Wouldn't it crash everything?\n\nA lot of people are contributing to bitcoin. A lot of people are reading differences between this and the last version which is easy to do. Each piece of new code submitted to bitcoin is heavily reviewed and Acknowledged before it's merged into the master. Google \"pull requests\". One could not simply walk into master with his own code. Technically it could \"crash everything\" but that will not happen. It just won't.\n\n>If some one with enough btc moves to another version wouldn't everyone follow suit without even questioning it like a herd?\n\nWe're talking about a simple software update here, not about a complete other system where someone with huge amounts of btc moves into. A software update happens from time to time and everyone is just updating software because it's a good thing.\n\nEdit: OOOH, it's my cake day <3",

Nobody really knows.\n\nIf you imagine BTC eventually achieved the same market cap as gold, then that figure divided by 21 million would give one indication of value of 1 BTC, as there will never be more than 21 million in circulation.\n\nAlternatively, you could speculate that BTC could be responsible for, say, 1% of World trade transactions, and use that figure.\n\nWho knows? :)",

If you just push the sell button on a market exchange the price will indeed drop one hell of a lot. Or, you could wait for better news and you can use what you have to push for things that you know are going to draw in people and then when it goes on a tear you can slowly start selling some of your coins into the strength. The Winklevoss twins are a great example of this. They have a ton of Bitcoin. They can sell everyone they have right now and they would have made just a ridiculous profit. They don't because they know they would literally be selling the bottom. \n\nIf you have a couple hundred dollars in your bank account right now I know it probably sounds cool to think that if you had 50 Bitcoin or whatever you could just sell them at this price and your lifestyle would be quite a lot better. That's true and people have. That said a lot of these large wallets are held by people who don't have to worry about money anymore. It's numbers on a screen and just like an 80s video game when you are trying to run up points. The whole goal is to get as many points as possible",
