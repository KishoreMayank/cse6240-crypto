            "Text": "So, educate me, because I am a Debbie Downer.\n\nHypothetically, let's say using Bitcoin for Purchases is only 1% as opposed to the 3% merchants pay, and that the merchant processing company converts it automatically back to FIAT and deposits it into their bank for that 1%. \n\nAnd, hypothetically you the customer would have to pay a small fee to convert your FIAT in America to Bitcoin to buy something in Bitcoin, involving (1) an extra step, and (2) an incurred cost of conversion. \n\nSo, vendors would offer a 1% discount if you pay with Bitcoin, so that you the customer, save a very small amount, and the vendor saves a large amount over the cost of a month. \n\nThe question then is, will someone convert to bitcoin to merely save a few cents and also do the extra step? And what's there to prevent Visa or MasterCard from dropping their prices to small amounts too? After all, if they use blockchain technology, then every transaction becomes guaranteed and secure, and their costs drop as there is less fraud so they can lower the costs to the merchants.\n\nIs this accurate?",

My guess is that some big whales do not want the price to go below support. The safest option though would be to wait for the breakout. A lot of traders are waiting for the price to convincingly break 7000 before buying back in.",

You should consider what I've been saying for months, which is that bakkt is a positive thing ..but I've always said it can't be priced in, so you're being premature with your claims. Why don't you remember things as they were said? A bad memory is not a good sign xelephonte, not a good sign at all.\nThat being said, I still feel exactly the same. Bakkt is one of many positive developments coming into the picture that I believe will add to the growing infrastructure.

If you were investing for the long term (years) like me then this bear market means nothing, because it\u2019s temporary.  Back earlier this year when people were yelling HODL, we were trying to prevent an irrational bear market from taking hold. We lost. However, the market could very well have turned around faster than anyone expected, so hodling could have been a good idea even in the short term.  Again if you are not a daytrader, but instead are a long term investor than HODLING has been proven to be the right strategy during bitcoin\u2019s 9 year track record. And I believe this will continue to be true in the years to come. ",

If this was a certain investment it would not have the ability to generate returns. That element of risk and not knowing if it's going to continue is what separates people. A lot of people look at this and they see the price decline this year and they think that is going to continue forever and the whole thing is over. Many of those people have already sold. It's even more common with this new breed of Internet skeptic. Very few people have been able to hang on through the Long Haul. Bitcoin is very good at breaking almost everyone with fear panic and emotion even though like I said earlier. All you have to do is throw a dart on a chart and the price will be lower than it is today. You have around a 97% chance of that Dart hitting a lower number than where we are right now",
