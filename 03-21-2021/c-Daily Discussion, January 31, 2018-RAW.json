            "Text": "I was always afraid to buy Bitcoin when it was in the media because I figured it would be a bubble. Didn't buy at \u20ac100. Didn't buy at \u20ac1000. Then when it rose to \u20ac10k I finally went \"fuck it\" and bought a lot. I even managed to sell very close to its peak. Then when it started dropping again I figured that it would go back up quickly and re-invested everything plus some more at \u20ac13.7k. It's at fucking \u20ac7.7k right now. Pls send help.\n\nIn all seriousness though, I'm hodling. It's not like I have a choice at this point. Pretty much like everybody else.",

If the price does crash 90% from here, many people trying to mix into the HODLers' community will get flush out due to their fear. A lot of people use leverages too so they will rush out to the door when the price collapses. By then, the only HODLers left are the people who actually bought bitcoins for under $1000.",
