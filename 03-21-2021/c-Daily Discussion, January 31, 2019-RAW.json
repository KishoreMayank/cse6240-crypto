A CBOE spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the decision to withdraw its request was the result of the U.S. government shutdown as the end of the review period approached. Some legal experts noted at the time that the SEC was operating on a limited basis due the shutdown, which was the result of a political impasse over a proposed wall on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border.\n>\n>&nbsp;\n>\n>ETFs are securities that track a basket of assets proportionately represented in the fund\u2019s shares. They are seen by some as a potential step forward for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a regulated and passive investment instrument.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/cboe-re-applies-with-us-sec-to-list-bitcoin-exchange-traded-fund",
