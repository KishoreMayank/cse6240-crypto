            "Text": "Things seem a bit calmer now, I'm fairly neutral- slightly bullish even. Markets everywhere are frothy right now, with some tension in the air for a big crash on the equities markets at some indeterminate point in the future. Frankly I can't pretend to comment on short term fluctuations with any air of authority but I think heading towards  the end of Feb - early march is very promising. Why?\n\n* The fundamentals are strong. Regulatory environment is promising\n\n* Dust will settle from worldwide \ncorrection, \n\n* Fed is likely going to raise interest rates\n\n* Robinhood launches\n\n* lightning and segwit adoption will continue to increase (particularly amongst the key players) improving throughput & tx speed/cost and new utilities will be based on this tech that were previously cumbersome/unattractive. And then there's a laundry list of proposed BIP's im the pipeline\n\n* Perhaps most of all a large bit of the bad sentiment and doom and gloom hanging around will have been shook out. That simple. People wait for signals, for moments. It's a herd mentality\n\nI don't like making price predictions, and I think the market would really benefit from a period of sideways or steady, measured growth. End of Feb, march is what I am eyeing up for that to begin.\n\nI'm bullish in the medium term, and absolutely long term (although I think the last one goes without saying)",
