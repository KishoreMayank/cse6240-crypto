I am feeling very bearish on BTC (though I stay HODLing) because of this halvening. Miners are going to hit half the reward for mining a block of BTC which I think will only create anxiety and fear among whales. The whales see no momentum and they are the drivers behind the cryptocurrency market. Combine that with halvening and I can see utter chaos for the next couple weeks. Of course, old man Crytogrip will come around to tout his Bakkt which he has been doing since July but Bakkt remains a figment of the imagination. Halvening is here and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the entire market fails to $60 bill. The whales could be create a bull trap the past 2 days and following the next couple days. I could see BTC fall to $1700. Not trying to create FUD but this halvening process complicate things. Let me know if you agree/disagree...",

But, I\u2019m not a psychic and I could be very wrong. A recession is very ominous for many things except for investing in bargain stores like Dollartree and Walmart (since everyone is broke). Bitcoin is yet to be tested by a bad economy since it was created after the last recession. This is a test I\u2019m very curious about. Assume the worst, hope for the best.",

I believe in what the currency stands for and I have the strong feeling it will appreciate in the long run. \nWhat I can logically state about the present situation is that only a buyer under $3.4k can profit by selling now. Similarly only a buyer under $3k can profit by bringing it down there. And I strongly believe someone who is at a loss and has not sold by now would hardly do so from now on. Hope my two cents helped.",

Selling is becoming more and more exhausted and if we have not already hit bottom, then it's likely close. When you read all that crap about bitcoin going down way further, it's efforts of manipulation. And it doesn't just occur in the downward direction either - when headlines were calling for 100k by the end of 2018, that too was clickbait and manipulation. The best strategy is, and has always been, follow developments in the space, use common sense, and buy small amounts at a time to keep your average buy in check.",

He clearly did not know about the $3,000 limit of capital losses which is only for married people. For single people or married people that file as single, the most you can claim is $1,500. This is something I absolutely hate about the tax system. It\u2019s designed for you to get fucked. They get 50% on your capital gains but you can only claim $1,500 on capital losses. How messed up is that. But, it\u2019s hilarious to think that people really want to invest in Shitcoin after having just suffered massive losses. Take your tax refund and buy Bitcoin just so you can lose more money? I think not.",

Looking back at the bull run in 2017, it's absurd to think how many issues there were and nobody cared...issues that are since being solved or at least look to be in the near future. A knock on volume? Fine with me. That's what signals the consolidation period in previous bitcoin cycles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe undeniable truth is that thousands of bitcoin wallets are created each day, and transactions are going up. Yet the current bears are like 2017 bulls, just seeing no possibility of a reversal. They truly believe that bitcoin will be under a $100 in 2 years. Which is really cute. ",

Maintaining decentralisation has to be the first priority, as Luke says if you can't maintain decentralisation then there is no point in what we're doing here.\n\nIMO there are currently bigger reasons than data/computer resources as to why many don't set up nodes, mainly that many just don't see/understand its importance. It can take time to really appreciate what a node does and how you need to be running one in order to be using bitcoin with no trust. But if chain growth continues to out-do tech growth, that side of it could certainly become more pressing in the future.\n\nI don't think we could ever see a block size reduction now though, it would be almost impossible to achieve consensus on it unless the number of nodes gets dangerously low.",

There's been plenty of advances in payments that have simply been ignored by the bulk of the US public, eg contactless payments (apple pay, etc) and these are clear, obvious improvements. BTC is not a clear improvement, so what exactly is going to drive the price up?",

The second is realising that no one gets rich of a get rich scheme the second time around. It shot up due to speculation, if it's ever going to beat its ATH it'll be on fundamentals not speculation, and the fundamentals don't look great.",

But for making some gains on your money, including bitcoin in the high risk portion of your investments in the case that this thing continues to grow as it has been for a decade is not a bad move by any means. No, I don't agree with looking at only the first 9 years. To make an assessment using data, ALL the data must be used. Price will be up and down for a long time, but the building of a crypto ecosystem with bitcoin as the crown jewel has been VERY consistent and increasing over time. Anyone that thinks this is all going to stop being built at this point is most certainly not looking at all the data. ",
