Last week when we had the sharp upside reversal after testing 6100 we moved very quickly up to 6400 so there was massive buying/short covering from 6100 up to 6400 where we leveled off. If we start trading lower below 6400 for awhile i would be very concerned. Expect BTC to test recent lows if we are holding below 6400. As long as we can hold above we could move back to the upper range of 6700 and then see if we can build a higher low off of 6400. \n\nWe are at an important crossroad right now.",

Not to mention I would think Litecoin still has a place in small transactions, but again this is not something that can possibly happen overnight. \n\nBitcoin will most likely work as an alternative to fiat first, functioning as both an investment and store of value with multiple benefits to traditional gold. Certainly as a much more attractive option to the younger generation who have come to trust the security and accuracy of digital encryption and accounting.\n\nAnyway, the point is, the opportunity lies in getting in, while there are still people who raise doubt and uncertainty, because once it is a sure thing the investment opportunity will be gone, and the price will already have exponentially increased. That's how opportunity works.",

This is a hugely underestimated impact, as it has the potential to decouple advertising from internet content.  Everyone hates ads. LN means you can pay people a few pennies automatically instead of looking at ads.. without subscriptions and hassles. Do you have any idea how big the advertising market is?\n\nThird, nobody has to buy anything for something to have value. If enough people want BTC because it makes them feel fuzzy to own some, then that in itself is enough. You can get pretty far just on that; Gold has a substantially higher market cap, and most of the physical gold will never used to buy anything at all, or even be made into anything.. and gold can't easily be subdivided, verified, or sent distances.\n\n&#x200B;",

It's just a tool to easily identify market sentiment and more easily identify turning points. The most important thing to figure out is when to use it cause you cant just blindly pop up a chart, put your favorite TA in it and start trading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example during the hype period last year the herd behaviour of the masses was pretty easy exploitable with TA because this caused clear trends in the crypto's which could be exploited with TA. I traded pretty much everyday on the short term and made consistent profits doing so. Then the turning point came and the crashes started to happen which caused a change in TA strategy to be made but still buying the dips of these crashes could be exploited using TA. After that the masses left and volume and volatily just went to much down for me and i pretty much stopped trading the crypto markets. Now im just waiting for another hype period to happen to start following trends again or a big crash to buy the dip. ",
