            "Text": "The $250, 30-minute Bitcoin pump.\n\nLast night, there was a spontaneous $250 pump in 30 mins around 9:30 pm PST where Bitcoin soared from a median price of $6300 to $6550, which was observed most conspicuously among foreign exchanges. The pump wasn\u2019t so significant on Coinbase. Now, I suspected this pump to be a total bull trap and so far, I stand correct. But, what\u2019s behind this random bull trap that resulted in eating up stop-buy orders in the $6300-$6600 range?? Because that\u2019s what the whales do. Obviously, it was the whales and no one else...even though it could always be some lone wolf (the \u201cgo big or go home\u201d type of lone wolf), but I highly doubt it\u2019s a lone wolf since they have not come around in quite a while. These days have been extremely slow and the volume would not complement a lone wolf\u2019s conditions. Lone wolves particularly like to strike when there is more than moderate activity/volume. Lone wolves like to short Bitcoin. It was definitely the whales because that\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s been a long theory of mine that the whales have access to all the stop orders on exchanges, especially on foreign exchanges. This is why their moves are entirely calculated and they react to orders based on what is most financially beneficial or what move would allow them to collect more Bitcoin. I suspect Coinbase is rigged as well but I\u2019m not entirely sure. I know for sure BitMEX, BitForex, Bitfinex and Okex are rigged (basically any exchange that ends in \u201cx\u201d or \u201ck\u201d - they\u2019re all products of each other). Let me know if you agree/disagree or have other thoughts.",

Hell, there are still loads of people that struggle with organizing their email and the files on their PCs. \n\nSo if you want mainstream ownership of crypto, you can either wait a few generations or be thankful for platforms that will allow people to buy bitcoin with a buy button in a familiar type of interface from a company they trust with their investment, so they won't have to worry about wallet addresses and storage responsibilities.\n\nThen, just maybe, once people gain confidence in bitcoin, more people get on board, more get educated, more intuitive self-storage options open up and newer tech savvy generations enter the scene,  more and more people will start feeling confident with being responsible for their own bitcoin and crypto.",

They are relying heavily on their 401k's to provide for their golden years and soon you will have BAKKT, which by offering Bitcoin could give their portfolios one last substantial gain before they reach retirement age. Traditional markets begin to slow down after a 10 year bull cycle, cue massive amounts of boomer FOMO money coming back into the crypto market over the next year and a half and paving way for the most ridiculous bull run in BTC history. Institutional money has been accumulating at a discount all of 2018. After it breaches ATH again the amount of FOMO money coming in will make all of our heads spin. Around 60k we will hit $1T market cap and just keep going from there. People are converting their entire 401k to BTC, all timed nicely with the 2020 halving. The halving is not going to be the *cause* of the next parabolic run, but the spring is being loaded and could be let go right around that time. Predicting the bull market to start here soon but it won't be what you think. 2019 will be steady increase of 2 steps forward, one and a half steps back. We will have at least a year of steady growth before this thing takes off again like it did at the end of 2017...remember 2017's parabolic rise came from a slow steady bull market starting back in 2015.

If someone can look at the earnings of coinbase the first thing they think of is where are the earnings coming from. If you look at Bitcoin in a very basic way what you have is a legalized gambling parlor. They could look at it that way. If you look at it from a technology perspective, you have a technology that can move very large amounts of money much cheaper than conventional Banks. You have a technology that as it develops can offer lower fees for common transactions. About an hour ago I did a $350 sale. Customer swipes their credit card. We get 340 and change. That right there is the target. Think about all those small business owners out there using Square to swipe people. If people have the ability to pay with Bitcoin and could use it all easily you have a real threat to visa and MasterCard. It would not be hard to develop a side chain that even has the safety mechanisms like a customer service department. Chargeback protection. That might cost a little bit more but it gives businesses a chance to innovate on the blockchain. It also provides that real world use case rather than the one we have now which is basically digital cash",
