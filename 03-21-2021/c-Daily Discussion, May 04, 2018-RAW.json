I think we are still in this stage.  Do you agree?\n\n\nEarly Majority (34%) - maybe begins when price breaks 75k.  Early adopters finally got their family members to invest.  To the moon!!! \n\n\nLate Majority (34%) - price breaks 300k. People start to use it regularly as currency. \n\n\nLaggards (16%) - price breaks 1 million. Almost everyone knows about bitcoin and many are actively using it. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/",

That's a starting point.\n\n2)  Is Gold or BTC a better store of value or a better means of exchange?\n\nWell, BTC is very volatile - but the volatility trends upwards - so that's part of the appeal :)\n\nRegarding means of exchange: \n\nConsider this: if you have 10k's worth of gold under your bed, and wish to sell it - at the current 'market price' - How do you do that?  Think about it.  Where do you take it to sell it?  Fact is, you can't.  (Except maybe at a Cash for Gold type place, or some Gold scrap dealer, or on the black market, where you will lose 30-50% of its 'value.')\n\nIf you have 10k worth of BTC in your wallet, where can you exchange that? - hundreds of places, for a small percentage fee.\n\nSermon over.\n\n",

At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.\n\nView\n\nBTC looks set to test the 200-day MA resistance of $10,015. A close (as per UTC) above that level would strengthen the bull grip and could yield a sustained rally to $10,455 and above.\n\nThe outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the ascending 10-day MA, located at $9,290.\n\nAn unexpected close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low, pennant low) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.",

Once big players start accepting it (Amazon, alibaba etc) there's no reason for people to trade it for fiat which will increase the value drastically. I think it could honestly go well beyond even the highest expectations.\n\nNo one has ever seen this before and likely won't again until we can do away with the concept of money altogether.\n\nEdit: \n\nWhat will be really interesting though is what kind of price discovery happens when 1/1000 Satoshi payments are possible through lightning, and when price discovery stops being against fiat and actually happens against goods and services.\n\nI think that it could result in a crazy dynamic where goods become cheaper year over year, but people are also paid less year over year.\n\nThis could lead society away from over indulgence, to a more sharing focused and less wasteful mindset as we collectively realize everyone should have the opportunity to be wealthy, but not at the expense of one another.\n\n",

            "Text": ">but the volatility trends upwards\n\nWhy do you think that is? Because people have expectations for its future utility.\n\nNow ask yourself where the value of gold originates. It's not just scarcity. It's history, too. Gold once *had* utility as a means of exchange, in daily business. You cannot just replace it with something else that is scarce and maybe more easy to exchange and expect people to value it in the same way.\n\nNo. Bitcoin will only have real value, if it achieves a status as a kind of currency. Like gold did before. \n\nI'm betting a lot of money that it *will*. I believe that it will.\n\nBut if it won't, then it won't have any value at all.",

Bitcoins don't really exist)\n\nSo, you don't need to be online to receive bitcoins.",

Once your wallet is reconnected and updates with the current ledger, you will see a pending/completed transaction in your wallet.",
