Also keep in mind we have lightning in development and probably more solutions on the drawing board for hiding your funds. Currently all you have to do is generate a new wallet if you're dealing with somebody you aren't sure of or a business you've never met and so on\n\nNow if you really wanted to be careful you can keep all of your funds on one wallet, like a hardware wallet. Send that to an exchange and then from there fund a different wallet. Someone would have to go a lot of trouble to track that. If you were even more paranoid you could run your coins through Monero and then back to bitcoin",

Put all of your Bitcoin on a ledger. Make sure you have a working copy of the seed. Store it somewhere and forget about Bitcoin for awhile. Historically your odds are really good doing this because anyone that would have done it at any time before 2017 would be feeling pretty good right now. \n\nIf thinking about the price is getting to you my personal suggestion is to do the later before you have an emotional capitulation and do the former",
