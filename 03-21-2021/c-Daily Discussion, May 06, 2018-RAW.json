Currently its around 30% so there is plenty of room to grow assuming people dont have to use the legacy format. \n\nFees are not too bad right now so probably most people dont care, but there could be a surge in demand any time and at that point you will be glad if your wallet or favorite exchange support SegWit because it can save alot on fees, and the higher they get the more you save with SegWit :) So just wanted to get that off my chest. Have a nice day and happy trading or whatever it is you do :)",

Just normal marketmoves. \n\nSure when you are in a really strong bullrun you can burst though this levels because you will have way more buy than sell pressure. but we just had a 70&#37; crash.  So every strong level should be a slow grind. \\(I mean it is only slow grind for crypto market\\) . People should relax more. As long as we don't make a new lower local low which would be below 9k nothing really changed. Too many people watching 15 min charts. ",

There is no logical reason why changes in supply and demand would follow any of the indicator patterns you are tracking. \n\nA large portion of the buy and sell orders are placed by bots using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are specifically trained to maximize the return for the people that own the bots, not the clueless daytraders they are making the money from. Many of the people with the trading bots are using large amounts of money, which means they can actually move the markets, unlike you. These traders are called \"whales\". Anyone who denies their existance is an idiot, because it's very easy to see how much BTC they have in their wallets and when they trade since it's in the public blockchain. You can also clearly see the vertical lines in the price charts when a whale decides to move the price enough to cause margin calls for all the idiot daytraders using leverage.\n\nDo you even understand that day trading is a zero sum game. The only way a day trader makes money is by outsmarting or outguessing other day traders. Give the extremely primitive trading strategy you are using, it's obvious you are one of the traders who is providing profits for the smarter day traders using more sophisticated algorithms and more market power.",
