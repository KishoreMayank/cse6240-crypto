I'm in the middle of trying to send a Bitcoin transaction that would have cost me $.04 to send, but would have taken approximately 50 minutes to confirm.  Instead, I chose to send it with high priority, costing me $.55, and supposedly confirming in approximately 20 minutes.  That was 45 minutes ago.  I'm sorry, gang, but we have a long way to go before this technology is useable in any real sense, which makes the current price of it still way too high.  It's too volitile to be a store of value for most people (Venezuela and other unstable national currencies not-withstanding), and it's almost unuseable in its current state as a currency. While it's true there's a lot of ***potential*** for some really impressive use cases, at the current time they're on the fringe of everyday use.  From where I stand, $6600/BTC is laughably overpriced.",
