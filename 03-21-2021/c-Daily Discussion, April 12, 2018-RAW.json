And this subreddit found out about it?  And this billionaire went ahead with the plan,  just now,  and it backfired?  \n\nWould you modify that belief just slightly?\n\nHow about a famous and powerful billionaire and professional short,  cozies up to a handful of overwhelmed new and insanely rich exchange entrepreneurs,  who's shinny new money machines have just recently started seizing up as HODL takes a hold,  say late December 2017.   Said billionaire convinces said exchange owners to lend him bitcoin,  for a fee of course, ya know,  to replace the trading income that's disappearing?   Do that independently,  secretly, and simultaneously with just four or five exchanges,  and........\n\nOr not\n\n\n\n",

            "Text": "New the Bitcoin world so just getting my head around it and was hoping someone could let me know if what im thinking is right. \n\nSo based on the original whitepaper Bitcoin is a system of electronic cash that allows for peer to peer payments meaning we dont need paypal for example . Its my understanding that the way paypal works or any trusted third party payment provider works is like below \n\nIn a normal situation where two people wish to send money to each other over the internet they use a trusted third party such as PayPal. The reason that they use a trusted third party is to ensure that the money being transferred is actually transferred and received. If we take the example of Alice sending money to Bob Paypal would credit Alices account of they money and then debit it to Bobs account. PayPal creates a record of this process ensuring the neither party can later claim that payment wasn\u2019t sent or received. If PayPal didn\u2019t exist Alice could tell Bob she issued payment without actually having done so or Bob could claim payment was never received. This allows for Alice to double spend the money she owes or for Bob to request double payment. PayPal acts as an intermediator to the transaction charging a fee for the service of providing payment transfer. \n\nWith Bitcoin payments are peer to peer meaning no trusted third party is used. Instead of paypal confirming transactions and creating a record of payment and receipt this is all done in an automated way with transactions being grouped together to form blocks and blocks being linked together in a sequential chain that can only be added to and once added to cant be altered. \n\nTransactions are confirmed once a block has been created and added to the blockchain. For a block to be created people have to expended computational power looking to solve for a nonce value. The nonce value is a value that gives a blocks header a certain value but im not sure what this value is .\n\nCould someone please explain what a nonce is and tell me if I am on the right track  in terms of paypal versus bitcoin?

From there, they checked the cryptographic statistics and confirmed that from now until now, an unknown operator has poured a little over 198,000 battleships. According to experts, this is one reason why the price of the crypto-wave drops slowly.\n",

I've been wanting to pull the trigger on a large Hawaii Pizza delivery just to have a feel that I'm using my BTC and not just Hodling. But don't want to be THAT pizza guy. That kinda summarize my BTC experience at the moment. Since the value of the BTC is dropping, the amount of pizza I would be able to buy is constantly dropping. FOMO or Pizza?\n\nI don't think that the BTC value of a pizza worth today 15 euro will ever pay me a lambo in the future, but at the same time I just could use fiat to pay the pizza and keep hodling and see what the future bring.",

This is because we are sharing block rewards among all miners in a pool.\n\nUltimately many of them will exit, but only down to a certain sweet spot where the others are incentivized to stay.  After all, if too many exit, then suddenly there's money to be had by joining back in.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the ones that stick it out through the end will be centralized in areas with cheap electricity & no govt regulation, and a lot of the most powerful hardware and largest mining operations.

            "Text": "**Deathbed conversion**\n\nA deathbed conversion is the adoption of a particular religious faith shortly before dying. Making a conversion on one's deathbed may reflect an immediate change of belief, a desire to formalize longer-term beliefs, or a desire to complete a process of conversion already underway. Claims of the deathbed conversion of famous or influential figures have also been used in history as rhetorical devices.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Your win is someone else's loss and vice versa. Just as it's illegal to rig and throw games, it's illegal to wash trade (albeit tough to detect and catch) which is what some of us believe is happening. My friend's gears get grinded when I compare margin trading to gambling, but it's as close as you'll get in the crypto world!  \n\nThere's suspicion that one or more whales saw short positions at recent highs and saw the opportunity to go long instead on Bitfinex and essentially wipe out the shorters, i.e. take their money.",

            "Text": "Thanks for the response I appreciate it.  I currently use armory and for a non techy like me was damn difficult.   I thought electrum was the very similar.  I don't think the kid I'm trying to help has the skills or the spare computers for an offline machine.  He asked me how to buy 10 or 20 quids worth a week so I tried to explain it.  I realised due to his age he's limited to a bitcoin atm.  I hoping it may open his mind a bit and help him save.  I wish I did at that age!  I thought the risk for a few 100 quid at the end of the year a XAPO wallet would suffice.  He can buy at the atm and vault it from his phone. Too young though.  Are there any decent services like XAPO?\n Have to be 18 to have though.",

I'm not.\n\nPeople who short Bitcoin on margin are rooting for that revolution's failure in exchange for some material wealth. I'm just not a fan of that type of person.\n\n",

            "Text": "I spent two days watching the 1m 5m 15m 1h charts and it clicked.  The market oscillates at different frequencies and amplitudes. 20-40 point swings on the 1m chart, 40-100 point swings on the 5m chart, 100-300point swings on the 15 minute chart, 300-500point swings on the 1h chart, 1000-? point swings on the 6h chart.  Whether it swings up or down is dependent on the moving averages on each chart.  On GDax for example the averages are on 12 and 26 point intervals. If the short term moving average on the 1m chart is above the long term then it will push the average higher on the 5m chart.  As long as the short term on the 5m chart is above the long term, the 1 min will rise and dip, almost always recovering, until the moving averages catch up with each other on the 5m chart.  Then the 5m may oscillate back up or jump down.  If it goes down, but the short term moving average remains above the long term on the 15m chart it will recover.  However, if the 5m dive pushes the short term below the long term on the 15m chart it will cause a bigger dive.  Then what happens on the 1 hr chart becomes important because if the short term moving average is above the long term there, the 15m cycle will recover and swing up again.  All the charts interact with each other, and since I figured this out, I\u2019ve predicted every jump and dip (on the 1hr and 6hr charts) and the amplitude of the jumps and dips within a day of them happening.  I think of it as similar to the function of electron orbitals.",

I saw huge liquidations happening as spikes of simultaneous trades covering about .25% to .5% of the asks in the order book each spike, and even more. Some spikes could be huge long positions being opened as well, but I doubt that between 8000 and 8500, in that range it should have been mostly shorts closing and liquidations. \n",
