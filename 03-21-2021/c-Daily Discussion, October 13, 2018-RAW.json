Google and Facebook blocking ads and less msm coverage caused a massive drop in exposure and interest in 2018, which is the only reason the price dropped. Now that google opened up the possibility for ads again, and Facebook did the same, there might be coming more interest again if cryptocompanies spend money on ads. But you have to take human psychology into account also. After ath + crash, it's very unlikely a new ath follows so shortly after it. More likely, sideway movement will continue till after economic recession (end of 2019) and when crypto shows uservalue, which might take a couple of years or might never come.",

You could draw them pointing in the other direction and say we are going to the moon, both would be meaningless.\n\nThings that will move the market:\n- sudden mass adoption of BTC by a country with currency problems, eg increased demand.\n- an ETF approval AND a desire to buy BTC by institutions, eg increased demand.\n- whales doing their thing with big selloffs, eg increased supply.\n- miners doing their thing dumping huge amounts of coin on the market to cash out before another miner dumps theirs, eg increased supply.\n- new technology that solves an actual problem, eg increased demand.\n- slow and steady organic growth based on meeting a market need like Store of Value or fast cheap international payments, eg increased demand.\n\nArbitrary lines on a graph don\u2019t predict this stuff.
