            "Text": "This message is mainly for the newbs here, but if you are feeling queasy right now about your investment in Bitcoin maybe this will help you too:\n\nBitcoin (and Blockchain) is a truly beautiful innovation that is here to stay.  If you feel nervous about the price volatility at this early stage of development, I encourage you to read some of the first e-mails by the creator of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto and the reaction from his e-mail group:\n\nhttps://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html\n\n\nHere is the original white-paper:\n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\n\nAt times I get nervous too when I look at the price, as I have a lot invested in bitcoin.  At these times it is very reassuring to read these early writings on bitcoin and it reminds me why I'm invested.  \n\n\nAnother thing that helps is to watch some youtube videos by the Winklevoss twins. They have been true believers in bitcoin almost since the beginning and believe the price could eventually get to over 300,000 per coin (marketshare of gold).  There are others like John Mcafee that believe it could easily get to 1 million per coin by end of 2020.   Even if it only gets to 100k by then that's still 10x your money today!  And by holding bitcoin longterm you are helping this amazing system (based on pure math) succeed.  It could really change the world and you could be a part of it.  Think of this before you panic sell in the future.  \n\n\nTo repeat my earlier advice, follow my lead and get some money ready on the side to buy any significant drops caused by the Mt Gox guy dumping.  You will thank me later if you buy when you can and hold long term.  All the best to my fellow hodlers.  ",

            "Text": "I think it's safe to conclude that the recent crash has been far less severe, judging from objective factors, compared with the crash from ATH in December towards the final valley and bounce at 6th of February. This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.\n\nhttps://coinstelegram.com/2018/03/10/the-next-court-proceeding-for-mt-gox-bankruptsy-is-postponed-until-september-2018/\n\n(Credit to FlorianManner for posting the link here)\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.\n\nOn the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming week. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.\n\nThe question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.\n\nIf the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.\n\nThis is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.",

Whatever ideas Satoshi had, and they were mostly naive (except for the technical part), bitcoin has evolved into a token for greedy speculation, gambling, scams, and assorted criminality.

            "Text": "Imagine if there is a price difference between two exchanges, and you happen to have an account on both. You would buy some BTC on the cheaper exchange and immediately sell it on the more expensive exchange (you need to have a pool of funds and BTC on both exchanges for this to work). For you, instant money.  The cheaper exchange sees increase in demand, and puts its price a bit higher, the more expensive exchange sees an increase in supply, and drops it price a bit. Rinse and repeat till there is no more profit to be made.\n\nNow imagine thousands of people trying to accomplish this, the price on all exchanges will be organically the same. Any change in prices will be exploited, either by the exchange owners or its members, so no change can exist in a dynamic equilibrium.\n\nNote, this only works for open and free and honest exchanges, if an exchange has very strict limitations on who can join, and with which currency it can work, or what the maximal trade is... there are extra factors in play which will account for the difference.",

First, until the moon comes, funds are locked which can be used to profit elsewhere.  Second, the moon may never come and hodlers will be the ones holding the bucket if it crashes.  \n\nSo, make your own decision on whether the 10-15% gain/loss per day is good.  Or if you want to hodl till it reaches 100x (or whatever is the fantasy number).\n\n",

            "Text": "IMO for a crypto asset to be worthwhile for investment it needs two things:\n\n1. It needs to offer some unique utility that would make people want to buy it for other reasons than just investing.\n\n2. It needs a robust and decentralized structure, because if it's centralized in governance or distribution then this probably invalidates its utility as the same thing could be done more efficiently and faster with a normal database-based program. What makes crypto useful is that it is permissionless and trustless, and centralized systems are by nature none of these.\n\nTo find out whether an asset meets these criteria, you need to do you own research. There's a lot of misinformation going around, so be skeptical. Reading the whitepaper is usually the best way, even if it is long and technical.",

A week from now I expect the price will gravitate towards $10k-$11k, which is where the market supply and demand seem to strike a convincing balance as long as there is no fear of an immediate crash. I could certainly be wrong but that's how I read the market at the moment. Considering the amount of uncertainty in the market after the crash, it is hard to say anything with certainty. I think at the end of the day, the long term projections will guide the price discovery, in spite of fears.",

It looks like it is you who is seeking to salve your fears. \n\nWant proof?  Do you even understand how the technology works? As in, what the invention actually is?  Don't you think it is strange that you have invested so much of your time, and yet you still haven't even grasped why it works?   It is the greatest financial technology since the [Medici family/bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medici_Bank) implemented double entry bookkeeping over 500 years ago. Just like that double entry bookkeeping invention, it does not require the understanding of people to benefit from it, or indeed be sucked into it.  Like banking, it feeds on peoples insecurity with money and therefore their futures. \n\nAnd people always fear what they don't understand.",

Zoom out of the mid market price and you\u2019ll see that volume clearly is in favor of the buyers. Buyers at the time aren\u2019t eager to buy at the moment but are setting the price on the exchanges and are waiting for it to come to them. Sellers are playing out and whats left are the remnants of the Mt Gox terd stain, Government seizures (which are a concern as they\u2019ll auction off at some point) and the bullshit FUD that goes around because these shortsellers are getting rekd and on the 30day chart it looks to me like a inverse head and shoulders pattern. But I never claim to be 100% accurate as I could be wrong its Bitcoin it\u2019s decentralized and it doesn\u2019t give a fuck about me or anyone else ",

I gave you every period of time where holding has made money (consistency) which I have done. Show me where you have done even nearly as well trading and I will concede the point. There actually is evidence for Bitcoin to increase, its called historical data. Now try to argue that we don't know tomorrow will happen either since there is no \"evidence\" to support it other than it happening for the past 4 billion years. I did NOT say that Bitcoin is guaranteed to increase which you are representing is my position my good strawman. What I said was Holding HAS BEEN the most consistent way to make money in Bitcoin. Prove me wrong with your trades that approach my returns.\n\nI dont know if you live on the East coast young man but if you do its getting kind of late. Its night night time.
