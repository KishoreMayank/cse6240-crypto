The greed is real and so is the manipulation but once the volume kicks in, the manipulation gets wrecked. \n\nWhich is why ETFs will be good, not bad for Bitcoin. An ETF could place a big demand on a limited supply and improve public perception of legitimacy. The doors for market manipulation were already opened with futures but at least ETFs will start a domino effect of incoming Money to the space.",

Think of it as an auction but in reverse. And the people who are shorting are just betting the price is going to continue to go lower than what they put their order in at. But it also work the other way, when someone buys btc and they want to sell for a profit they sell higher than the next person, and if someone thinks the price is going to continue to rise they go long.",

If the price goes down you can buy back the Bitcoin you borrowed and keep the difference. If the price goes up when you have to give the Bitcoin back you will be paying more for it out of pocket\n\nWhen you hear about people getting liquidated it would go something like this. If they deposit $500 worth of bitcoin and initiate a short position. Bitcoin then turns around and Rises $500. They just lost their entire sum\n\nFutures are different but a lot of people don't use those because they require more money to open an account. The future is follow the price action of the underlying coin. ",

The people who Short believes that the price will go down (but doesn't mean it will).  And people who buy Long believes that the price will go up (but again, doesn't mean it will).",

            "Text": "Nope.  \n\nETF will AMPLIFY the effect and not necessarily in a positive way. \n Don't forget ETFs will provide a new route to short BTC.\n\nAnd it all depends on whether it's cash-based or synthetic/derivative.  If it's cash-based, the amount of BTC available for trade does not change.  If it's derivative, then it's building a bubble on top of another bubble.\n\nIn both situations, it's not good for BTC.  It's only good for the ETF fund manager and they are giving us new ropes to hang ourselves.\n\nWorst case scenario?  Leveraged ETFs used to short BTC in an unregulated market.  In this scenario, ZERO cash flows into BTC.  Instead, manipulators will take leveraged ETF shorts and then work with the exchanges to force the price down by sharing the spoils with them.",

It removes the risk and the worry of buying it, storing and securing it. The first step to Bitcoin growth, whether it be as an investment or as a currency, is removing the obstacle of technical confidence required to obtain it.\nI've only invested modestly, but have been following this shit for years. The snowball effect of ETFs, and the statement of Bitcoin legitimacy it makes, could very easily ramp up the volume in a short time. All these details you are talk about in terms of how ETFs enable manipulation will be mute. The ability to manipulate diminishes with every increase in the number of players in the game.\nLook at the whole playing board, not just the rules of one single square.",

Until the regulators bring this under control, it is just giving manipulators another tool.  \n\nTell me what good does ETF, or for that matter, all these speculation tools like exchanges and futures do for BTC?  NOTHING.  \n\nIt just encourages speculation and if you take a good look at the larger picture, is KILLING BTC.\n\nUnderstand this simple principle - Value is determined by the accepting party.  Right now, with little adoption by merchants, BTC is worth $0 on anywhere other than exchanges.  When it's widely adopted, that changes as goods and services are PRICED using BTC.  That's when BTC has real Value beyond exchanges and other trading platforms.\n\n",

This will not only encourage new investors by easing investment but also capital flows back into BTC.  I.e. High volume of ETF purchases translate into high volume of BTC purchases by ETF managers.\n\nThis will then lay down the foundation for institutional investors to seriously consider putting in large amount of capital into BTC.",
