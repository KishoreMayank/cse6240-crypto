In this case, the probability of a move higher towards pennant resistance of $8,880 would rise sharply.\n\nBearish scenario: BTC could drop to pennant support at $7,080 if the bulls fail to capitalize on the positive setup seen in the daily chart and prices drop below $7,372 (June 5 low).\n\nA weekly close below$7,080 (downside break of the pennant pattern) could yield a sell-off below $6,000 (February low).",

There is no other way around than longterm rising value of bitcoin. Buy low, sell high. Just wait for the next financial crysis to come to see how bitcoin will react... Buy low, when high, take out everything you have put in, but leave the profit inside. This way you accumulate bitcoin and you will not have anything in \"The Game\" - did you lost?",

So these nodes then pick some transactions from a pool including mine and start mining. So it is possible that 2 miners work on the same transaction at the same time right? So in the end there might be 2 blocks which contain the same transaction. What mechanism prevents them to append both blocks to the chain?",

Pizza is a rare delicacy being cooked only at this place and is all the craze at the moment, people and are paying good money to buy pizza from this pizza place:\n\n\\- 4 people cook the pizza and 10 minutes later they divide it amongst each other. Every cook get 1/4 of a whole pizza (say they are a pool of 100&#37; of the network for simplicity sake). Everyone find it fair because the 10 minutes of work was worth 1/4 of a pizza. You think this is a sweet job and invest a good chunk of your savings to move to another city and start baking pizza because it pays so well. ( This is an analogy to BTC mining being profitable for you for a specific hardware at today's difficulty of the network. So you think you'll be printing money and splurdge your saving into a sweet Bitmain S9 \\+ Power supply).\n\n\\- 8 people cook the pizza, the pizza will not come in 5 minutes because the oven is magic and can't give you pizza any faster because you're more at the task, everyone get 1/8 of the pizza. Everyone still find it fair if 1/8 of pizza is still worth 10 minutes of labor. (This is an analogy of you being now a miner, and as time goes by you see your mining profit dwindling away and the cost of having purchased the ASIC is now looking like a foolish attempt to get rich quick).\n\n\\- 16 people cook the pizza, again the oven is magic and 10 minutes later the pizza come and has to be shared. now let's say 1/16 of a pizza doesn't justify working there anymore. And there is so many people with your skillset on the job market no one wants to hire you for a similar position (this is an analogy of your sweet Bitmain S9 having now the value of a paperweight sometimes in the future).\n\n\\- People having the skillset to bake pizza are easily found in the market and some accept a smaller wage than you. (This is an analogy to other people having access to electricity at cheap rate VS your cost of electricity)\n\nAlternative endings (combo are possible):\n\n\\- You are fired of the pizza place. you're out of a job. (This is an analogy of your sweet Bitmain S9 being defective for some reasons and out of warranty and is now a paperweight).\n\n\\- The pizza place isn't a regulated industry and other business are opening in all corners of the city and are selling ersatz of your rare pizza. (This is an analogy of new altcoins poping up everyday and diluting the value of the crypto market).\n\n\\- Everyone is tired of eating pizza at so many different places and the price of the pizza is going down.(This is an analogy to the loss of interest in crypto as it isn't perceived as anything else than speculation at the moment by the large public).\n\nIf you consider being a miner, do not only consider if you'll be \"profitable\" at the:\n\n\\- present cost of electricity.\n\n\\- present difficulty of the network.\n\n\\- present value of the BTC.\n\nBut also what when your profit marging will be enough to even out the purchase of the hardware.\n\ntry to factor in your labor time (but you can write it off if you consider this a fun hobby).\n\nIs BTC mining profitable at the moment?\n\nI don't think so unless your electricity is damn cheap or free.\n\nAlso, do not HODL too much, sometimes you have to take a profit, don't be a bagholder.",

The problem is that you'll be competing with people with lower cost of operation and with better gear quality. And soon your firepower won't be profitable anymore and I wish you to have recoup your investment by then because profitability doesn't go up on the long term, it only goes down.\n\nWhat you have as a hobby miner against larger setup is: \n\n\\- Cost of airconditionning. Having a smaller enough setup will not need air conditionning.\n\n\\- Cost of labor. you'll be the one maintaining the rig operation (cleaning and supervision).\n\n\\- Cost of real Estate. Large operation have to justify the cost of the large place they are renting. You on the other hand only have to find a small place for your small operation.\n\n\\- Being able to wait for your profit. You could take your mined BTC and put them on a regular basis at a limit sell order a bit higher than the market price of the day you mined it. This would be a way to squeeze a few &#37; of profitability. But don't be a bagholder. Large operation have to pay rent and huge cost of electricity. They have to cash out on a regular basis, you don't (unless you're going in debt for your mining operation but then I would advise against doing it).\n\nYou have to keep your operation small unless you want to end up with those costs as well.",

We need lightning network to somehow fix that, but in btc's current state it is essentially useless when being used as a currency. Not to mention the total waste of electricity that could be easily solved by using the consesus algorithm instead. BTC will never be mass adopted, it is outdated tech.. Now the question remains; will it become the new standard for digitized gold and used as a store of value? It may, it may not, but I sure hope btc will thrive in value regardless.",

Any time you want more bandwidth you're going to have to sacrifice on security in some form; however, with lightning network, individuals can indeed handle thousands of TX/s rather easily and it doesn't require putting the entire base chain at risk.",

I saw this same shit 20 years ago with Java,  everyone thought they could somehow invest in Java,  because it was gonna take over the world,  and become the ONE language.\n\nNow Java did actually gain an amazing mind share,  and is now ubiquitous,  but nobody that ever invested in a Java pure play ever made money.",
