I saw that there was a systematic FUD campign going on r/cryptocurrency, r/bitcoin and to lesser extent top 10 coin subs.\n\nThe typical poster profile was:\n\n1. High karma (1 000-5 000 minimum up to 100 000)\n\n2. Same fud link/\"concern\" posted at the same time on several subs\n\n3. About 3/5 had no history in cryptcurrency subredits themes (ie not community active or coin-affiliated)\n\nMy question is, (directed mainly to high karma redditors) - have any of you been approached by persons/organisations asking you to post certain themed article links, \"market concerns\", (ie propagating doom/bearish atmosphere to facilitate market drop) in return for material goods/crypto/fiat?\n\nAlso, what are community concerns about this issues, have any of you fellow redditors made similar observations?\n\nKind regards, cheers!\n\n",

Until now I've just kept it as an investment, but the more I read about the technology the more I want to use some of it as an actual currency.\n\nI've looked up a site called coinmap and found a coffee shop in my town that accepts bitcoin, but what's the process of actually performing a transaction? I'm guessing I'd need a wallet on my phone for easy access, but other than that and being able to say \"hi I'd like a flat white, a slice of that cake, and to pay in bitcoin please\" I'm not sure what I'd actually have to do.",

(Too many miners for a limited pool of coins? Drop of profit that would drive down the interest for mining? AMD/Nvidia ramping up the production above the demands to drive down the prices...)\n\nI'm looking to get a new GPU soon, but the high prices are pushing me away. I paid 200$ (years ago) for what was a mid-tier GPU at the time (R9 290). It seems like anything in the mid-tier are above 400$ at the moment... \n\nIf I can trust the news/Reddit, I believe there have been some ups and downs in the crypto world (crashes?), yet there have been little to no effect on the GPU market (used and new).\n\nI would greatly appreciate if you could help me a little understand the Mining world and its impact on the GPU :)\n\nThanks.",

            "Text": "Each trade is a discrete event that is tax liable.  The tricky part is determining which part of your stack you sold, and the cost basis of the exact coins you traded. You do get to choose FIFO or LIFO, but you must be consistent forever.  If you sell your whole stack at a time, it doesn't matter.  The first trade would be a gain of 1k, the second a gain of 500, the third a loss of 500, the fourth a loss of 1k.  Even though the percentile gains and losses are different, the monetary balance nets zero.  As long as you were using your entire stack, and not using some long term gains and some short term gains, I believe your net tax burden would be zero, because you get tax credit for the losses.  You would still have to declare every trade, of course.",

The Dow Jones chart upwards trend at 4h intervals is looking great in my opinion.\n\nIn addition, in many European countries wages are paid this week which increases the overall purchase power. Since December it appears that Wednesday to early Saturday tend to give positive trends for BTC.\n\nWhile there is always a risk for another dip towards $8K-$9K due to larger BTC speculators selling on their short-term cycle, I am generally positive for this week. 12K will definitely be an interesting point, especially since it offers a doubling of value for those that bought in at 6K just short of two weeks ago.",

            "Text": "Wash trading is someone selling/buying to himself (or a smaller number of participants acting together). Selling/buying within an exchange is not wash trading. \n\nAnother thing.. Someone might buy 10000 bitcoins and transfer them from an exchange to his own wallet and that would be 1 tx only. \n\nMempool clearing is much more evidence of someone \"spamming\" needless TXs than evidence of wash trading on exchanges. \n\n\n",

I assume it is because people put all cryptocurrencies into one box without acknowledging the differences.

E.g., if BTC/USD tanks, it becomes cheaper to buy an alt using BTC on these exchanges.  This puts pressure on alt/USD and arbitrage starts between alt/BTC and alt/USD till there's a new market acceptance of the two pairs.\n\nBecause most exchanges offer trading pairs between most of the cryptos, they are now somewhat interlinked whether we like it or not since arbitrage will always even things out.  So entire cryptos rise and fall together more often than not.  And because BTC owns the lion's share of the crypto market cap, it's influence over the alts is much higher.",

            "Text": "This is where it can get complex.  You have to determine how long you plan to hold each purchased coin on average, and also how much of your stack you will be trading at once.  If its all your stack frequently, then you'll always be in the STCG bracket.  If you plan on only trading with a portion of your stack after a few months, there's more to consider, and you might qualify for LTCG.  \n\nLets say you have held your coins for an average of 10 months, some more and some less.  If you wish to sell a portion in expectation of a future dip, or just profit taking, then you'd be better off selling only those that you've owned for longer than 1 year, because you'd pay less tax on the gains.  You'd have to choose First in First Out, and you'd be selling the coins you've held the longest.  It depends how convinced you are of future events, to be honest.  But if you've bought a lot about 5 months ago and have been adding little amounts since then, LIFO* might be better, because its a big deal to get that batch to the lesser rate.  You're going to have to crunch the numbers yourself.  \n\nIts always a good idea to set aside an estimate of your tax burden before buying back in.  If you reinvest everything, you're going to be on the hook for money you might not have.  \n\n*edit",

            "Text": "Tax applies to every sale or crypto to crypto trade.  Whether gains or losses, at the end of the year you have two piles of trades, those in which the underlying was held for \\< 1 year, and those that the underlying was held for \\> 1 year.  These are two different taxation rates.  You add up the trades from each pile and get a net result, and multiply each by the respective tax rate.  The short term is your current federal tax bracket, the long term is 15&#37; I believe.  \n\nIts in your best interest to make trades based on maximizing the amount of LTCG trades.  You can choose which format you'll be taxed under, First in First out, or Last in First out.  You just have to be consistent or you'll be in for a world of hurt.  ",
