It talks about death spirals, 51% attacks, miner capitulation, and generally predicts imminent doom and gloom for bitcoin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Note that it was written nearly 4 years ago**, about one year into the last bear market that lasted ~2 years.  We all know what happened after.  2016-2017 would bring an impressive bull market that caught the attention of the mainstream media and some in the general public.  It\u2019s almost like the article could have been written today if you just add a zero to the end of the bitcoin prices referenced. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo with the current crop of bitcoin critics that pop up in every bear market, sooner or later they need to ask themselves, why do they keep getting it so wrong?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLong live the King of Crypto.  \ud83e\udd34\ud83c\udffb Long live bitcoin! \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The End Of Bitcoin**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> You could fill a book with the flaws of Bitcoin and why it will never take off. Its had its 15 minutes of fame and now **everyone has moved on.** The community is shrinking and growing more desperate in its attempts to pretend everything is fine. Currencies rely heavily on network effects to survive, if no one else uses one then there\u2019s no sense in you using it. **The Bitcoin network is fading away and the price is destined to continue its downward march. This is likely to be the last year people take Bitcoin seriously (if last year wasn\u2019t already).** Whether Bitcoin disappears with a bang or a whimper, the end is coming.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://whistlinginthewind.org/2015/02/05/the-end-of-bitcoin/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[- Hopium Time Archives -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8zqex8/hopium_time_and_my_bitcoin_bet/) ",

Now such whales are very far and few. Why? Because the massive price cycles have caused redistribution of coins among a wider swath of people through a combination of profit booking and panic selling. \n\nIt is the more thinly spread out BTC that enables a much higher price to be easily sustained now than say in 2015 or 2012. There is every reason for the same trend of distribution thinning out to continue and thus support higher prices in future. \n\nThis is also the reason why you do not have to find one person to buy your stash at higher price in future - something that many call Greater Fool theory. That only applies to indivisible objects. The mechanism that supports higher BTC price is entirely different and is supported by the money like infinitely divisible feature. ",

There are rules.  But I am known for my magnanimity.\n\nSadly, Bcash is sinking, and is now under the bottom 4% of its little tank.  Miggins thinks it is dead.

And Mr Ver, the bank manager, claims it is merely sleeping.\n\nAnyway, far too much drama here.  I asked Nursey if I had reached the bottom.

            "Text": "We had a huge drop in difficulty with this latest adjustment. What would happen if all the hash power came back once the difficulty was decreased but leave again when difficulty goes up without the price of bitcoin moving? Wouldn't that create super long blocks for the following weeks since those miners would then be gone? \n\nI'm wondering if huge miners buy and sell in huge blocks in order to drive the market like the FED does to curb or increase inflation. I would assume if this was the case the price would bounce upwards over the next two weeks up to the next adjustment. Thoughts? Maybe I'm missing something since I'm no expert. ",

You tell them and they say that worn out line about \"the past performance is not indicative of future results\", which is stupid because they're literally repeating past in every word they say. On top of that, the PAST has become more a part of our analyzing future than it ever has in history. Big data, charts, analysis, search trends, website analytics, literally every technical analysis we make is based on the past. Well, when it comes to Bitcoin, the past has shown us that this thing is just getting started.  ",

It has utility and it has defences of a subtle but powerful nature that use human behaviour to propagate itself.

I believe we are now either at the bottom or near the very bottom. I could not see Bitcoin falling below $2100 and I was advising everyone that $6K was not the bottom. Everybody called me FUD. But I won big because I stood behind my beliefs based on historical behavior of Bitcoin. I do believe that if Bitcoin falls again, it will be its final fall. In the longterm, even buying $6K will be very rewarding when Bitcoin hits $190K. When institutional money finally touches Bitcoin or an ETF gets passed, sky is the limit. Bitcoin has actually done phenomenally well considering institutional money has not touched BTC yet albeit all the whale pumping. The global wealth is roughly estimated at $200 trillion and not even a trillion has hit the cryptocurrency market yet let alone Bitcoin. This is the longterm progression that Bitcoin is making. Patience is key.",

Be a collectible. Humans like to collect things. Sea shells are an example. People collect them because they find it interesting.\n\n2. Be a store of value. Sea shells take time to collect and they can only be collected by the coasts. People would use this to store their time collecting the shells as value.\n\n3. Be a medium of exchange. Once the sea shells store value, people use it to trade their value for other goods or services. Because they store value, other people will accept them for their goods and services.\n\n4. Be a unit of account. People start pricing items in terms of sea shells. A load of bread is 5 shells, a haircut costs 5 shells. Maybe you have a loaf of bread and need a haircut, but your barber doesn't need a loaf of bread, by being a unit of account, you can exchange that value.",

Bitcoin is not a product. It's not a share of any company. It's not real estate. There is no owner, and no marketing department. It's a global accounting system, self maintained by it's mechanics of participants, security of math, and redundancy & decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nIt's a placeholder, just like any other placeholder  in the history of currency. If people choose to store their value in this new currency then it will scale in value accordingly. After only 10 short years it's come from a tiny project and valued by participants at only pennies to being sold for thousands. As a society we're still in the early stages of discovering what the value will be, but we have generations to go. As long as people hold your perspective and try to value it like real estate or a car, then we have a ways to go.",

In that case, it's much more likely for them to rebuy in at just below $10k, so that would leave them about 0.76 bitcoins if they re-invested half their profits, and the rest likely went towards quitting their job to roll in cash for a while, so now they have little left to buy more and could even be thinking about selling to make ends meet.

The whole concept is irrelevant because it's become the foundation for any investment that's over valued and these days, and that covers a hell of a lot of ground. Bitcoin will hold a value proportionate to the amount of value people choose to store on its blockchain.\n\nIf the number of people injecting money into bitcoin continues to increase at a pace similar to the past decade, then in another decade it will be worth far more, based on a fixed supply. It's like a bank account - it's just a placeholder and for that reason many like to argue it has no intrinsic value . Well sooner or later people will start to understand that the value lies in the potential of the accounting efficiency, and not in the actual bitcoin. It's difficult for people constrained within the mindset of traditional stocks to grasp this concept of a hybrid entity, but I think we've come a long way in a short ten years.",

So it actually becomes the best play to not even get the airdrop, but sell before it.\n\nThe same thing, but opposite will happen at this estimated 3k floor.",

            "Text": "I don't think the top scenario could play out too dramatically. There is a gradual gradient in the profit points of different mining operators, some who switched off (or even still mining), still may not make a profit now (note the current estimate for the next adjustment is still negative) and so can't re-enter yet (or will have to leave), for others they may be back in the green and so will jump back in. The marginal ones will have to stop again if the difficulty goes back up too much but it won't be a dramatic fraction and the rest will keep going. The process would continue until equilibrium is reached.\n\nKeep in mind as well that there is a maximum difficulty adjustment, so you can't jump from a situation where all miners are profitable to where all miners are not profitable.\n\nminers who are not profitable now, may indeed hold on to more bitcoin to sell later, if they think the price can rise again and provided they can cover their costs.",

Obviously the economy has been great the past 10 years and is at its own all time highs...and Bitcoin is yet to be tested during a good recession. Surely a recession could fall Bitcoin even further but I genuinely believe it won\u2019t have too much of an impact considering where we are today. Dow Jones fell 900 pts and I predict this will be followed by a massive 5700-point drop in one day occurring some time in 2019 commencing the process of a recession. Right now it is much better to have your money in Bitcoin than the stock market because the stock market has much more to fall than BTC potentially does. In all honesty, I think cash reserves is your best bet until early 2020. ",

It doesn't change the fact that bitcoin provides superior accounting. It represents the value being held in it collectively and if masive selling occurs then the price will drop.

If that happened again, I'm sure everyone today would still be against unlimited bitcoin.\n\n>And > 50% miners can block whatever transactions they want.\n\nThis is currently very costly to do (look at the recent failed attempt on BCH, who's network is much smaller), and would result in the miners losing their source of income (due to plummet in price) making all the mining equipment needed for a 51% attack useless.",

I realise this was a big part in the recent explosion. \n\nI emphasise though, that no matter what those people are doing, there is a growing number of others who value it for the freedom it gives them. There was a healthy dark market working perfectly fine with <$10 bitcoin before most of us here even found out about it. They wanted to do things they otherwise couldn't with any other medium of exchange, no matter how fast and sleek the fiat transactions were. \n\nWe will have many ups and downs through speculations, but the eventual price will ultimately depend on how many people want the freedom of an immutable, decentralised currency which cannot be taken away from them, and which can't be manipulated through inflation of supply. I hope eventually enough people will realise how much they are being controlled to challenge the fiat system, but only time will tell. ",
