This process goes on until the growth gets completely unsustainable; and then repeats this process in reverse.\n\nAs Bitcoin grows in marketcap, trade volume, and various financial products; it will stabilize the volatility. However it is a slow and gradual process; I wouldn't expect \"low volatility Bitcoin\" for another 10-15 years.",
