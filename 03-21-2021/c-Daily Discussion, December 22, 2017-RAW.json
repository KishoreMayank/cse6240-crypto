Speaking from experience here back when we were swinging around 1000.\n\nFACT: BTC is only worth what people think it's worth, it currently has 0 actual value, it can't be used as a regular currency. By investing in it you're betting on the devs and community to figure out segwit, lightening and other solutions to make it a success. Maybe instead of bitching about stuff you could go educate yourself on how to solve these issues and help.\n\n\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",

            "Text": "I'm writing this to highlight some problems with bitcoin which a lot of people either overlook or simply do not know. This is strictly from a financial perspective. I do not wish to make any judgements on its technology.\n\n1) General lack of responsibility from the exchanges. As much as btc believers love the fact that btc is separated from government, they should realize that when evaluating currency these exchanges should be judged (in a sense) as the entity behind it, as they have the most oversight and influence in transactions. This is significant and institutions will not forget it like many of us have here.\n\n2) The lack of utility is shocking. This dip would be one thing if btc buyers were regularly using their coins for day to day sort of things, as they would see the value in it and not want to give it up. The problem is that btc's most valuable use is converting it back to fiat. Not a super attractive currency, but because it's a fad it's trading at 13000 usd per coin. That's absurd. The fact that almost everyone bought this with its value in fiat in mind knowing that it had no use other than that means that a dip could spell massive sell off ripples.\n\n3) Volatility is a problem. No firm will adopt btc because of this. If a firm had received payment of 1 btc last week for a service they would've lost nearly 1/3 of its value by now. This seems to be a really obvious problem to its longevity yet most people say \"it goes up, it goes down. Deal with it.\" Businesses will not deal with this, and they have very good reason not to. And then there's the people who love the volatility and see coins as financial instruments. What kind of asset is this exactly? It has no underlying, it just moves so much because of this fad. It's not gold either, gold has an established value and is supposed to protect from volatile markets.\n\nAll these problems aren't just any problems, they're essential to the definition of a currency. This leads me to think it is a bubble. Many bubbles are created when fads arise among the populous who can't properly assess the fundamentals. As much as you may distrust financial institutions they really do understand better than anyone how to value securities. This price drive has had zero institutional oversight or analysis. If any other currency displayed such high trans fees, poor oversight, lack of utility, or instability it would be trading at a lesser value than the yen. This doesn't have to mean that btc or crypto is over forever, just like the dot com bubble wasn't the end of the internet. Highlighting these problems just sheds light on the needs of the crypto market. Competition will step in and trans fees will lower and prices could stabilize. It's too early for btc to even be in the thousands in my eyes.",

            "Text": "**Crypto Currency Liquidity Crisis Explained:**\n\nCoinbase and other exchanges fragmented bitcoins into millions of small uotxs [1], likely to increase fee charges, by sending small crumbs to fulfill a TX.  However, now that mempool is full it costs exchanges more to aggregate the small uotxs crumbs to fulfill your TXs then the cost of creating the crumbs.\n\nTherefore, exchanges will try to delay TXs, until the transaction fees go down, unless they lose out money on every TXs.\n\nAs the mempool continues to be congested more fragmented txs become dangling crumbs (costing exchanges more to fulfill then the cost of creating the fragmentation).\n\nThis is causing a liquidity crisis as\nMore reserves (Euros and USD) on exchanges are diverted to meet existing tx obligations.  A workaround is to delay txs in the hopes the mempool clears, and transaction fees lower, but as the mempool continues to congest, **the liquidity crisis is becoming a solvency crisis for all exchanges**, since every transaction is costing them more than creating the fragmented crumbs.\n\n**This is a design flaw in the market structure of exchanges**, and the current bitcoin protocol.\n\nIt can happen again in the future.\n\n[1]https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lhmeo/another_coinbase_problem_because_of_the/?st=JBI061RR&sh=4f33e0d0",

Maybe watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSRN8PUhHX0 to remind yourself that we aren't here to make a quick buck for some random amateur traders but we are about something much much bigger. Bitcoin is radically disruptive and you are part of the revolution. We are challenging the very notions of what money is and how trust works. Rest assured that bitcoin isn't going away. \n\nIt was blatantly obvious weeks and weeks ago that this correction is coming. Raise your hand if you did not hear at least two hundred times in the last three weeks that this bubble will burst! No one? Exactly.\n\nUnfortunately the people who are really freaking out are the people who jumped on the get rich quick bandwagon without knowing much about bitcoin or crypto. Guys, BTC was around 5k in October. If you were in it before the real hype choo choo, you are still totally ok. Still 100%+ (!!!) up from only just THREE months ago. I won't even talk about years. This is a very expensive lesson for a lot of people and I am sorry the excitement and the promise of quick riches got you into this mess. Maybe you can pivot now, in your head, and let the excitement for the tech carry you forward because really that is what matters here.",

If you're on an exchange like Bittrex, and you're day trading BTC -> Alt -> BTC -> Alt etc, all of those transactions are taxable if you profit. Not just if you pull out to USD in the end? My friend said\n\n> Yeah, but there is no regulation in crypto currency yet. They only know if you withdrawal. Binance doesn\u2019t even require ID to sign up\n\nI'm just trying to do what's right and make sure he and myself don't get screwed over come tax season.\n\nTL;DR If I day trade BTC -> Alt -> BTC, but don't cash out to USD/fiat for over a year, are the trades taxable as a short term capital gains or long term capital gains? And I am talking US Tax laws.",

Here is a screenshot of some recent order activity:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/R4BMh\n\nThe Bcash supporters will probably come on and say this is natural market activity, and everyone just wants to buy, but if someone really was looking to accumulate a lot of BCH, they would be smarter and use limit buys rather than market buys that keep driving up the price. \n\nThis looks to me like someone with deep pockets is trying to keep the ratio from falling. \n\nSadly, the only way to prove this theory would be to try to make the bid/ask spread really far apart. Like if someone were to place a huge market sell and bring the highest bid down to 0.170 but keep the ask at 0.190 and see if the coins at 0.190 still get bought up (despite the fact that people are willing to sell for much cheaper). I am almost certain that they would be.\n\nIf I had to guess I would say that the same thing is happening on GDAX too. This is the best explanation I can come up with as to why the BCH price is staying so strong.\n\nI guess we will have to hope that eventually whoever is doing this will run out of money so the market can speak for itself.",

I put the remaining two into 2 BTC into 2 paper wallets and forgot about them in a safe box with my personal papers.\n\nRecently, I freaked out when I heard my 2 BTC were worth almost 40k and panic-bought a TREZOR for $150. I bought $100 worth of bitcoin to test out my TREZOR and cover transfer fees... but that's not even enough to cover transfer fees of moving my 2 BTC to TREZOR ($30 worth of bitcoin transfer fee x 4). >.>  And then Bitcoin corrects. I feel bad spending USD my magic internet money because everyone is telling me to cash out and I can't say \"I've already cashed out\" if I'm investing in bitcoin hobby stuff. \n\nI got some stainless steel nameplates ($9) and a letter press punch set ($20) to copy down my TREZOR BIP24 passphrases as a poor-man's cryptosteel (~$200). I was going to put those in a safe deposit box at a bank (~$10-15/mo) once Bitcoin hit $25K since I don't trust my parents. But now it's correcting so I still have time to take care of that. If someone gets a hold of my recovery password for TREZOR, they get all my money, right? Or do the password-protected wallets guard against that?\n\nI guess part of me is like, \"Why is this costing so much? In my day a BTC was only $40, hurr.\" I don't want to waste my money--even buying a hardware wallet seemed like a splurge.",

I've been following coinmarketcap the past few days and am aware of today's dip and recovery so he's not telling me anything I don't know.  \n\nI don't know why my dad is so against BTC (it's not like I try to convince him to buy, in fact I hadn't talked about it to him since Nov 2013-Jan 2014), he just brings it up thanks to our local newspaper and the news sites he's subscribed to publish eye catching headlines.   After reading the BBC news headline, he proudly announced that there's no way he's going to invest in something that could be worth $20k one week and $10k the next.  Every time there's \"bad\" news from mainstream media criticizing bitcoin he tells me about it in a \"I told you so\" sort of way. Then when I countered how in the beginning of the year it was under $1000 and peaked to near $20,000, that the market cap for all coins combined was over $650B, he says, is that it?  He apparently misheard me and thought I said $650M.   He then went on to say so what, neither you nor I invested a year ago, so it's not important. \n\nFrankly I'm fed up of having dad keep trolling me about BTC's \"flaws\" and volatility.  Any advice on how to respond?  Maybe I should just leave the room when he gets on his soapbox?",

If I had to guess I'd say we will see a $15,000 print again by mid-January.\n\nThe bad news, is that (in my opinion) the BTC chart is broken, for a lack of better words...again my opinion, but I do not think $19,000 will be revisited for a very long time, perhaps never. Keep in my mind I am just some rando on the internet, but if you look at most parabolic charts throughout history (silver in 2011 for example) they confirm what I am talking about.",

These are a few thoughts after waking up to this a month ago or however long that was.\n\nI\u2019ve realized a lot of people are buying and they don\u2019t know what they are  buying or buying into so I\u2019m trying to figure it out for myself and have it make sense. \n\nWhat if Bitcoin and it\u2019s lack of a central company running it and it sticking to exactly what you can count on (rules) without human manipulation become (maybe already is) what is most appealing about Bitcoin long term? It\u2019s security and reputation.  Maybe it\u2019s not. Love to read other thoughtful opinions. \n\nAt this moment it can\u2019t be spent on anything really so if you cash out there\u2019s no hiding that from any taxman if you wanted to.  The only way this works is if you can eventually spend it or be able to somehow cash it out without reporting.  Is this a reason everyone is getting in? (Everyone meaning the little guy) There will never be rules and regulations beyond what was created in 2009.  \n\nBut someone has to cash you out.  I admit to being worried about coinbase.  Again I\u2019m a newbie I could be wrong but it felt like what they did releasing bit cash had a lot to do with disrupting the market and what they\u2019re releasing is a direct competitor.  How do you offer at $200 per coin or whatever it started at the other day and cash people out 3 days later at $3000 a coin? How does that work to NOT put you out of business.  Also huge BC price dips with people cashing out. Are \u201cwhales\u201d using Coinbase? Someone me thinks not.  Love opinions. \n\nThen You\u2019ve got Ripple and Ethereum to create and follow regulations probably sooner than later to satisfy their backers.  It appears they create functionality in the block chain world by creating apps giving access to companies to have their own block chain etc.  this personally makes a lot of sense and isn\u2019t what Bitcoin is about or doing.  That\u2019s not what it is built to do. So they are different.  \n\nThe human piece of these and their backers make it ripe for human manipulation especially in the lack of regulation phase of the whole thing .  I like that Ripple as a currency can stand alone without its company.  \n\nI think being the main liaison for buying and selling in the US is Coinbase and then dropping your own currency on all of your new users you\u2019ve built is fair game at the moment but really shitty.  Nothing to stop them and most wont realize this \u201ctop 5\u201d crypto actually belongs to Coinbase.  \n\nAverage new crypto buyer had fun last week no fun this week and some are probably suicidal at the moment.  I couldn\u2019t do anything with mine until I understood more and since then it\u2019s gone crazy. \n\nI\u2019m looking long term. Who survives in the crypto world? ",

Meanwhile, the shepherds are leading more blind sheep to the slaughter organised by bitcoin jesus. Judas In wall Street is cashing out for 30 pieces of silver.",

The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT).

The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.\n\nI do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.",

Airdrop is supported from most of exchanges (people are not forced to use official NXT wallet) IGNIS will be credited when NXT will be held on supported exchange 28 December (supported exchanges are Bittrex, Poloniex, HitBTC etc.) and its the last chance how to get IGNIS and free from this airdrop! Another 50% of IGNIS was sold during presale ICO....IGNIS will have very solid market cap when goes live and will start trading 1.1.2018! These fundaments are seriously huge, NXT will start MOONING very soon....HODL NXT!\n\nFrom JakeTheCryptoKing:\n\nI've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop.

Every single one. Paid a shit ton in exchange fees, but I think it will ultimately be worth it. I have about 5k coins, so if I get 2500 IGNIS, that's about $6,250 in free money. That's close to my entire crypto investment.",

            "Text": "I'll say this again, NXT was one of the few coins who is still gained even through all this.... fork is coming in a few days:\n\nFrom JakeTheCryptoKing:\n\nI've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop. The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT). If you spend $1000 on NXT today, during the airdrop at the end of the week you will receive $1000 in IGNIS.\n\nThe math on that: 2 NXT costs $2.20. The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.\n\nI do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.",

It could be $1k in a year, it could be 10k in a year, it could be 20k in a year, it could be 100k in a year, it could be 500k in a year. **No one knows**\n\nI bought in with $100 in 2013 when it was around ~750. It took around 3 years before my $100 was worth $100 again. Last week, my $100 was worth 2500. Now it's worth $1600 + $244 in BCH (due to fork coins). **Never had an opportunity to cash out with profit for 3 years.** During most of those 3 years, that $100 was worth $20. Are you ready to see your $100 be worth $20 for 3 years? That's one possibility. I personally did not care and wrote it off. That's why it's easy to hold during this period for me - I'm $100 deep - none of the \"HEY IT'S 2500\" is profit until that money clears my bank account. \n\nThere is no idea what the price will be in a year. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're lying. ",

They are just jumping on the \"get rich quick\" bandwagon. The greedy influences with lots of BTC who are more interested in making money than helping crypto be mass adopted, are just manipulating the market and spooking the n00bs which leads to mass sell-offs and mass buys. The technology is moving at a much slower pace then the hype train, hence all these price changes.",

So in order for bitcoin to really become a worldwide currency it needs to grow through it's social network. As this grows , the same time it's becoming a store of value because we trust bitcoin more than banks. Because bitcoin allows us to be our own bank. As it's getting less volatile because it's becoming a store of value then it can be widely be used as a currency worldwide. \n \n\nAnd that's why we hold because we are still in the very early days.

It could be, it could not be. \n\nBTC has experienced 6 of these in 2017. \n\nThe reason it's dropping so hard is because we just experienced the biggest or 2nd biggest rally of the year (can't be fucked to check). The drop is about 66% of the way to the last drop (I think it was around $5500?) which only occurred in November. It's seeming to have a fair amount of support at 11.5k, but it wouldn't be that surprising to see one last big drop in a healthy recovery.\n\nIt dropped because it was staying pretty stagnant around 17-20k and altcoins were booming because of that stagnation. Holding BTC  or any crypto is always a huge risk (as you can see, 50% drop in a couple weeks). Meaning, investors took their money elsewhere. The stagnation indicated that there was little chance for a 20% gain. \n\nNow that the market is lower again, the chance of a 20% gain (to 14.5k) is a very likely unless it shifts off of its year-long trend. The chance of a 50% gain (to 18k) is a lot more likely vs. prior a 50% gain would have taken us to 30k. \n\nIf we hit a drop of 40%+ dip, we enter unprecedented territories that we haven't experienced since pre-1k levels. Until then, don't be too concerned. ",

I haven't held it long enough to experience that since I only hold altcoins, but it's always worth transferring to a wallet.\n\nElectrum is a good software wallet for BTC, just make sure to write everything it gives you on a piece of paper so you don't lose it. Make sure it's 100% correct. Make sure you download the correct wallets as well (one for BTC and another for LTC).\n\nAlternatively, a hardware wallet is the best option, like the Ledger Nano S.

This would basically be a death blow for all cryptos. \n\nSo please, we dont go to your various subreddits to **just shit on your project** so don't come to /r/Bitcoin to do that.

But here's the thing: \n\nDo you think bitcoin has the potential to go to $50k, or $100k, or higher? \n\nIf not, then it is not worth the risk to keep or buy something that could lose so much value or that could fail altogether and go to zero. In that case you should sell it all and invest in something else.\n\nAnd if you do think that it could go up a lot, then you are taking a big risk selling and trying to buy back lower. Because of we go to $50k or higher, it is likely to look like the rise to $100, and $1000, and $10,000. Meaning that at some point it is going to spike up hard, you are going to sell so that you can buy back lower, and then it is not ever going to go below your sell point again. So if you take the risk of trying to time the market like this you are very likely going to miss out on massive gains while trying to make much smaller profits. \n\nIt's not worth it. If you are going to take the risks that come with investing in bitcoin, you should make sure that you are going to be rewarded if it does indeed go to the moon. If you don't think there is a good possibility it will, then it isn't worth the risk in the first place. \n",

I wrote about this in the CBOE post just before it went live.  \n\nIt's so easy for them.  Short futures contracts because you hold a massive number of coins across exchanges.  Begin slowly dumping coins then gradually increase unloading them to create a sell off.  Make a ton of money betting the price of BTC goes down then buy back all the low priced coins.  This is EXACTLY what is happening.",

Those happen in healthy markets.\n\nIf the price jumps to 25K in a few days, then we'll see another correction sooner or later happen again.\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong, but I think claiming bubble requires some more arguments. Your included illustration, which has been posted numerous times, does not show any corrections occurring in the bubble's rise. It just shows a bull trap, which could be the case right now, but if its not than the whole illustration becomes pointless in my opinion. ",

            "Text": "My opinion? The correction was caused by two main factors. One was the sudden and unexpected introduction of Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase. This obviously caused a stampede. The other is people taking profits in order to buy Christmas gifts.\nIMHO neither of these events should have a lasting impact on the price. I think that the more rational-minded investors will realize that this correction was an overreaction, and they will buy back in for a great discount. I think that their tax returns will also give them some disposable income which they will feel relatively comfortable risking. \nI also think that the future looks increasingly favorable for BTC. The Lightning Network appears to be doing well in testing, and the news that Goldman-Sachs is adding a BTC trading desk, and also discussion of ETFs all speaks of big money preparing to enter the game. If the whales are already planning their moves, they won\u2019t be able to resist this current fire sale. ",

I also believe that we will see a significant uptick over the next few months, as people recover from Christmas, and as they begin to receive their tax-returns.\nSo I do think that the price could slide a bit further, but I personally wouldn\u2019t take the chance. I would go in now. Don\u2019t panic if it drops by another few thousand (unlikely, but possible). It will recover, and IMHO it will recover very quickly. ",

To be clear, we delayed launching a hedge fund with outside investors capital last week because we didn\u2019t like market conditions for new investors.   In no way does it mean we are less bullish the crypto markets.\n\nLast tweet was 7 hours ago. ",

            "Text": "If the price of BTC goes down after you sell alt into BTC then your total value in USD worth of BTC goes down. Right now most alts are trending with BTC, so don't expect a lot of deviation in the markets right now. There are exceptions, but right now is not the time to be trading alts hoping that the exchange rate increases against BTC. The market is too volatile and the risk of a newbie like yourself losing your Bitcoin is very high. Wait until BTC stabilizes for about a week. The alts should start breaking out on their own away from BTC once the fear calms. That's when it's safer for newbies like yourself to trade alts.",

They're frequently used to limit losses of negative trends: Let's say you own something that's worth $10 currently. You can set a stop order for $9 to auto-sell the item if it goes too low... that way, you sell before it hits $8 or lower.",

It causes crashes if you have serious amounts of alts, but you as a retail investor cant manipulate the market so dont worry about that. \n\nThe fact is you dont know if its going up or down, so you are gambling. If you try to short sell and things go up you fuck yourself and then have to buy in higher. Its rarely worth the risk.

One ounce of gold is one ounce of gold but the prices still fluctuate, but what if it regularly lost 15% of its value or more. Btc must win over fiat users and in order to do that it must be stable relative to everything else, you can't sell that idea to a business. I'm just saying btc has a long road ahead and it will not keep up exponential growth every month",

For example,  Chanos, a notorious and renowned short seller, has established an extremely large position on TESLA.  He is **allgedly** a large part of the funding behind many of the affirmative action related lawsuits, etc. (some other scummy stuff, but that is just a recent example. I don't believe Chanos would do that tho, but maybe some other shorters with the same position).",

I did a review of the BTC chart last Saturday and you were seeing smaller choppier moves from a base to a spike from the previous few days of long bases and steeper spikes. It\u2019s a sign of market indecision when and the bears catching up with the bulls. \n\nThat in conjunction with big approaching round numbers like 20,000 make people nervous, unsure if it will break that resistance. Once I saw that a previous high candle of 19,800 ish wasn\u2019t met with a higher candle on the Next swing I felt a downturn was coming. It means the bears have over powered the bulls. \n\nAt that point many people smarter than me and more money in it are already seeing this bear swing down and SELL OFF. It had surged so much at that point they want to gather profits. And re buy once it dips. \n\nYou have to understand many people aren\u2019t in this for the long term but as intra day moves. Quick money and volumes of moves based off swings up and down.",

I can be sure that, at least within a year, the brand new Honda Civic I'm looking at is probably  around USD 17k, and will be thereabouts next year. I cannot ever see that happening with bitcoin. I would likely have to time the exact point where the 1 BTC it's being sold at is at its perceived lowest value, or else I lose a ton of money buying.\n\n\"Not even 2% of the world is in bitcoin\" is true. But with the wild valuation swings and rapid gains and losses depending on the time frame you came in, how can you expect to get to a point where people to jump in en masse and start using it as a currency? \n\nYou need it to be stable but it'll never be stable unless it reaches critical mass, and it'll never reach critical mass until people stop treating it like a security and trading it on exchanges.\n\nBitcoin and all things blockchain are, in my eyes, a failed social experiment. The idea had promise. A digital gold, like in the old days. But like in the old days, only the first prospectors became the kings of their domain. \n\nIt was never the medium that was the problem.

It will happen on block 501451, which will normally happen on the 28th this month.\n\nWhat will happen is: coinbase will probably halt trading for a few hours beforehand, and suddenly you'll have two chains. One BTC and one B2X. Everyone will get a 1:1 ratio of B2X coins, and then a proportional amount of Satoshi's coins as a reward (?). You'll be able to sell, buy receive and send both. \n\nSigwit2x wants to do a couple of things as increasing the block size to 4mb and changing production speed of a block to 2.5 minutes. This should create less fees and make B2X a more viable coin to actually use. Atleast that's how it's intended. ",

If BTC  fell from 15k to 500 dollars over a month it would make news and destabilize the world in terms of the howling the investor class would make\n.. thus... Free fUD.  If I was NK or Russia I would be working that angle right now, anyway.  All the big money is having a showdown on this, and the little money is swimming along. I wonder what the price will arrive at when all the players have their cards on the table.  (Buys popcorn and chocolate peanuts). (Narrates actions in 3rd person present tense). Meanwhile, the market itself us dominated by message boards both public and private. Reddit gets quoted as the news writers need free commentary and info, so they publish headlines like \"Reddit hodlrs say to hodl through the covfefe.\". Thats the actual headline, lol.",

I also have questions about what will happen to bitcoin once all 21 million coins are mined. I\u2019m assuming there will be another fork but any good currency has to have some inflationary mechanism that can encourage holders of the currency to spend money. Right now I\u2019m not sure if bitcoin could ever be widely used due to the lack of effect that monetary policies would have on it. The market would determine things like interest rates which could cause a lack of lending during a recession.\n\nThese are all things far in the future but those are some of the reasons why I think bitcoin in its current state is overvalued. I like that the community did a hard fork with BTC and BCH so hopefully as time goes on, the community can fix a lot of the underlying issues with the currency.",

Here's the crux of it, the Monte Carlo fallacy basically consists on the statement that if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if something happens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature).\n\nI'm not stating he is right in calling it that, i'm not even sure how it applies to this case as it's more of a gambling related fallacy.

Considering that at one point the largest dip was 33% and 31% and then we had a 40% dip, I don't think a 43-47% dip is all that much worse. 50% would be though, because that means we're trending towards a 66% dip vs a 33% dip. \n\nWhile 10500 was the true bottom on Gdax, but that also didn't last long. Bitstamp has the top at 19,600 and bottom at 11,200. So, for shits and giggles let's instead say 19.6k peak, 11.2k bottom. That puts it at 42.85% vs the previous high dip of 40%. Must more within reason. \n\nMy cop out answer? 20k was an emotional target. And it's possible I'm making an emotional argument here and ignoring the data, but I think the market overly pushed for that barrier. The market was already showing resistance at 16-17k prior to that. [(look at the chart here and you might see my point)](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITSTAMP:BTCUSD). Hypothetically let's say the peak demand was actually 16k-17k.\n\n* 16k@30% drop = 11.2k\n\n* 16k@40% drop = 9.6k\n\n* 17k @ 30% drop = 11.9k \n\n* 17k @ 40% drop = 10.2k. \n\nSo my argument is we basically had a double dip in regards to 20k coming back to earth and the 16-17k dip that was building. \n\nAnd 10k is a bit of an emotional point as well (which could put additional sell-pressure). If we went under it, we'd be back to 4 digits.\n\nSo basically, 20k is the perfect overly enthusiastic buy target and <10k is the overly pessimistic sell target. The other \"big\" 40% dip flirted with 5K and 2.5k. \n\nNow let me be clear: that's ABSOLUTELY moving the goalposts, adding a subjective component, and redefining the rules of a pure data set to be overly optimistic. \n\nBut regardless, ignore my cop out. This is indeed the biggest 1.5k+ BTC crash at 43%-47%. I'll be getting real concerned if it does validate that 10.5k crash again - especially if LTC and ETH don't follow. ",

            "Text": "I mean, there are certainly bubbly aspects to it.  If enough people were fool enough to believe Roger Ver's talking points it definitely would have popped back when Segwit2X was cancelled.  But thankfully some of Bitcoin's best qualities are that it is democratized and decentralized.  For that reason I always tell people that if they are not going to do their homework and educate themselves about it, they are much better off saving their panic-sell money and watching from the sidelines.",

            "Text": "The main reason for me is that, unlike fiat currency, there is a limited amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist. This means that a central power (government) can't decide to just print new money (see: Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Germany in early 20th century). When a government prints new money it means that existing money becomes devalued. Bitcoin is a safe storage of value. \n\nThat said, it is a RISK. You can see from the last two days that it can go up and down in the blink of an eye. My advice, don't buy if you can't leave your investment in for at least 5 years. By that time you'll realize that the end goal is never to sell, but to have as much Bitcoin when it becomes more widely adopted.",

There are some ways you can make yourself safer, but I haven't done that sort of transaction so I don't want to speak to them too much on the off chance that I have outdated info or something.\n\nOnline reputable exchanges are generally decent, as are ATMs, although ATMs can have higher transaction fees (to cover the cost of keeping the ATM running).\n\nTypically the process with an online exchange is: set up an account, verify your identity if required, link it to a bank account, transfer in BTC, sell BTC, transfer local currency money to the bank account.  The process of transfer, transact, transfer is just reversed if you're buying instead.",

Of course, anyone who is buying into a hedge fund will be well aware of the volatility and risk/will be warned of such by the fund however having it occur in such a short space of time may make people skittish and keen to pull their funds back out ASAP or decide not to invest at all. \n\nEqually, you can also see this being great marketing for Novogratz' new fund - he publicly announces something like that and then when it happens it means that: A) he looks like he is very in tune with the market and knows what he is talking about when it comes to crypto (he probably does, but this demonstrates it) B) shows that he is looking out for clients in the longer term as he could have just tried to capitalise on the gold rush and take clients money ASAP, instead he holds off and then brings people in. \n\nGreat marketing for a new fund in a space where hedge fund investors are looking for people who know their shit (there probably aren't that many comparative to bonds and other exotic investments for example).

I would strongly suggest waiting for things to calm down a bit before making major trades, but obviously that's your call. If you like to gamble and are okay with losing money in exchange for a good time then this is about as good as it gets. If you are the type that will be woken up in the middle of the night panicking because the price dropped 30% overnight, then just take it slow and wait for things to calm a bit. There are hungry sharks in the waters right now. Be careful.",

We need to develop new technologies for this.\n\nThe current valuation of the cyrptos is **not** based on current utility. It is based on technology that could be developed, and it is based on the future (just like stocks).  Now, Bitcoin devs are the main ones trying to actually find longterm solutions.  Because some of the short term solutions have very great risks.  \n\nBitcoin is also the largest and most secure newtork.  A 51% attack is feasible on most other cryptos.  Many people want bigger block sizes, becuase bigger block sizes = more centralization = network easy to take down for periods. Right now there are about ~12,000 reachable nodesw (27% in USA, 17% in Germany, 7% in France, 6% in China).\n\nNo network is even close to this size.  Many people hate crypto and want to see us fail.  They do so by first weakening the network and then attacking it. This is the first steps of their plan. \n\n\nMany other coins also have impressive networks and there are many cool projects. Have fun, but be very aware of the intentions & motivations of those that you listen to as you decide which coins are worth purchasing. Be especially aware of the probable distribution of the coins amongst the users (in many cases the dev team will hold a very sig % of the total float).",

So they turn to a shitcoin like Bcash that they can buy more of for less. It makes them feel better thinking that, \"Oh no, while I might have missed Bitcoin, it looks as if the REAL opportunity started the moment I discovered crypto!\"\n\nGood luck. I personally think Bcash is ok, I would never own any. I just think it's retarded to want the model in which everything goes by to crash. Only an idiot would think that was good. Hence the overall crash on all cryptos right now because of Bitcoins price falling. This is what you get when Bitcoin fails. This project is fucking useless if Bitcoin can be overtaken so easily by a coin that started in fucking August. Anyone who can't see that is a fool.",

It\u2019s a startup who had no idea the amount of volume that was about to hit them this year. Predicting growth and scaling is the hardest thing for a startup to do. I work for one and we go through similar issues. This is certainly not a cash issue - they\u2019d love to take your fees if they could. \n\nShitting on Coinbase has become incredibly fashionable here which confuses me because they are the sole reason bitcoin has broken into the main stream. You can literally thank them for your gains but instead you choose to bite the hand that feeds you. \n\nThey are a young company in a space that is just starting out. It\u2019s the Wild West and we are all figuring shit out as we go. Either understand the risks and buy or don\u2019t.",

Especially information that you would really want to know before forking over your money and signing a contract\u201d\n\n-  As our experience with more than 23 000 customers shows there is enough information \nat our website. However, if you need some additional information feel free to contact our customer support team or 24/7 chat and they will provide you with any information or assistance. \n\n\u201cThey have (very coarse) trading reports dated back to 2009 but their domain was registered in 2016. They don't really say anything about their algorithm except \"lol neural networks.\" \"This means the number of successful bids by the robot always exceeds the number of unprofitable ones\" ok suuuuure\u2026\u201d\n\n-  If you are interested in technical details and robot`s algorithms, you are welcome to https://rofx.net/how-rofx-works/  Yes, indeed, we`ve decided to make trading results of our robot since 2009 open to the public and put on the web in 2016. Detailed trading reports are available for our users with active accounts. \n\n\u201cTrading statistics page is mysteriously missing\u201d\n\n-  Here is the link to our trading reports that is \"mysteriously\" always at its place https://rofx.net/trading-reports/\n\n\u201cA guarantee that any losses are covered by them\u201d\n\n-  Thank you for emphasizing our distinct competitive advantage - indeed, we cover losses when trading days are unprofitable. \n\n\u201cYou forfeit all profits and take a 30% penalty if you cancel your contract or decide not to subscribe after the trial period. And so on and so forth. I'm sure there's a lot more concerning things further down in their terms of service but I stopped reading\u2026\u201d\n\n-  And so on and so forth... If you didn`t stop reading the terms of service, you would understand that we don`t take 30% penalty when someone cancel the contract or decide not to subscribe after the trial period. We take this penalty just for premature termination of the package.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that the best proof of our stable work is the complete absence of negative feedback from our clients.",

I appreciate the cautions, [I have all of 5% of my net investments in coins (majority in cash, stocks, etfs) so I am being careful.]  My question was about theorizing that whales are shaking weak hands of their coins by engineering exchange pullbacks - and just where these coins were before the weak hands obtained them - especially over the last 4 weeks or so as the media drew so much mainstream attention.

It's just that the sharp increase after a price drop *can* signal it)\n\nATH = All time high (in the last 52 weeks). I don't touch things near there unless I have  good reason to think it will continue/stay steady. I didn't think that with BTC, which is why I didn't buy in at 4k. Turns out it kept going, which means I lost out on a lot of gains. However, I didn't expose myself to any diversifiable risk, either. \n\nLarge dip... Do I really need to explain this? It just happened. \n\nStay = price stays relatively steady for a few weeks/months without significant gains or losses. \n\nSlowly start working upwards = the price has *slowly* increased. I don't have a hard number for this, but quick, large price gains make me nervous. \n\nIt's just a really conservative investment strategy. Most of my investment goes into my 401k and Roth. What I invest myself I'm pretty risk-averse with. \n\nHowever, BTC's performance lately has proven to me that it has *some* real value, eventually. At least, it's made me willing to risk some money on it at some point (whenever I feel more comfortable). The sheer name recognition tells me that it or BCH could be game changers later. \n",

Also what bitcoin does is still very much relevant for me because the coins I hold are still somewhat tied to btc price movements. Because of this I actually dont want bitcoin to fail. I have a feeling it will though. The \"peer to peer electronic currency\" aspect is long gone (and lightning wont really solve that + segwit will not work for the forseeable future). All thats left for bitcoin is the \"store of value\" thingy but I have a feeling people only think its a good store of value when the price is going up. \n\n",

            "Text": "OK so let me reword that. I explained it pretty shittily because it's complex. Let's say you receive BTC and want to immediately convert it to cash. \n\nIf you have BTC you need to transfer it to Gdax (your customer could directly send it to your Gdax/Coinbase wallet too), which DOES have a fee to transfer the BTC from your/their wallet to Gdax's wallet (aka the bitcoin network/mining fee). The sender pays the fee and you cant get out of THAT transfer fee no matter what. \n\nFrom there, you can sell the BTC on the Gdax exchange (instead of selling directly to coinbase). It'll give you a USD balance that's ON the exchange. This can be used to purchase/sell LTC/ETH/BCH/BTC.\n\nI mentioned transferring it to LTC without explaining much. That comes into play if you want to move between exchanges cheaply (for other altcoins). You're best off converting it to LTC and depositing that on an exchange with more altcoin support. Eventually if you want to cash out of an altcoin, you convert it to LTC, send it to gdax, then you sell the LTC there and have fiat. If you do that directly with BTC you'd pay a much larger fee to transfer amongst the network. \n\nThere MIGHT be an exchange that does it without the middleman LTC support, but I've only used Gdax due to the MTGox bullshit years ago. \n\nBut let's say you receive BTC and just want to get that USD off coinbase/gdax: you need to pay (I think) a $25 wire transfer fee. \n\nSo basically.. let's say you sell a muffin for BTC. The buyer of the muffin pays a transaction fee to send you the BTC (let's say you use your coinbase wallet).  If you want to immediately hop out of crypto after the sale, you can do-so via Gdax. Now, if you want USD in your bank account you have to pay a flat wire fee to unload it your total balance. (Also hint: it's not worth it for a small purchase like a muffin)\n\nLTC is basically your gateway to transfer BTC to other non-gdax supported crypto exchanges (which should have a fairly trivial <$2 fee). That's why I mentioned it. \n\nTo reiterate:\n\nYour customer will always pay a transaction fee to send you BTC. At the moment, it's fairly high (For a quick transfer, it's $15-25 I think). \n\nA flat $25 wire transfer (if I recall) is necessary to get USD out of the exchange after you sell the crypto for fiat. It's fine to be sitting there indefinitely (but again, a risk if Coinbase goes under like MTGox did). \n\nSo\n\n1. If you plan on dabbling in altcoins, you'd be best having the customer send it directly to an altcoin exchange wallet.\n\n2. If you plan on immediately converting to USD, you'd be best having them send it to a gdax wallet. \n\n3. If you plan on only dealing in ETH/LTC/BTC/BCH you'd be best having them send it to a gdax wallet. \n\nThe LTC \"trick\" is only necessary when you are doing 1. \n\nAlso you probably don't want to use BTC unless you're dealing in large transactions. At the moment, $15-25 fees really kill its instrumentality for low-value transactions. ",

But a couple of things:\n\n1. you are now likely paying short term capital gains instead of long term capital gains (big difference)\n2. Also i this appraoch if it goes to 0, then in scenario A, you still may end up paying taxes even if you don't actually make any gains on your investment by the end of it. Its pretty crazy, but it does happen.  many guys during the tech bubble didn't realize the tax implications of many of hteir actions and ended up bankrupt. \n\nIn scneario B, you get ot enjoy long term capital gains and you never had a tax event until your final sale.

BTC is the long-and-far the worst offender ($6-25 usually, at peak $50) when it comes to transaction fees.

Swede guy going on every single traditional media channel to say Bitcoin sucks and it is dying as the \"CTO of bitcion.com\"\n2. Bunch of contrived transactions (see the analysis on Twitter)\n3. CNBC and Ver planning interviews to totally bash Bitcoin\n\nThere are a lot more. The BCH guys think they are trying to make Bitcoin better, I do believe they are sincere. A lot of them put a lot of time and energy into this project (especially Ver). I understand completely why they are mad, and they have every right to be.  But right now they are being used like pawns by bankers to attack the cryptomovement so the Bankers can win with centralized coins like Ripple or AmazonCoin.\n\nI do agree that it has always been like this, and will always be for our lifetimes.",
