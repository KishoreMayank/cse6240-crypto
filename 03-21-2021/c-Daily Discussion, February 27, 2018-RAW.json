Bitcoin Eyes $11K After Upside Break**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/bull-return-bitcoin-eyes-11000-following-upside-break/\n\nView\n\n-Bitcoin looks set to test $11,000 today and could extend gains to $11,385 (weekly 10-MA). A violation there would shift attention to key resistance levels: the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the descending trendline.\n\n-A daily close above the descending trendline would allow for a stronger rally to $17,400 (inverse head and shoulders breakout target as per the measured height method).\n\n-Bearish scenario: Rejection at the weekly 10-MA, followed by a quick drop below $9,280 (Feb. 25 low) would add credence to the bearish weekly RSI and trigger a sell-off to $8,000-$7,800.",

            "Text": "No. Immutability is one of the key characteristics of distributed ledger technologies. Without it Bitcoin would lose a lot of its value. It's quite important to actually understand how unique and valuable of a feature this is. Most things in the world can be undone, reversed, forged, duplicated etc. Bitcoin's blockchain cannot.  \n   \nAside from who would actually have the power to authorise such reversals it would dramatically lower the overall level of trust in the system. If you allowed to reverse a transaction in extreme circumstances (like theft) would you also allow it in case of user mistake (e.g. sending to a wrong address)? What if the user paid for something and then claimed it was a mistake and wanted the transaction reversed after receiving the goods or service? As a business accepting bitcoin payments, would you put trust in it knowing that transactions can be reversed? How about transactions worth millions? What if the government didn't like some transactions and wanted them reversed? You see where this is going?",

Worse yet since you didn\u2019t hold the initial investment for a year or more your gains would be subject to short term gains tax at ~30% +\\-.  I am just letting some newcomers that are playing the daily short game that your probably not going to make that much money and worse yet you won\u2019t be able to claim a loss. Some people make money playing this game and Im not judging but in this market - unless you have substantial assets I don\u2019t see penny playing is going to win you anything.

Double spending is prevent by the network agree that ownership of a coin ( or part of one ) has been transferred from one public key to another. When a transaction is issued until it is confirmed in the Blockchain it stays in the mempool and you can\u2019t send that coin again until it\u2019s added to the Blockchain ( that\u2019s my understanding kind of a newbie) so in my head double spending is prevented by the network consensus on who owns the coin based on who\u2019s public key it was last seen at in the Blockchain with this coin only being accessed and sent onto someone else by the private key to that public key .\n\nSo what I\u2019m imagining is some way that in circumstances that network participants allow transactions can be pulled from one public key and return to the previous one . Not sure how this would work or if it\u2019s even possible.\n\nAlso transaction are reversible I think if one controls 51% of the network and does a Sybil attack . But if this happens then the network is devalued and the effort that goes into doing a 51% attack in terms of energy and computing power needed coupled with the devaluation of the network means it\u2019s pointless to do so .",

            "Text": "Yes, no one can answer those questions but if you really want certain answers. Few videos ago when BTC was still around $11000, i said that we are in a retracement and we are going down towards $8900, we didnt quite hit that mark but i guess u can take that moment as a definite sell moment. that would be $1900 profit per BTC as we hit $9200. Also if you want certainty then i would say to sell now at $10950-$11000, reason for that is that meets our downtrend line. You secure your profit if you buy at $9200, this gives you $3800 profit per btc with this 2 trades. Now it comes to our condition of if btc can break the down trend line. If no, then i would ladder my buys between $8200-$8900. If yes, i would buy a break out above $12000-$12200. These would be certainty. What Technical analysis does is it gives you these trade options, you can't always think to ride one wave up or down. Of course if you are a hodler, you don't have to worry about TA at all.",

That, by the way, is a major block to this idea that these cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) will somehow replace the way we currently do things.  It just won't work for most people, and in other ways beyond the particular examples we are talking about.   One can imagine insurance companies that would sell \"bitcoin insurance\", but then that's back to \"centralized\" bodies and what-not.\n\n\nThe more one thinks of how bitcoin etc. could be widely adopted and replace regular money and its systems, the more one ends up with something that looks like regular money and its systems.  That, to my mind, is why bitcoins etc are ultimately a dead end, except perhaps as investments or gambling tokens etc.",

Right now I can't buy at 9200, so it makes no sense to tell me that I would make 3800 with two trades that depend on an impossibility.

Ans even then, why not $11500-12000, or $12500-$13000, or some other random pair of numbers .  \n\n\n",

            "Text": "> ummm..reducing loss in a way is making profit no? \n\nNo.  Reducing loss means your loss is smaller than it would otherwise be.   It is still a loss, unless you reduce it to zero.     In the example I gave you, there is no way to interpret the reduction as a profit, unless on Mars perhaps.",

Instead, he sees the possibility of this big retracement and sell at $15000 to take a $2000loss. He is now smart and starts to cost average his buyins. He buys back 0.5btc at $10000, buys back another 0.5btc at $8000 and buys 1btc at $6000. Now he sells all at $11000, by taking the $2000 loss initially, guess what, he just sold everything for $22000, a $5000 profit instead of a $12000 loss. By reducing your losses smartly when you see a big resistance level and swing trade your way up, you will make profit. ",

Of course, if it doesn;t keep going down, then he is up shitcreek without a paddle.   Can he, or you, predict downward trends and how long they will last?   I don't think so.  Until that changes, scenarios in which people smartly take an initial loss and then things nicely work out so that they will nevertheless profit from downward trends must remain as pure fantasy.    \n\n",
