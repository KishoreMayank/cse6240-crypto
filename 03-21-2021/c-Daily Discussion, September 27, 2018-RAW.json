I dont have a massive amount of money, but off the bat i could toss $100-$400 in there. That being said, i dont know what the worth of BTC is projected to do. Would it be a good investment?  Should i wait?  What\u2019s the best move and why?  It\u2019s also worth mentioning that i use coinbase at the moment, but ive been seeing it called \u201cshitcoin base\u201d. Cant tell if this is a joke or not, should i be using some other means of investing?",

If I try to send funds from it it says I cant because there are no funds.\n\nIs it possible that my transaction anyhow got lost ? Ive checked the address a million times and it is correct.\n\nDo I need Eth funds in order to receive Etc???\n\nPlease help.\n",

So the only reason to not use cbpro and rather use coinbase is pure laziness. 5% markup + withdrawal fees all for nothing much more than not bothering to do 5 minutes of learning on cbpro.\n\nI don't however think all of this leads to possibility of any lawsuit though. No one forced users to not do a few minutes of learning.",

I once bought an old house for cheap on the corner of a street hardly anyone used, because I learned that there was a plan in the works to build a strip mall and an off ramp from a major through way just a few miles away. I them sold it 2 years later a 3x what I paid. Speculation?",

            "Text": "I agree, but there is a steady, almost unstopable growth that has been happening for a long time, and I believe that it will result in many people wanting to have at least a small piece of the action. With such a small Bitcoin supply, compared to the number of potential investors out there, there's a strong likelyhood of opportunity for buying now and making serious profits later. \nPerhaps it will be just greed and speculation that drives it, perhaps currency use, maybe network value, store of value, gateway to other projects that may find huge success, etc. Nobody can truely know what the future holds, otherwise we'd all be rich. But with so much potential for success, I'm willing to risk losing x amount of money on the potential that within the next 5 years or so I may have many times more than what I invested. Even if it amounts to nothing more than a platform for speculation and more hands join the game, it's still worth being in that game before another big run up.",
