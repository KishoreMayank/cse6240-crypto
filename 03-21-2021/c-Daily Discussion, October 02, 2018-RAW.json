The professional market making community comes to every market that shows some promise of growing. \n\nI see that the price is at $6500 again today...seems to me that there is a growing presence of market making algorithms operating that will buy low /sell high with relatively low risk . On the one hand this is good for helping keep a solid bottom in place....on the other...it provides a bit of a roof for rapid advancement of price in the short term...which can lead to one of two things\n1. lack of upward trend eventually frustrate/discourage some hodlrs and causes them to sell and we get new lows\n2. stability leads to more dollar cost averagers joining the savings program...continued organic growth fuels price higher...market maker ceiling gets blown through at some point.\n\nBecause I am optimistic on this technology/movement, I think #2 is just a matter of time ... new bull market will start in 1-6 months.",

            "Text": "Can we have a debate between BTC & ETH as it concerns future-proofing?\n\nThere are three fundamental differences I would like to understand the logic of for both projects.\n\n1.) PoW vs. PoS\n\nIs PoW or PoS better for a layer 2 solution? I believe layer 2 is the future, and will be how blockchain scales. It seems both BTC and ETH agree on that, yet one prefers PoW for security and the other prefers PoS, respectively. \n\nSo what's more secure in your opinion?\n\nI know PoW uses more energy and costs more, but if 99.9999% of transactions will be occurring off-chain, then that doesn't matter so much, does it? So shouldn't the question be mostly about security? Is PoS also more secure? If so, what is the argument on the other side?\n\n2.) VM on layer 1 vs. layer 2\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of having a VM on layer 1 as in ETH compared to layer 2 as in BTC? Does it make ETH more complicated than it needs to be for the base layer? Will that affect future development? If so, what is the argument on the other side?\n\n3.) Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n\nAs I understand it, BTC wants \"money\" to be on the base layer as it will make layer 2 more secure, whereas ETH wants \"money\" to be on layer 2, which could very well be deflationary, even if the base layer is not. Is the uncertainly of the supply of ether a problem for a base layer? I know Vitalik has been thinking a lot about this from Twitter, but I don't have a clear picture on the pros vs. cons of this to make up my own mind. What arguments are being thrown around here?\n\nI do feel like this uncertainty in supply is weird, because how can anyone plan for the future when the supply is so uncertain? Are there any benefits to the uncertainty, does it not matter, or is this definitely going to be addressed in the near future?\n\nIf Ether ends up having no value, as the essay titled, \"Why Ether will eventually be worth zero,\" asserts, and which I agree with (arbitrarily creating fees for using an open source protocol will be competed away in a free market, and Ether doesn't need to have value for the network to be secure, because miners will likely accept other digital currencies, including money developed on Layer 2), then the supply of Ether doesn't matter, right? Just want to make sure I'm thinking this through.\n\nI'm looking for well-reasoned arguments for or against a position, where it is clear you have researched both sides and understand the arguments against most of what you're saying, but also have counter-arguments for them.\n",

            "Text": "Bots have definitely been active as of late. I have been noticing that there is very large size on the offer but no actual real orders behind them. People see this size - get nervous - sell. It slowly ticks lower and lower with the same thing happening on the offer. I believe they are trying to accumulate as it moves down and then at some point they just lift their offers and the market moves higher very quickly which can be added by them buying a good amount when they lift, just spraying the other offers with buys. This forces people to jump in quickly and price moves up extremely fast where they can easily offload their positions. Rinse and repeat! \n\nBest thing to do is just not trade while they are doing their thing and just pick good entry and exit areas and not worry too much about what they are up to in the meantime.",

Many are waiting for them before adding support.\n\nOn the general scale, the big issue is reliability - while there are no fund loss, the amount of unsuccessful transactions is still pretty high, and there are some rather painful edge cases where HTLCs get stuck for days. In other words, when it works it works beautifully, but when it doesn't it can get ugly. This is a big obstacle for the \"streaming money\" use cases, i.e. things like paying 1 sat per every meter of scrolling on Reddit - 99 out of 100 transactions succeeding and one getting seriously stuck is not good enough there.",

            "Text": "I agree. I always look at these two use cases separately. 1) store of value like digital gold 2) everyday transaction currency. \n\nNote that the first is what lifts the price up. The second may well follow from the first but also may not. A govt issued fiat cryptocurrency has a good chance of becoming the defecto for usecase 2 but in no way can compete on use case 1 with bitcoin. \n\nI am not sure why many seem to think a crypto either has to achieve both or end up as nothing.",

The post you are referring is back when I said Bitcoin network growth will lead to inevitable demand via many factors, and ETF/bakkt was just one of them.\nI see outrageous things posted here and on many chat/comment platforms - both in favor for and against bitcoin. If I had to go and individually address each one that's all I'd be doing. So if it makes you feel good to criticize me, have at it. I personally think it's petty and small, and you're lying out of your keyboard because again, I never said that.",

            "Text": "It's built in to the specification.  I believe it's fairly arbitrary.  It seems the intention was to encourage more channels (connections) between nodes instead of fewer larger channels which may make routing more difficult.  \n  \nI found this [article](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/bitcoin-lightning-things-to-know-e5ea8d84369f) on the subject.  Kept digging and found the reference to this limit in the [specification source - BOLT 02](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md)  \n  \n>The requirement for funding_satoshi to be less than 2^24 satoshi is a temporary self-imposed limit while implementations are not yet considered stable. It can be lifted at any point in time, or adjusted for other currencies, since it is solely enforced by the endpoints of a channel. Specifically, the routing gossip protocol does not discard channels that have a larger capacity.  \n  \nAgain, it looks to be arbitrary and if you hack the source code for your own node, other nodes should accept your higher capacity channel without question.",
