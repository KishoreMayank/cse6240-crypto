            "Text": "**100 Merchants Can Now Trial Bitcoin's Lightning Network Risk Free**\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/merchants-bitcoin-lightning-network/\n\nA few lucky merchants now have one less obstacle to accepting bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network.\n\nRevealed exclusively to CoinDesk, payment processing startup CoinGate is opening up a pilot program that will allow 100 merchants to trial a Lightning-enabled version of its service, one which taps into the open-source tech meant to make bitcoin transactions fast and cheap.\n\nAs with CoinGate's standard service, the company will handle the finer details of crypto-to-fiat exchange, however, the new pilot has the benefit of covering the costs should funds be lost due to the early-stage nature of the software (lightning implementations are now largely in beta).\n\nAnd while most experts believe the network still isn't ready to support significant commercial transactions, CoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas thinks there's a greater good that will be achieved in being among the first to test the waters.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n\"It's a very new technology. Inevitably there will be some bugs, either in our implementation or in the Lightning Network. It will help, not just us, but the whole community because the bugs we find might help the whole protocol.\"\n\nAlthough Lightning invoices are typically limited by the protocol itself to 0.042 bitcoin each, or under $300 according to current prices, CoinGate CCO Vilius Semenas told CoinDesk there's no established limit to how many invoices CoinGate will reimburse if funds are lost.\n\nAt least for the time being, few shoppers have the resources to send cryptocurrency from a Lightning wallet such as Zap. But this pilot could test whether Lightning actually tackles some of the issues that deter mainstream merchants from prioritizing crypto payments in the first place.\n\nFor example, bitcoin's latency presents an issue for CoinGate clients like the Romania-based adult content platform LiveJasmin.\n\n\"Instant payments are the most important from our point of view,\" Tam\u00e1s Szerencse, head of payments at LiveJasmin, said, expanding on why the company joined CoinGate's Lightning pilot.\n\nWith up to 40 million daily visitors, LiveJasmin could become one of the biggest mainstream merchants to experiment with Lightning so far. Experimenting with more diverse transaction types could provide invaluable insight into how Lightning works out in the wild.\n\nLearning from experiments\nAs such, CoinGate is emerging as one of a small, but growing number of crypto payment processors to take the leap. (Last week GloBee helped crypto hardware wallet accessory provider CryptoCloaks accept its first payment.)\n\nStill, most acknowledge there's still a long way to go until mainstream merchants could safely use Lightning.\n\nSteve Beauregard, the founder of the payment processor GoCoin, told CoinDesk he agreed with Bieliauskas that layered networks might be able to reduce friction for recurring payments, but he acknowledged the tech is still in its infancy, which is likely to limit shoppers.\n\n\"It's still very complicated for an average end-user to use it [Lightning],\" Beauregard said. \"I think the ones that benefit the most would be international merchants that are trying to accept payments from overseas.\"\n\nThe majority of merchants who applied for this pilot were businesses like collectibles maker Bitgild, which offers silver and gold coins engraved with QR codes for real cryptocurrency, catering to clients who are already fascinated by Lightning experiments.\n\nBeyond cross-border payments, Bieliauskas argued Lightning-enabled transactions could soon provide a cheaper option than credit cards for merchants dealing with micropayments or payments worth a fraction of a penny.\n\nFor now, Beauregard said the primary value such Lightning pilots offer is an opportunity to participate in experimental research.\n\nSpeaking to that point, renowned Lightning developer Alex Bosworth agreed this pilot will provide a learn opportunity for the whole network. Lightning's most useful features for merchants are still in development.\n\nBosworth told CoinDesk:\n\n\"In the future, one nice thing about Lightning merchants is that if they invoice you in one currency and the payer wants to pay in a different currency, that will be possible.\"",

Here is a comment that has already been submitted that you can use for inspiration:\n\n\"I strongly support the proposal of Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn December because of SEC approval of Futures, Bitcoin went up from $3K to $20K. we again need SEC help to make money for small retail investors who lost lot of money in last 7 months. ETF has potential to take the price of Bitcoin from $6K to $30K in few days and that can start the new crypto cycle and help US economy during these trade wars.\n\nETF will be the great news for US economy. crypto is the future and US can lead the world by allowing ETF.Crypto Investors around the world is eagerly waiting for SEC to approve it and support this revolution.\"",

Apparently Jamie Diamond threatened to fire everyone if they invested in bitcoin and people are scared. He can't keep the lid on this forever, though, and there is already an underground resistance fomenting. Most traders on my friends team are planning on investing in bitcoin secretly but they have to do this after work otherwise they might get fired by Jamie Diamond. My friend said that most people in his office are home by 5:30pm so we can expect to see a large boost at that time. Some people are even plotting to see how they can get home faster than other people on their team so they can buy in first before the price spikes, LOL! Apparently it's all over Wall Street as a big middle finger to Jamie Diamond.\n\nEdit: GS stock is DOWN today on this news! Investors will not have it!\n\nEdit 2: It looks like tons of GS investors are selling their stock to invest in bitcoin directly. Jamie Diamond can't stop them all. ",

I only have about 10 devices that can handle Skype) but a few people have suggested another idea which I think is great.\n\nI'm going to be starting a weekly community meeting where we can discuss bitcoin, study the white paper, and organize community outreach projects. So in addition to our Wednesday night white paper study, we'll also have a group meeting on Sunday morning. I'm looking for a place to host this now (I'm thinking we can rent a space in a strip mall cheaply and easily).\n\nIf anyone has suggestions for our activities I would LOVE to hear them! So far I'm very interested in organizing some outreach ideas:\n\n\\- Door to door canvassing. Maybe there are some teens or young adults that could do this during the day?\n\n\\- Let's organize a group project to help build blockchain infrastructure in countries that are less fortunate. I'm thinking Haiti, South America, or parts of Africa?\n\n\\- For people unable to do door to door canvassing, let's print some pamphlets we can leave on people's windshields, in their mailbox, at bus stops, etc. Let's spread the word!\n\nThis is super exciting. Let's DO THIS!",

            "Text": "In theory, the Bitcoin Network will adjust the level of difficulty in mining blocks to keep miners solvent and incentivized.  Still, I am not sure how the math 'trickles down' to smaller players vs. the hash rate mills.  The level of difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.  And based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block every10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took longer than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find. \nhttps://blog.bitmex.com/mining-incentives-part-1-the-difficulty-adjustment-and-mining-profits/\n",

I ran the first BTM in my city during the bear market of 2014 and converted all profits to btc. I got contacted by the IRS and had to shut that down cuz getting Money Transmitter license was too costly. I quit working/graduated college in 2015 with a psych degree, moved oversees, started building a btc network there, and took the plunge to become a dedicated trader. I rode the bull market up for 2 years only going long. I've been shorting since January. Absolutely crushing it. I now work intermittently as opportunity presents itself. \n\n",

Then, rent and staff.\n\nCountry with low cost of electricity and labor have a clear edge against western country with expensive electricity and cost of labor.\n\nAt the cost of my electricity, I would be in the red operating a Bitmain S9 atm even if I would not take into account rent and labor as a hobby miner. So BTC mining at this leverl of difficulty and available hardware is already not profitable for some countries. It\u2019ll will be kept for large mining operation or hobby miner having access to cheap electricity.\n\nProfit are in the toilet for miners. Also for GPU mineable altcoin. You can buy GPU from Nvidia by 10 units now. They were limited to two unit per person until recently and that\u2019s when they were in stock, now it seems Nvidia would like to get rid of their oveprovisionned stock.",

Pooled funds are used to buy BTCs.  Since this is a single asset ETF, cash based unlikely to be used.\n\nb.   Synthetic ETF - Derivative, zero capital goes into BTC market.  The ETFs are traded as a function of BTC's price.  This will be the likely ETF for BTC.\n\nIn short, neither scenario does any good for BTC.\n\nLike I said - this is just another gimmick that trading houses want to create to earn commission for themselves and provide you more ropes to hang yourself.",

Fawk , it's amazing how many people bring their stock market perceptions to the crypto space and forget what crypto is. So many people looking to trade it and invest in it, and completely dismiss why Bitcoin exists. It needs to gain legitimacy and solidify its place as an alternative currency. Being taken more seriously is going to require serious players to get involved as part of the adoption cycle. This is more than something to trade and gamble on and to imagine how this space is going to look in 10 years from now, you have to broaden your perspective way past the stock market mentality.\nRead up on some of projects underway to improve transaction rates, peer to peer trading, real estate purchasing, etc. It's not just another stock like entity. It's a game changer that will take years to mature.\nIf you're trading it and shorting it and what not, that's the only world where you see crypto and that's the only way you'll perceive it.",
