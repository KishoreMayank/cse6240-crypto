Even back then it started sounding ridiculous and that was before there were exchanges popping up everywhere, a huge increase in the number of Bitcoin ATM's, multiple developments and layering solutions, proposed ETF's, bakkt, an entire crypto ecosystem, apps, and much more. In general, it's a rapidly growing bitcoin infrastructure. You seriously believe that after surviving 10 years of massive challenges, that it will go away now with all this additional integration with society?? Forget about the price movement and think with logic. You'd have to be the most stubborn person on the planet to not acknowledge that you're wrong to dismiss the long path of growth bitcoin still has in front of it.",

As a consequence, it may be that it also gets accepted widely in transactions but this is not guaranteed. Acceptance in transactions has many other criteria to it. Easiest way to see this is why do shops in various countries prefer to accept their home currency and not necessarily some of the relatively harder major currencies like usd, eur, GBP? Merchants need to see what their taxes are due in, what their suppliers want to be paid in, etc and not just what is the hardest currency. \n\nTransactions and store of wealth are really two independent use cases.",

As I said, there had not been sufficient history of bitcoin to know which models work but now we gain more confidence in them for future use.\n\nThe rise in search results post October is irrelevant as that was a volatile and non boring period.

I like the fact that Bitcoin is not tangible and thus has no storage costs or security concerns of the same nature such as what storing gold entails (yes there are other kind of security concerns with bitcoin storage but I prefer dealing with those than guarding a safe). \n\n2) Blockchain aims to replicate the same kind of persistence, scarcity and immutability. Now I wouldn't go too the same planetary time frames you have mentioned but perhaps good enough. \n\n3) and 5) don't really address why gold has value. You are essentially giving examples of where it was considered valued.\n\n4) is a matter of debate because it is widely believed that while there are industrial and other uses of gold, those alone fail to explain more than about 10% of its market value.",
