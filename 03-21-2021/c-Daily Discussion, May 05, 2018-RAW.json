He's too old to change and has this old school mentality that the current system is running just fine.  And why should he otherwise given he's made billions from it? I still like Buffet, but I do NOT believe for one second he doesn't understand cryotocurrencies and their inherent value. He's simply spreading massive FUD because it directly threatens his very own system of creating wealth. But also, I do NOT believe for one second that he doesn't own any Bitcoin...maybe he's not directly trading it, but someone at Berkshire quietly is for him.",

Nobody will own any BTC, or even need to purchase any, they're literally just betting on the price going up/down and exchanging fiat.  Hence why people saying this is institutional money flooding in are all kinds of wrong (at this stage), but it does indicate a certain degree of legitimacy (if you call investment banking parasites legitimate...).",
