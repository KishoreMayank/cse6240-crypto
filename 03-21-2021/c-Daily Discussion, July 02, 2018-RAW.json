But there's one reason above all else why Bitcoin will almost DEFINITELY rise to many X its current value... HUMAN GREED. As long as there's a platform for people to triple their money, there will be people pumping money into it. High risk stocks, Vegas, betting on sporting events, etc.\n\nNow couple that with an actually technology that could potentially revolutionize the way we exchange value, and you've got a hell of a resilient monster that will continue to grow for a very long time. But anyway, NOTHING can outperform human greed. Nothing.",

You join a payment network and go offline. Anything that can't stand up to a simple, cheap attack is worthless. You still need the chain capacity if you don't want bitcoin slowing to a crawl and freezing up for weeks with backlog of transactions any time anyone decides to attack you. \n\n- An attack isn't even necessary - an internet outage somewhere (there have been a few major ones every year) can have the same effect. Reliability is going to be very low.\n\n- Cost is unreliable. Multiple things will often force you on chain, at tremendous cost as bitcoin scales. You don't know if you'll pay 1c or $50 for your $30 transaction, and have no control over it.\n\n- They can be spoofed\n\n- The DDOS problem isn't solved and doesn't appear easily solved (this is separate from the issue above)\n\n- Mainstream users aren't going to accept flakey solutions that require constant work adding and funding different channels. There's a chicken or egg network problem here, a bit like FB or MySpace, but a lot worse.\"\n\nIs this true ?",

To atone, you must pay a total of 0.00000421 bitcoins (0.00421 mBTC; 421 satoshi). Pay to the address 37SqHU6s8aYjUd7mtgdERHReVqYdd6YtE8. Once you have paid the full amount, wait a few seconds and then reload this page. If the fee is so small that your wallet is unable to send it, you can send any larger amount, though you will not be refunded the difference.\n\nAlternatively, any forum staff member and some other notable members can manually whitelist you. Paying the fee is probably easier/quicker, though.\n\nIf you don't have any bitcoins, you can get small amounts of free bitcoins using the sites listed [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=74046). It is recommended that you give the free bitcoin sites the address listed above. Do not collect money in your own wallet and then send the bitcoins to the forum -- this will likely result in significant network fees.\n\nIf you find any bugs in this system, email pbbugs-J6X0kjVn@theymos.e4ward.com. For example, send email here if your payment is not registered an hour after sending it. The mere fact that payment is required for your IP address is never a bug. **You will be permanently banned if you send email here requesting free whitelisting.**\n\nPeople commonly say, \"I haven't posted anything before, so why on Earth am I banned?\" *You* are not banned. Your *IP address* was previously used for evil, so everyone who uses that IP address has to pay this registration fee.\n\n  \nI asked my friend to join and he got the same message and another friend made an account and he got a different amount, even though they're on the same IP. I think it's a scam, they're asking money to whitelist you.   \n\n\nAnyone know about this?",

Bitcoin is manipulated, when you see the majority of the opinion on Reddit be bullish, the price tanks, because people are selling into the dumb money. Same with December pump. Bullish everywhere. People purchased bitcoin on coinbase, but didn't receive it for a couple weeks. So the majority of the bitcoin being bought by new users, was not liquid. Less supply to buy because they are locked up thanks to slow banking transactions and clogged blockchain network. Futures trading released at the same time. So here you had people with knowledge of the market, and the capital to control the price in a low liquidity market. They knew that the bubble would pop, because they were going to be the ones to pop it. Any amount they lost selling their coins, they made up for in their short. And they knew that they could do all of this, because every possible crypto news source told people to \"move their coins into a hardware wallet, away from exchanges (so they cannot sell it), and to HODL, because once again, they won't be selling it. If they wanted to sell it, they would have to transfer it back from wallet to exchange, wait a while, and by the time your coins are on an exchange to sell, the smart money is already done with their move.",
