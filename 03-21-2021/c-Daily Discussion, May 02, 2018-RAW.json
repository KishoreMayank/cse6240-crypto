Are whales and institutional investors the same thing? Yes and no. There are several whales who bought large volumes of Bitcoin in its infant days and scored big. The Winklevoss twins are the perfect example of this. There are many whales who aren\u2019t as savvy as you\u2019d expect; they just own a lot of Bitcoin. They don\u2019t have any connection to corporations and institutional investors like hedge fund managers, investment banks, mutual funds etc. This is what separates the typical notion of whales with institutional investors. They share many similarities and institutional investors can become whales but whales typically do not become institutional investors. Whales have been around since the beginning, institutional investors are new to BTC. When institutional investors fully mobilize with Bitcoin, we will see its largest gains ever because Bitcoin will finally have a keen sense of legitimacy. However, even today, Bitcoin is still being questioned and associated with labels like \u201cpyramid scheme\u201d, \u201cblack market\u201dand \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d This is the biggest challenge for Bitcoin (and definitely not mining or hashrate as you unnecessarily brought up). Bitcoin was founded as an alternative to the greedy practices of banks and investment managers like Goldman Sachs, but it\u2019s still perceived to be a get rich quick scheme.\n\nInstitutional investors will help bring credence to this asset class (the irony being that institutional investors are very shady people). Your remark about HODLers wasn\u2019t necessary. I agree with you in the grand scheme of things, HODLers have very little influence over BTC\u2019s price...but they do control their own wealth through personal decisions. Overall, you do have some good things to say; you\u2019re just misinformed on institutional investors relationship with Bitcoin.",

It\u2019s not a good idea to daytrade Bcash, week trade may suit you much better (one trade a week). BCash has been stuck in the $1200-$1500 range for over a weeks. It\u2019s pure whale manipulation via buy-sell walls maneuvering in forward and reverse directions. The whole concept from the whales is to psychologically test inexperienced traders and day traders using emotions and fear. The whales are being very spontaneous and confusing to get you to panic-buy and panic-sell. Of course the Bitcoin ABC fork is less than 2 weeks away which is the primary catalyst from our lows in early April. This is why BCash will not dip below $1200. The whales themselves fear institutional investors beating them at the own game, so they will not allow Bcash to crash until the fork is released. Also, the whales are challenging the Bcash market to see how ordinary traders respond within every surge. This far, they have been very disappointed which is why they continue to fluctuate Bcash in hope the market reacts differently. ",

The TA people will try to tell you otherwise but they are full of shit.  TA absolutely works in a mature and involitile market.  Crypto is neither for now.\n\nThe only pattern is 'randomness' (or what appears to be random to us, it's not really random), and the only certainty is that some coins are better off trading than others in case you get bags- don't trade coins you wouldn't also hold.  That being said, swing trading crytpo is *extremely* profitable if you know what you are doing.  ",

Institutional investors are still observing Bitcoin trends and waiting for it to hit rock bottom which it still hasn\u2019t. Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course). Most institutional investors will actually buy when they see far more bullish trends and not the back-and-forth volatility we\u2019ve been accustomed to the past few months. Institutional investors don\u2019t like volatility. Once they see stability and bullish trends after Bitcoin bottoms at the $75 billion market cap ($4400/bitcoin) and recovers to $200 billion ($12K/coin)...that will regain confidence with institutional investors. From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. This is an inevitability but it will take time. That\u2019s why those who HODL will be rewarded exponentially. But, most people grow anxiously impatient. Just like we have many slow Bitcoin days ahead, we will also have days when you can make thousands of $$ overnight. I made about $6K last night.",

For those who have access to billions, those prices are peanuts.\n\nBut there's one thing institutional investors like, and it's assurances. They like to make sure they will get their profit, one way or another. This is where Bitcoin still could fail.\n\nI agree with you in the sense that Whalers will control the next crash, but in my opinion, the whalers are the institutional investors. In my opinion, they are already in the market, making money and moving their pieces into key places of this massive crypto-game. \n\nWhy am I certain of this? Ask yourself. If institutional investors likes assurances, wouldn't they want to have control of the game? They will do what they have been doing in every market. Controlling it. \n\nBitcoin is a scarce currency right? Control a large piece of the currency, and you will control the direction of the market. \n\nHODLER's don't control shit. They are out of the market. They have no influence on the bitcoin market value. Yes, some of them will probably get rich, but not that many.\n\n> From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. \n\nBillions would need to enter the market for that and institutional investors are not there to inject value. They are there to profit. To take value out of the market.\n\n\n>  I made about $6K last night.\n\nMaybe yes, maybe not. Good for you, if true. \n\nEdit: At 4,4K, there's a large piece of the network hashrate which will disappear, since it will no longer be profitable to mine for a large portion of miners.\n",

            "Text": "You just proved my point. Like Facebook their servers are simply worth what they cost to make. But since they are used to employ facebooks network on they become infinitely more valuable. But it does not have any inherent value so to speak.\n\nSame goes with Bitcoin, it is just like fiat in a way. It has value because we, the network say it has value. And when we compare the two it is very clear what is the best money. Therefore our network will grow, and so will its value.\n\nIn truth it is the consensual agreement between the people in the network that gives bitcoin its value. As you probably know a UTXO is simply a piece of data that proves you can make it appear inside a different box essentially.\n\nThe same thing goes for a lot of different things too. For example government, there is no inherent value in it. It is the people's coercion or agreement that gives it value. One may have a collective agreement on taxing the people to provide a police force through the government, because the people think that safety is valuable (yet still that too is just an opinion). And some people disagree with the concept other people have of safety, for example is it safety to have a armed guy take plants from people who pose no threat to others, is that valuable? Probably not to the people who just want to be physically safe. But for some reason the police are tasked to do this.\n\nWhy? Because a network of people with the power to task them with it, holds the power to say that it is valuable.\n\nLike we hold the power to buy Bitcoin and say it is valuable.",
