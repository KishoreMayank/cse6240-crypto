It is a good place to get your feet wet with 50 bucks and get comfortable with addresses, sending payments back and forth etc.\n\nHowever, if you don't know the secret code that proves you control that unit of Bitcoin, you are always at the mercy of the secret code holder (Coinbase) going bankrupt, stealing your Bitcoin, being commanded by the government to not pay out your Bitcoin, et cetera. That's why people say: not your private keys, not your Bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase is essentially acting like a bank, saying \"don't you worry your pretty little head about hard things like secret codes. We'll take care of that for you.\" Just like a bank stores your cash and valuables. It's a lot of trust to give them.",

Part of the fundamental guiding principle of many early Bitcoin pioneers is that the current banking system, where banks are free to lend out the money deposited, and only keep a tiny bit available for withdrawal, is immoral. It creates a danger of bank runs causing insolvency, and encourages banks to take wild risks with depositor money, knowing that they will be bailed out by the government if they go bust. The bank acts like it merely stores your money, but really, that money is gone. Some people believe that's a fundamentally unethical business model. If your money can be seized or confiscated, is it really yours?",
