And when the Bank of America starts accepting crypto, its cryptos will be stolen too, again and again. In other words, banks get robbed because that's where the money is. Only when enough goods and services are available for cryptos and not fiat will people not need crypto exchanges. It is the fiat\\-crypto interface that will always be risky. When [Augur.net](https://Augur.net) gets up and running, you can just make bets on whether a major crypto hack will take place by a certain date and time. If you make the time far enough into the future, you will make money if anyone accepts the bet. Which they won't. ",

Then they get 5 months of bad news, and they're ready to abandon ship. We've heard many, many calls for the death of bitcoin, and the ecosystem didn't have 1/10th the capability it has now.\n\nThe price dropped from $38 to $2 for a reason: people thought they would be totally worthless. The price dropped from $250 to $90 because people thought it would be totally worthless. Now people are realizing again, \"hey it really could be totally worthless\". Same type of people get shaken out each time - weak hands.\n\nIt ain't a sure thing, but the stakes are huge. If you bought in at $1000, I'm sorry for your paper losses. But if there's a 10% chance this thing could have the market cap of gold, it's worth the risk to me to keep a small portion of my assets in the protocol.\n\nI believe in the mission, I believe in the math, and I believe in the ecosystem. And it's been one hell of a ride. I'm not getting off now just because some bureaucrat in China farted.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22qc1d/comment/cgpfxwe",

Didn't really know what I was doing, but it pretty much turned out to be a total loss and I lost *a lot* thanks to mtgox and my own haphazard storage of my currency.\n\nGo figure, I had some extra money and despite the fact that I'm totally out of the loop on the goings on, I bought some BTC less than 24 hours before this dip. \n\nAny thoughts - realistic, optimistic, pessimistic - are welcome. I understand that these fluctuations are par for course, but Jesus Christ I've had bad luck with this \"investment\". ",

I don't trust non-hardware wallet solutions, yet I am willing to accept a lower security since it's a hot wallet.\n\nWhat is the safest/most user friendly option out there for me? Are there more than average risks involved with having a mobile wallet as opposed to a desktop one? \nI would prefer to use a hardware wallet on my hot wallet too, but consider them to be too expensive for the use-case so I am open to hearing other suggestions.",

The price dropped from $250 to $90 because people thought it would be totally worthless. Now people are realizing again, \"hey it really could be totally worthless\". Same type of people get shaken out each time - weak hands.\n\nWell, the problem now is, the cycle has repeated enough times to become predictable, which makes it a problem. If it can be predicted, then it is open to be exploited.\n\n\nEdit:\n\n>  But if there's a 10% chance this thing could have the market cap of gold, it's worth the risk to me to keep a small portion of my assets in the protocol.\n\nGold has an advantage. To make it work as a currency, it does not need to be continuously mined. Once it is mined and minted as coins, you can shutdown the mining operations and still use it as a currency. With Bitcoin, you cannot do this. Bitcoin needs mining to be constantly working. ",

They need to pay their bills and they want to profit. Add to this equation the fact that there are lots of whalers out there with more than 10K in Bitcoins, and you will start to see some large dumps.\n\nGood luck in *hoping for the best*!
