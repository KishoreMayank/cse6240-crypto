            "Text": "2/3 of the world's wealth is not is held in currency. It's held in assets, real estate, etc. There are many benefits of tokenization, but the best example I have heard to explain it would be this: \n\nConsider that there is art, some on display in museums, some held in private storage. Often a museum will work out a deal with a private owner to let them display the art in exchange for keeping it safe for the owner. Less wealthy people can't invest in expensive art because the pieces are way beyond what they can afford. If the art was sold via digital security tokens, hundreds or even thousands of people could own a small portion of an expensive piece, buying as little as 50 bucks or thousands if they prefer. For many sellers, this is a much easier way to sell than finding a single buyer. As the art appreciates, the investors all make money. This can be applied to almost anything and is a game changer that will receive instant demand. Keeping it all in the crypto ecosystem, it is almost certain that bitcoin will be the currency used to buy various tokens within security token exchanges and this may end up being the strongest use case for bitcoin as a currency that we've seen yet.",

I couldn't see why the present owners of assets like art would want to do this, but your idea that the market becomes bigger when trying to sell makes sense.  It was more the case of assets like retirement accounts that are currently protected by custody arrangements and insurance like FDIC or SPIC in certain cases.  Tokenization would seem to make these assets more vulnerable to hacking than they currently are where there are human actions all through the process.  Potentially corruptible human actions, so investors' calculations may change over time.",
