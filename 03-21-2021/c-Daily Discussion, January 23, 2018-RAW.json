Before investing (or dumping) any investment, do your research into what it is you are actually investing. There are so many people who are eager to give you advice because they usually stand to gain financially from your decisions. The basis of science is peer review. You cannot confirm on your own what will happen to the \"price\" of bitcoin at any point in the future, but you can verify with simple maths that it does work today. Be careful out there, happy hodling.",

Let's see how much will cost one Ripple if the Bitcoin price goes down to 7.000 USD. Last time when Bitcoin was 9.000 USD than Ripple was about 0.89 !!!! Basically what the governments did is made you sell your Bitcoins and now regulate how you can buy back them. If the altcoins what you get for exchange your Bitcoins fall down to 0 USD you can go out to the garden and hang yourself because governments and U.S corporate media just wiped your money out of your packet. This happens if you listen to them and you are speculative. You going to loose now everything! ",

When the price is rising, you wanna buy, even though you should have bought when it was low yesterday. That\u2019s what makes hodling an attractive proposition, just buy what you can afford then don\u2019t look at the daily price fluctuations, just follow the long term trend. Sure you could try day trading, but you have to think logically and without emotion, which for the vast majority of people, myself included, is extremely difficult.",

Though it was learning about Ethereum that made me finally get Bitcoin and what the whole space was about.  Also learning that Bitcoin is a breakthrough in computer science and genius technological invention that is global and can not be shut down and its the first time in history that ppl have a legitimate secure option outside of govt. control is such a big deal its unbelievable that the price isn't already 100k.  And the having the regulated exchanges like Coinable and Gemini as well as the option to put on Hardware wallet, made it possible for somebody not computer savvy like myself to finally get involved.  If you don't have anything in this space now is as good of a time as any, especially if its for a 1-5 year holding period.  I would def get some ETH and maybe LTC as well.    ",

So be very careful and make sure you do your own research (30 minutes as an absolute minimum, ideally a lot more, even if you only bet a small amount). ",

It's blockchain is by far the most secure - not only by design and hashrate, but this has been proven over nine years of attempted hacks, attacks, takeovers etc. It's Proof of Work method is well tested. Other cryptos are not trying to compete on security (they can't), so go after \"fast and cheap\" transactions instead.\n\n2. Decentralization. This is one of the founding and most important tenets of bitcoin, and that which allowed it to even succeed in the first place. Bitcoin is consensus lead and has no central authority, whereas many other of these \"fast cheap\" cryptos rely on control by central nodes, companies etc. IF a cryptocurrency isn't decentralised, is there really much point in it?\n\n3.  Development. Bitcoin is aiming to develop solutions to scalability, transaction time, price etc. **without** compromising the two points above. This is a highly complex and involved task! But it is proving possible, and with Segwit, LN and other developments down the road, Bitcoin is proving to be the most technologically advanced crypto out there. (Which makes sense, it has an army of developers behind it)\n\n",

I believe that BTC will find it's market value only after the price has fallen so much (and so frequently failed to hold a recovery) that speculators have given up and moved on to other opportunities (so-called \"blood-in-the-streets\" capitulation of the market). Whatever exchange value is left should then be be based on the need for BTC to conduct actual transactions and store wealth. I watch the market carefully and I don't believe we've seen complete capitulation yet. I would like to see a near-universal mainstream media chorus of: \"See! The bubble has popped. Bitcoin was for suckers\". Once that happens I will have faith in the trading that follows.",

I absolutely love the idea that wealth can be kept and not confiscated.  Portable.  Hopefully anonymous also one day.   I don\u2019t quite understand the privacy implications yet. Part of me thinks it\u2019s a gift card you buy and if it\u2019s thru an exchange then every penny can be tracked back to yon.  This needs to change. Hopefully it does and that\u2019s what I\u2019d be cheering for:   A true cash replacement. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten any other coins. I figure that because I\u2019m buying so small at a time it\u2019s best for me to just average in over time.    I imagine BTC is akin to USD in forex market.

Because the sell-off is very aggressive. I mean, 60% retracement **without** very negative news is not normal and it would be caused only by people that recently bought in and have no idea what this market is.\nThey know only that they could get rich just by investing reckless.",

Some events can be explicated and anticipated, just not all of them.\n\nOf course Bitcoin will rise again, but this time far beyond 20k$. Why? \n\n1) Because there are a lot of people that did not enter the market yet. Why do i say that? Because the average people that are not security experts were afraid to invest in cryptocurrency and this year with cryptocurrencies becoming easier and easier to handle and hold they will join the movement and invest.\n\n2) With the Lightning Network, Bitcoin will open the gates to a lot of companies to accept it, because it will be cheaper and faster, gaining new acceptance.\n\n3) After being regulated, people will gain a lot more trust in Bitcoin and we'll see a new wave of people investing.\n\n\n4) Big players will support this market ( because they make a lot of money ) and pump a lot of money in it, but you have just to be smart ant not to be trapped \n\n\nSo, there are plenty of reasons for Bitcoin to grow this year.\n",

They use it to buy bitcoins, trade those bitcoins - keeping the bitcoin prices artificially propped up by using fake money to buy it - turn around and trade their now higher valued bitcoin for USD and pocket the $.  \n\nBitfinex is doing all sort of other shady things and various market manipulations as well - all of which are highly illegal in the US stock market. \n\nThousands, perhaps 10s of thousands of crypto coin holders are allowing this tiny little company (3 man shop) from the Virgin Islands to get away with this because they 'believe' without any proof what-so-ever that this company is legit and the 2.2 BILLION crypto coins they've dumped on the market are actually worth 2.2 BILLION usd. (they've never even been audited tho their site claims they have 'frequent audits')\n\nIf you read thro their TOS (which changes nearly constantly) it's such an obvoius blatant scam, tho I am pretty sure all those claiming people are just using FUD know that and just want to keep the masses believing it's real to avoid the inevitable that this could cause. \n\nThem dumping 100,000,000 a day of their play money (crypto coins) on the market almost every day could very likely cause hyper inflation (google wheelbarrow currency) making their coins that are supposedly worth $1 each worth .01 each on a good day.  \n\nThis could cause something similiar to a 'run on banks'  causing bitfinex, bittrex, poloniex and the others exchanges heavily involved in tether's funny money to become insolvent could cause the other legit exchanges to go down temporarily or possibly long term as well. Coinbase is actually fdic insured for any USD held in it's exchange but I don't know what sort of time or hassles it might take to get your money from the fdic.\n\nHere's the kinds of things you'll find on their sites TOS \n\nTether must and does at all times reserve the right to refuse to issue or redeem Tether Tokens\n\n\n\nTether assumes no liability or responsibility for any offer, representation, suggestion, statement, or claim made about Tether, the Site, or any Service by any Associate.\n\nanyhow I've been discussing this for days you can check thro my post history last 3 or 4 days - and see what you can find there - use that info to google and do your own research and form your own opinions.

It helps increase the blocksize and allows for more transactions in a block and makes your personal fee less per transaction.\n\nSchnorr and Lightning well on their way to being mainstream. Schnorr can help cram more transactions into a block with multi-sig technology. \nLightning is second layer and therefore works off the bitcoin blockchain but transactions on lightning take seconds instead of 10 minutes like the bitcoin blockchain and fees can be less than one cent. \n\nIf you want to help yourself right now though, get a Segwit wallet. It makes transactions about 30% cheaper. If more people pick it up the better the Bitcoin network will be. ",
