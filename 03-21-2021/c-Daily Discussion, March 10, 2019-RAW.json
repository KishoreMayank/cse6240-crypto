It\u2019s an I hate the fact that 12 board governors and a Fed Chair making monetary decisions that affect the whole world is not freedom or capitalism.  \n\nThe Fed is a monetary version of the Politburo in the U.S.S.R. The media and the 2 party system distracts the vast majority of people with this stupid bs fight of them acting like babies against one another.  \n\nIf more people were woke like me to how mathematically if you just looked on the debt clock and saw rising debt and rising money M2 money supply, you would think, I don\u2019t want to own dollars, I\u2019d rather have hard not pos money instead. \n\nThat is why I buy Bitcoin.",
