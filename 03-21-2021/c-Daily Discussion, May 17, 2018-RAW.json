It feels like we could be having this conversation today under our current circumstances.  Similar FUD, concerns and hopes.  I really think 4 years from now people will be looking back on our threads and wishing they had a chance to get on board the bitcoin train in 2018 when the price dipped.  Thanks to bitcoin's scarcity and the fact that there can be no more than 21 million coins, ever, I firmly believe we will see the price of bitcoin continue to grow substantially in the years to come.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jtg4h/daily\\_discussion\\_may\\_16\\_2018/dz46816](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jtg4h/daily_discussion_may_16_2018/dz46816)\n\n\nEdit:  p.s. the OP in that thread is probably rich beyond his wildest dreams today.   So in other words, it\u2019s not too late for us either. ",

So, our despair is just making more trouble for all of us. \n\nWe need to think that some of the factors (i dont need to mention)that made the market going down is in direct relation to some of the biggest centralized institutions of our days, in the same way that are other factors as well, I mean: the comunnity going into panic.

            "Text": "i was studying the charts earlier and noticed since bitcoin was invented it has had 2 parabolic bull markets. 2013 and 2017\n\nin 2013 the bitcoin price run was basically 20 to 1000 or a 5000% increase. in 2017 it was much smaller at 2000% but still very much a run. 2014 also had mt gox go nuclear.  also note at the lowest point in the last bear market bitcoin never even got close to where 2013 started before the run up. the market low was found in spring of 2015 around $220 or 10x higher than the start of 2013 however it was an 80% peak to trough. after this it was an uptrend for years with corrections along the way. we had a MUCH smaller run in 2017 at only 2000% vs 5000% in 2013 and no mt gox blow up. it seems very unlikely to have a repeat as the news is actually really positive and you run into problems with the network in general below 5-6k minimum now. we also have already had a 70% correction with no where near as bad of news and no where near as big of initial run up. an 80% correction would be BTC 4k.  miners will start shutting down due to low profitability around 6k and or difficulty will have to fall....in fact that's already starting. you actually get more coin selling hashing power now than you did at this time last month. many of the dec/jan gpu miners are likely already leaving.\ufeff\n\nthe thing i noticed about all modern parabolic moves is they rarely if ever recover quickly. bitcoins massive run in 2013, the nasdaq in 1999. the thing that gets me though. both of those prior examples had real fundamental reasons that brought them down. 2017 really did not. people just sold....well. because lambo and beach house. \n\nif history repeats 2018 will not rally, it will simply be a consolidation year. weak hands will be shook out. difficulty may even fall on many alt coins. maybe even bitcoin. we may have seen the low at 6k and we may even test 5. going to 4 would be an absolute floor unless we are destined to go to zero. i'm sure a lot of miners would shut down. network traffic would fall. 80-90% of altcoins would die. \n \n\nmy personal feeling is this may be a range bound year. we probably have an absolute floor at 5k and might go there if a hard attempt is made at the last 6k support. we also likely have resistance at 12k that will push back if we move through 10k. \n\nlong term. this is healthy. weak hands are shook out and those of us who stick around will be able to mine easier and accumulate at good prices. \n\n",

A week later, they realize their friend got laid because he down'd a fifth of soco after a 4 game run on the BP table and scored with the hot chick in his science class at the very same party...Translation, remember when your mom or dad opened a facebook account?  Yea, this might take a while.",

It was a relatively small-range oscillation over several days.\n\nWhen the 9.7k price level broke down, I was mentally prepared for a new market cycle if it turned out that the range 7.7k-8.2k failed. However, at this point, I am considering the possibility that we might already have a new market cycle building up at current price levels. If that's the case, then I wouldn't be surprised to see some heavy purchases of specific alt-coins.\n",

Support around 8100 and sentiment in general really has taken a beating and although there's as many buy orders down to 8k than sell orders up to 9k, the momentum of closing longs as we approach 8k could just rip right through it. People seem to prepare for another pullback to at least 7800, so I'm hoping for a positive signal from Korea to break the current downtrend.",

I think the main issue arises when you go to spend them, if both addresses are used as inputs in the same transaction they will then be linked. but this should happen only of the send amount exceeds the balance in both addresses. Ledger (and probably others as well) makes this easier by giving you the option to create different accounts with different public addresses, and then only sending from 1 account.",
