For people who haven't spent one penny on btc, when the height of insanity was 20k, and now we're at 6k, \"near\" could be $4500.  And that would be correct from their perspective.   Even $3500, could be near.  Or Maybe $6000 is the actual floor by consensus.  Who the hell knows?  For those who bought high, then \"near\" will never be near enough, as we continue to look for the floor.   I've already taken losses larger than most average people.  The only thing I'm worried about is a game changer, that could impact all of crypto currency.   A technological breakthrough, a new tech that surpasses the current one completely, or a flaw found in the foundation, or maybe a global economic contraction of the biblical kind.  That's what I get a bit concerned about.  Not the price floor seeking.  Let the sumbeech go to 4000.  I'll just buy some more.  It'll help with my earlier losses.  It also gives opportunity to people with lesser means when the price drops.  Patience is the word.  We could be riding the floor, plus or minus 15 percent for a long long time.This is not a new pattern...  \n[https://i.imgur.com/v88sL3d.png](https://i.imgur.com/v88sL3d.png)  \n[https://i.imgur.com/DHNrDc3.png](https://i.imgur.com/DHNrDc3.png)",

MEANWHILE EVERY MILLENIAL RETARD THAT DOES ZERO INVESTING RESEARCH CAN BUY FACEBOOK, APPLE, NETFLIX OR GOOGLE CALLS AND MAKE BETTER GAINS. WHILE SOME OF US SPEND HOURS READING WHITE PAPERS, UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS, REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS WE CAN SEE, GET SHIT. WE GET TO JUMP INTO TETHER TO SAVE LIQUIDITY AFTER THE LAST FUD POST ABOUT SOME BUM FUCK EXCHANGE WITH $1 MILLION 24 VOL GETTING HACKED. SERIOUSLY WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. THEN YOU HAVE SOUTH KOREA BANNING IT, NOT BANNING IT. INDIA BANNING IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCY IS AND ARE SCARED STUCK LIVING IN 1900S SHITTING IN A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM.\n\nTHIS SHIT IS EXHAUSTING AND A JOKE JUST LOOKING AT OBJECTIVELY THEY WAY MEDIA COVERAGE IS USED. ONE WEEK THEY ARE PUMPING IT, ONE WEEK THEY ARE BEARS. ITS SO OBVIOUS. IT'S WORSE THAN THE FED WITH INTEREST RATES ONLY THIS SHIT IS 24/7.",

(2) Granting your $800 loss per Bitcoin assumption, then this whale would have lost $75 million not $100 million. Do the math. Nonetheless assuming he holds, he will soon recover that loss and even make great profits. But, I have no sympathy for someone who can drop $630 million on BTC assuming this madeup story is true. You know this guy is a billionaire and unlike us normal Joes, he has plenty of more money to use to recoup his losses. Basically, this is a guy who was up in Ritz Carlton hotels and drives a Bentley.",

Nonetheless assuming he holds, he will soon recover that loss and even make great profits. But, I have no sympathy for someone who can drop $630 million on BTC assuming this madeup story is true. You know this guy is a billionaire and unlike us normal Joes, he has plenty of more money to use to recoup his losses.

Only an idiot is selling right now if you even understood what is what was around the corner people need to look beyond the tape and see this is clear market manipulation to get these prices as low as possible the big institutional guys are mad they weren\u2019t in the stuff when it was cheap so they\u2019re going to do whatever they can to get it back to where it is cheap so they can go ahead and come in the writing is right there in the wall it\u2019s real simple all these trading desk run by Fidelity Goldman Sachs they\u2019re going to get there liquidy up before they start getting their clients and their 401(k)s and retirement plans involved and when that happens guess what all those coins are going to be held not sold. They\u2019ll be taking clients money and invest in it for long term and guess what you\u2019re not going to be able to buy a cheap bitcoin anymore because it\u2019s going to be trillions of dollars in the market have fun trying to time the market buddy see you in the soup line eventually when your millions run out. Give advice stay up on the news read up on Fidelity read up on what\u2019s going on instead of just running your trap thinking you\u2019re some big hot shot master traitor you\u2019d be running Goldman Sachs or Fidelity yourself if you\u2019re that good at it I can\u2019t wait to ride passed you while you\u2019re in the soup line in my Lamborghini or Ferrari once bit coins $250,000. That goes for anybody who thinks just like him and the rest of us hodlers I got your back. Remind me of the guys said to sell bitcoin when it was $150 I remember that said it was never going to go beyond that said it was in a bubble just makes me laugh now it\u2019s so Ludacris ",

I was going to use my profit to pay off my home mortgage and ease up my finances to the point I could change jobs and find something for less pay that I enjoy a heck of a lot more! So, after I finally made the decision, before I could get home it started tanking and has been in this free-fall for a while so any restlessness is because I am still stuck at my crappy job and still have a mortgage payment. Just been waiting to see that spike to get me back to where I need to be. \n\n...but you are right, it does affect your health.

All risk/reward ventures entail losses.  Short players have an important role keeping the market honest. But they take losses just like everyone.  It's about managing for the long term. And looking far enough out.   Keep diversified.  For people with small amounts of capital, their best investment is themselves.  Earn, and save.  Earn, and save.  The nice thing about  being young, is that you can take $500, or $1000, and put it into something like bitcoin when it comes along. Maybe it'll pay off. But if you lose it, it doesn't even represent a drop in bucket of a lifetime of earnings.  Just don't make it a habit to buy at 20k, and sell at 5k.  ;-)",

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and Bitcoin is the most trusted and proven one.\n\nSo the logic follows: if Bitcoin fails, an entire technology is abandoned.  The likelihood of that is close to zero.\n\nThe entire market, however, is a mess.  Anyone with any critical sense can see that.  There are hundreds of random, valueless coins - with no discernable new technology to offer - making gains of hundreds of percent overnight - that is completely unsustainable. \n\nSo in that sense, there probably needs to be a 'crisis' like this to shake out all that nonsense.  The market has been pregnant for that culling for months.\n\nMy only real change in view since Jan 2018 is that the timescale for recovery may be longer than expected.\n\n",

Everyone is making a big fuss about this crash, nobody needs more idiots making them feel bad because they didn't extract every cent out of it. The next bull run will make this crash a flat line on a chart, and anyone who sticks around should be encouraged.",

I recognize there is a non zero chance their nefarious efforts could be successful at delaying adoption for many years longer than it should.  \n\nYour insults are pointless.  I will keep fighting this war for currency independence.   You can go back to your bear den circle jerk now.  Good try. \n\n",
