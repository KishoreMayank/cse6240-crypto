When people post a Bitcoin donation address, is that the public key of their hardware/desktop/exchange wallet or is it a specific wallet they use for the donations only and transfer funds around later?

If you want to play that game and become a day trader you might be able to profit off the mistakes of greedy novices - or you could find yourself to be one of them. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and the engineering and ecosystem are strong. Bet on Bitcoin for long term growth, but expect a lot of volatility along the way. It may go up 20% today and drop 20% tomorrow and stay low for a month before it surges back up. Remember that Bitcoin is still very, very young and the market has barely begun to mature. I know we hear this a lot, but this is like TCP-IP and WWW in 1996. The bubble (which is inevitable) hasn't even begun to inflate yet.",

The amount you want to actually transact goes to the address you want it sent to whereas the rest goes to a \"change\" address.\n\nIn the case of software and hardware wallets, this change address is automatically generated and linked to your wallet so that you still see this change (which you can spend in future). You would not be aware that \"change\" was created and linked to your wallet.\n\nIn the case of a paper wallet, a change address cannot be created and linked to your wallet as there is only one address. Therefore, any change is considered lost.\n\nPaper wallets should always be swept. This means the entire amount should be transacted.  This is what the warning was in reference to. \n\nThere is also some risk from public key exposure after each use but that's relevant to all addresses and not yet a real risk.

If you would now send someone 0.1 \u20bf, from this address, the miner would happily take the 0.9 \u20bf fee. Every tx output thats unclaimed is fee, that\u2018s how fees work. So, in order not to lose your money, your new tx has to have two outputs: one with 0.1, and one with (0.9 - fee). The second one should point to a new address you created, e.g. a new paper wallet. Wallet software does this automatically for you. ",

Makes no sense to me. I would have thought the size would be similar the whole time, like if sending \u00a31k a couple months ago was 300 bytes then why would sending \u00a31k now be over 1,000 bytes?\n\nFees per byte going up i can handle and it makes sense, but the amount of bytes going up by several times doesn't seem normal. Being quoted $100 fee at 500sat/byte is insane.",

The alternative is to use \"hot wallets\"; software or hardware wallets used to transact as and when you need. They take care of the change addresses for you as well as providing the security so that your private key isn't broadcast (obviously, there are limitations here).\n\nThe addresses are irrelevant. It is the wallet capability we are concerned with. Hardware and software wallets are capable of creating more addresses based on your seed. (the seed is essentially a user-specific passphrase from which public and private key pairs are generated and it is this which allows you to backup your wallet and recreate it if necessary with all coin-containing addresses intact).\n\nClearly, a paper wallet has no address generating capability (it's a piece of paper or rather a single address contained on a piece of paper) hence it must be swept of the entire funds.",

I know it sounds cold and insensitive, but while some people may care deeply about Hawaii, their loved ones, etc., markets tend to be sociopathic. \n\nI'm not suggesting that we use nuclear alerts as a trading strategy or even that it's OK to do so (I agree it's messed up). I'm just asking if anyone knows whether the markets reacted to this news and, if so, how. I can guarantee you, for example, if this occurred during the trading day, stocks would have dropped sharply immediately only to recover once it was announced to be a false alert. ",

In essence, every input is regarded as needing an equal output. \n\nSo, for example, if you receive 1BTC but want to spend 0.25BTC of that there has to be an output of 1BTC from which that 0.25BTC is spent. The rest goes to a change address. \n\nThe best way to think of it is as though every input is equivalent to a cash note or coin. It can't be split - only spent, and the change returned. I hope that helps without confusing things. \n\nCold storage is a great idea but makes things difficult if/when you want to remove any forked coins. Another thing to think about. ",

            "Text": "Imagine you change the scenario, so instead of talking about BTC you are buying and selling:\na) a pen\nb) a car\n\nThe point is that in case a) someone has ended up spending 14,000$ on an almost worthless pen, and in case b) someone has sold an expensive car for 100$. There are always going to be losers, no matter what the intrinsic value of the thing being traded.\n\nBitcoin growing is very different to AAPL growing. 1 BTC isn't really that different in 2010 compared to 2018. AAPL at the start was a guy working in his garage, and it now has huge numbers of employees, offices and shops around the world. Just the amount of land owned alone will be thousands of times higher. And the most crucial thing is it returns a dividend to the shareholders. ",

            "Text": "We might have to agree to disagree. The value of BTC is whatever the current market rate is. Of course it's possible that we look back one day and say BTC was worthless all along, but as of today there are plenty of people willing to pay 14k for it. You have to measure it by it's current value, just like apple is measured by it's current value. \n\nYour examples of buying a pen or  buying a car are irrelevant because you are implying people paying something other than the current market rate. If someone paid 100k for BTC today, then they'd be a loser by 86k. If someone paid 14k for a $1 pen, they'd be losers too. But buying BTC at 14k today doesn't make you a loser since you can immediately sell it for 14k if you change you mind. Paying market rate for any product does not make you a loser. \n\nLastly, BTC growing in value is the exact same as every other asset growing in value. Yes it's true that apple has an underlying company which has evolved, but that doesn't matter. People want to pay 14k for BTC today, it's as simple as that...if you listen to people on this board, then apparently BTC is going to 100k soon. Who cares if the underlying BTC hasn't changed? People pay for expensive art work, and it's value rises too, even though the painting remains the same ",
