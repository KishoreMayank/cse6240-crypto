As long as all participants agree on the outcome of the contract \u2014 a \u201ccooperative close\u201d \u2014 the clever combination of Schnorr and MAST offers both data efficiency and privacy.\n> \n> However, if a Taproot smart contract is complex enough \u2014 that is, if there are many potential outcomes \u2014 the Merkle path that needs to be revealed in case of an uncooperative close would still be data heavy.\n> \n> A follow-up proposal by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell, \u201cGraftroot,\u201d could provide similar benefits as Taproot but without this downside, offering even more smart contract flexibility.",

In 10 years there will be many more that will become an adult knowing all about it. Thus, more addresses, demand, and the same 20 million BTC. Mean while crypto ATMs and services that every bank will integrate will progress.\n\nThe average Joe is always getting fucked with. We could all die from a nuclear attack tomorrow. For no reason and no way to stop it... In my opinion, if humanity continues without catastrophic events then this technology will continue to run for hundreds of years.",

Myspace / Facebook are social networks where users have very little at stake, there is no personal wealth held or exchanged on there who's security and utility depends on the network, there is no cost to set up accounts on either platform, bugs/hacks/rule changes don't leave users without their life savings so there is no risk in going to a new platform with potential hidden flaws. How each one operates isn't decided by consensus of users, but is controlled by the companies that run the platforms, so you are at the mercy of what the company thinks a good platform is, if a better company comes up and the old one doesn't change everyone has no choice but to switch if they want the better experience, they cannot collectively improve the experience themselves.\n\nswitching social networks operated by different companies is inconsequential, and the only option if better ones come up. This is not the same for a global currency operating on consensus.",

We\u2019re just getting started. I thought the internet was coming for education next, but it came for finance. The internet optimizes out censorship, rent seeking, and middlemen. In every single case where those efficiencies exist, the internet has demolished the status quo forever and taken over. \n\nBitcoin is very much like TCP. Buy. Hodl. Patience.",

Currently, the \nvalue of bitcoin for a transaction must be assigned a dollar amount, and you must use the exchange rate between the virtual currency and the dollar (depending on the country's law) on the day of the transaction. \nThat's because it is so early in development, the system only accepts the dollar for taxes. Your putting forward an issue that would clearly be a NON issue if bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency, and it seems very obvious that one day it will.\n\nLook, I get it - You want to troll and play devil's advocate, yada yada, but if you're going to evaluate the future potential of something, keep the associated processes involved relative to scaling process. Be a credible troll. :)",
