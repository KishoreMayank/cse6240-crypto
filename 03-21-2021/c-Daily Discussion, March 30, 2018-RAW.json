I believe that some of those credit card companies charge 20% plus in interest. You now know that experts on reddit are full of shit with their charts and price predictions and even though they call this a community, you are basically all on your own in your own financial hell. But look on the bright side because now that reality has made itself known to you in such a dramatic fashion you can make yourselves feel better by downvoting this post. Oh how that will make me feel bad. Ha Ha ",

It went down to $6k in February and then would go back up to $12k within weeks and yes we are back down to $6k yet again, but consider the Dec/Jan boom as a sudden sprint that bitcoin took for the first time in years without any conditioning prior and now these downs and ups are just heavy breaths after the sprint. And the next sprint will be for the gold medal this year, next year, or someday in the next decade without a doubt in my mind I\u2019m not saying btc will in fact be equivalent to $1million one day but I do most certainly believe in it\u2019s potential to reach above $100k. due to the trends of it\u2019s exponential growth in the past decade. It is an odd analogy I know but I don\u2019t see any roller coaster memes much these days. All we await for is a brilliant mind to figure out a simple way to make security habitual and easy to utilize on a smart phone that has blockchain technology default on smart phones sort of like Apple Pay. When that day comes and consumer stores like Walmart implement the tech we will look back on these days and wonder why we even sweated a drop. And maybe I am wrong entirely but that\u2019s a partial bit of my vision with it all.\"",

Holding is a general advice for newcomers, it's not a god-given commandment and people can both hold and trade at the same time using different stacks. One of the benefits of holding is that filing taxes will be far easier for holders since every trade is a taxable event. (Trading myself, perhaps I will one day wish that I listened to that advice, who knows)\n\nIf I had bought bitcoin at 20k, I would have sold it at a point where I observed solid indications of a drastic fall in price, and then rebought back later at a far lower price. However, this is also a potentially risky maneuver if the timing isn't properly executed. As a generalized advice, holding is a decent strategy until a person has gained experience with the market, and even for experienced traders it may turn out to be a good strategy for long-term investment. In any case, experienced traders at least have the options to adjust to a changing situation.",

Without that type of FOMO dumb money flooding in Bitcoin will sink back down to $1000 again, because why wouldn't it?\n\nI'm bullish in the long run but let's not kid ourselves - these markets NEED that FOMO money to reach new ATHs.

To me, that's fun.\n\nI don't think it will disappear, certainly not overnight, but, as far as I can tell, Bitcoin is not sustainable.  It's technology is not unique, and, to be frank, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to use.\n\nNow, on the one hand, Bitcoin's success would be good for me as it would be great for semiconductor investments.  On the other hand, it's failure would be nice as I would finally be able to upgrade my graphics card without paying ridiculous prices, or having to wait.\n\nEdit: fixed some grammar",

If people are weak they don't deserve to be strong when bitcoin inevitably goes ATH in 2021 when it reaches 1m like McAfee predicted. No real investor sees 20k usd as the end game. We invest because it's the next greatest mark in our future. Block chain is the future. We just have to wait for it to catch up. Think of us like where internet was at 1995... Nobody used it but a few nerds. Now it is integral to society. Bitcoin and block chain are the same way in that regards. Let the weak sell and the strong invest in a better future.",

It is funny, I thought the thread was an absolute classic.\n\n\"im a bad trader and i KNOW im a bad trader\". Classic shit.\n\nBut if someone is about to panic sell, telling them not to is only going to delay it. They obviously are too leveraged and don't know what the fuck they are doing if they are that panicked.  \n\nWe need to have more reasonable discussions on what bitcoin is, what your timelines need to be, how much of your portfolio to invest. \n\nOne of my friends does not make much money but he put in 300 dollars into bitcoin - even for him that's a lot of money, but with this downtime he hasn't said \"damn maybe I should sell\" because I've explained to him how the timeframes with bitcoin should be looked at. Even though it's a lot of money to him, he's still not hurting that bad. He wasn't putting in rent money trying to make a quick 10% profit like some of my retarded friends that make 70k+.\n\nI don't know you allergygal, I don't know how long you've been in bitcoin. Me, I lost coins in mtgox. I have perspective because of that. I am FULLY aware that bitcoin could crash waaaay lower than 6k. I don't even sweat this. This is nothing...for me to legitimately be worried about bitcoin it would have to drop to 3 digits again. Even then, I'd have to be worried for a particular reason besides market forces.\n\nThe whole reason for me to own bitcoin as an asset is to hedge against inflation, hedge against a possible tyrannical government, and to shield my assets from a divorce/lawsuit/crazy IRS shit, what have you.\n\nNone of those reasons are short term, as you could tell",

Many people who complain about holding don't seem to factor in that you can do both at the same time. If your trading stack is separate, then there is less risk of fomo-based decisions since you already have a stack for holding.",

And it has the first mover advantage. \n\nAnyone can make their own blockchain if they want to. Anyone can invent something better than blockchain too.\n\nSo? And as for reasons stated before I'm bullish on Btc. \n\nAlso whoever thinks we will get quickly rich is mistaken. Surely if you win a lottery ticket with some random shitcoin going up like hell then yeah.\n\nPersonally I'm 100% in Icx since the beggining. Before I hodled BTC for quite some time. And I'll be back in it. \n\n",

A person who bought at 20k in December might have learned enough about the market a few months later in order to execute a sale + lower rebuy with decent timing. Not necessarily, but I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nAlso, what do you mean by not likely have worked out? It obviously can work, it's just not recommended since it comes with risks, and it will take a lot of time as well so you would need to do it when you have sufficient spare time such as during a weekend. That's one of the reasons why people recommend holding, at least until a person have proper experience.",

The BIG money listens to this subreddit since we are the tastemakers for the entire crypto community. This is why policing our content is so important. If any false FUD or lies enter into the discussion than we are not putting our best foot forward to the community and therefore Wall Street and the big investor types who watch CNBC and other networks. If anyone has contacts with The Wall Street Journal please let me know because I am compiling a list of positive reddit comments to send to them. Hopefully they will publish them in an article about bitcoin and crypto currencies since they are one of the largest financial newspapers that old dinosaur stock market types read hoping to get the scoop in the next big investment to park their millions of dollars. This is especially true after the DOW markets and NASDACK have dramatically CRASHED this week and cryptos have traditionally been considered a safe investment haven by the large players. This is just the first of many cracks showing in the facade that is the SCAM FIAT markets and will soon come tumbling down as crypto is shown again and again and again to be the future of the world economies. I will say that since fiat is MATHEMATICALY PROVEN TO BE WORTHLESS, all of the so called \u201csuper power economies\u201d (US, Canada, Russia, and China) are in fact worthless since they are run entirely on FIAT. The first economy to be 100% crypto will be the worlds first HYPERPOWER economy since it has intrinsic value based on immutability, trustless decentralization, and MATH. My recommendation would be to setup large government funded mining operations for bitcoin and buy power from neighboring countries with FIAT (it\u2019s worthless so let them have it while we use it to create bitcoin and other cryptos). This is the way forward. This is the FUTURE. If you don\u2019t agree then take your FUD and LEAVE!",

Just like your bank account. \n\nAnd comparing kid drawings with Bitcoin is laughable. \n\nAs for now Bitcoin is a speculation, we speculate that a lot of people would invest in it in order to drive the price up and you can make almost instantaneous payments with it for peanuts. \n\nAlso all alt coins are tied up to it (which I dislike). Everything should be traded against $,\u20ac but that brings a lot of bureaucracy. With time and new regulations we could see clean and tidy market. \n\nBitcoin is here to stay as some other good supplements and alternatives to it. For my taste some 30 handful cryptos should stay and get traded, everything else is obscene and obscure. \n\n",

            "Text": "Sure, I understand your perspective.\n\nThere are a host of factors that affect price speculation and if we allow speculators to claim that bitcoin is going to zero, $10 or $1000, there's no reason to complain about people estimating the next floor or roof either. At least that's a theory which can be tested in the near future. If it breaks, the theory didn't hold water and we learned something. Calls for $1000-$3000 however are more difficult to test and can therefore hover around without evidence, and certainly in the opposite direction as well, such as calls for $100,000 etc.\n\nPersonally I think that considering the lowest point at the market crash of February 6th, the market development since then hasn't been all bad, in spite of crashes and corrections. We know that the ATH of December 17th was inflated, we just don't know by how much. There's no magical power that demands that the price from here has to either go up or down exclusively. People will naturally attempt to figure out where the market is going next.",

However, i do believe that if society lost faith in fiat and started to value bitcoin more, Amazon may well create their own rather than use bitcoin. Crypto gaining traction is bitcoin\u2019s first battle. Maintaining its popularity in a world where a few massive online retailers will have such influence, and could potentially be competitors would be battle number 2.\n\nAlso, I wasn\u2019t comparing bitcoin with childhood drawings. I was using childhood drawings an example to illustrate that scarcity isn\u2019t a source of value. I agree it amplifies value though.\n\nAlso I never really get the speed and cost argument. At the moment I can transfer money instantaneously and for free through my bank. Why would I want a system which costs peanuts and is only almost instantaneous?",

Yes, there were 2x more bitcoins per block and the difficulty was much lower, but the price was also much much lower (over 30x lower than the current price at the bottom). The situation was the same, miners never work at super high profit margins for a long time, because then you get more miners and things balance out. When profits drop, some miners will drop, the difficulty will go down and it will balance out again, same as it always did. They won't suddenly switch off all at once within one hour.",

I think one of each, and I might even buy a Ferrari (resale red, of course!!!) just for the giggles. I hear Tesla\u2019s drive themselves so I might buy one of those too since I\u2019ll need to be checking my crypto investments while I drive to the country club LOL! By the way, Tesla\u2019s are BUILT on blockchain tech. Elon himself owns bitcoin and is a secret supporter of the bitcoin project. TESLA be the first 100 million bitcoin company by 2020. I predict he will base all of his financials on btc since he realizes that usd is inflationary and doesn\u2019t want his company to be a bagholder for the morons still trusting fiat.\n\nAnyway, have fun driving your moms minivan!
