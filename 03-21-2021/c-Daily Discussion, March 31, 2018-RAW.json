Shit's unpredictable here, you think it's gonna hit $6k and then boom turns around at $6.5k and never looks back. \n\nAlways be prepped for the price to do the opposite of what you're almost sure it'll do. \n\n",

Only it took 4 months for the coin to settle this low whereas BTC stock companies crashed out in 1-2 months. The stock market wipes you out quick. I'm down 60%. The BTC stocks I traded like MGTI, HSSHF, BTCS all had crazy volatility like Bitcoin has had these 3-4 months before they stagnated down to a new low.

There is plenty of attention on BTC right now but in terms of actual daily users I dont think much has changed in the past 6 months. \n\nThe price had to come back down from 19k.  As you have the mass sell orders from mt gox coinciding with bad new about fraud and potential regulation of crypto, the price started to drop. Now so many people are just chanting  HODL not realizing it's contributing to the falling price. As a huge portion of the owned BTC is not moving around. It's going to be A long summer.

Let's call him Mr brick-wall.\n\nMr brick-wall, may I introduce you to your new friend. I believe his name is Bcash face. That's the dot in the distance coming closer; he appears as if he is sprinting quite fast towards you. There's this sound of strong wind I believe, a soaring roar of great excitement. Mr brick-wall, we will be great friends when we meeeeeeeeeet.\n\nSorry, I grew up reading Douglas Adams, I couldn't resist.\n\nNo offense intended for Bcash owners.",

            "Text": "Hey man, don't listen to the people yelling about FUD, some of them appear to be trolling in my opinion. My reading at 7.8k was that the volume was too low at that time, combined with a high sell pressure, so I sold and bought back at 6.9k. At that point I didn't want to risk anything since the purchase pressure and volume rose a bit. Then I purchased some more at 6.6k and now recently again after the last bounce. Good for you to have read the market properly, but it's definitely a hard read at times so don't expect everyone to arrive at the same conclusion. There will always be passion(TM) involved.\n\nIt appears that we have a decent rebound now towards 7k. While 6.7k might be tested a few times it looks like the purchase mood is pretty strong at the moment. Might see some 6.7k sideways action for a while.",

As a result I think many traders are waiting for better opportunities, either an increase in price or a definitive drop. So far the recent drops have been cancelled fairly quickly. If sellers are responsible they don't necessarily need to tank the price that much.\n\nMy reflection is that the market behavior and response after the crash appear to have been smart so far.",

Bitcoin is ahead of its time right now we are in the debit card stages bitcoin and crypto is the same as debit minus the banks. So if you think bitcoin will never reach its alltime high and surpass it then you must have been the naysayer that said bitcoin will never be valued over a $1000 dollars. You have to sit back and see that sometimes things are bigger than you and you mind capacity. Just because you don't understand something does'nt mean its not going to work.",

I'll be busy soon so I won't have that much time with the market, but I'll check in once a day probably, possibly more.\n\nThe best trading in my opinion is when you wake up in the morning and find a great opportunity from your last trade a week ago, without having had to spend a minute following the market or experience any of the risks of daytrading.

This will likely increase your tax liability.",

            "Text": "**Technological singularity**\n\nThe technological singularity (also, simply, the singularity) is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial superintelligence (ASI) will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization. According to this hypothesis, an upgradable intelligent agent (such as a computer running software-based artificial general intelligence) would enter a \"runaway reaction\" of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all human intelligence. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with John von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\".

Second of all, private banks don\u2019t control inflation, central banks do, and by the way they\u2019re independent of the Government.\n\nAlso, you haven\u2019t addressed anything I said. You\u2019re saying that anyone who doesn\u2019t invest in bitcoin when it\u2019s really cheap will be left behind. This implies that when bitcoin takes off, the power will be in the hands of the select few who were early bitcoin adopters. This isn\u2019t the same as restoring the power to the people. What you\u2019re describing is a shift of power from the banks to an equally small number of people. How is that a better system?",

Why do you think so many countries are trying to ban bitcoin, why are so many banks trying to ban bitcoin? The reason why is because bitcoin is a threat to them. How is bitcoin a threat? Because it takes the power from the government and banks and gives it back to the people. And if these quotes are from the 1700 and they still hold truth to them what does that tell you. I am not talking about inflation I am talking about how the banks steal your hard earned money. ",

So you are paying VAT by buying the TV and then you have to pay tax on the $500 profit as well, seems like it would be paying tax twice, VAT and capital gains tax? ",
