More people and institutional money coming in.\n\n2- Positive regulations coming from Japan and South Korea\n\n3- Crypto market cap is half a trillion, Bitcoin having over 300bn of that.

            "Text": "Theory:  The consistent incremental sell walls during the last couple weeks have kept bitcoin from absolutely *exploding* upwards... and I think that\u2019s a **good thing**.\n\nInitially it seemed more malicious, like someone or some group wanted to manipulate the market just to pull off a long period of buys while keeping the price tempered. That may be the original intent.\n\nOr, it could have been done with the explicit intent to stifle growth by someone who doesn\u2019t want it to outshine their alt coin. (While flooding miners with bogus txs to slow down moving BTC causing anxiety via its side effects and pressure for \u201cnew\u201d tech.)\n\nAnother\u2019s possibility is that it\u2019s simply an aggregation of natural sale orders on round numbers, because we are human and round numbers tend to \u201cfeel\u201d attractive, safe, and easy to grasp.\n\nRegardless, I think the overall price suppression is actually doing the entire market a favor by keeping excessive and unhealthy gains in check. I\u2019m not worried because I\u2019d rather see a gentler rise in the next few months with only minor dips (which are more consistent due to the sell wall pressure). It will help create confidence in this technology for the thousands of new market participants who barely understand it at this point.\n\nA 24/7 market is tough to grasp for many traditional investors. They like the security of a Wall Street exchange that starts and ends it\u2019s day and they don\u2019t worry as much beyond the trading day and minimal \u201cextended\u201d hours. They can sleep better. That\u2019s more difficult for some in a 24/7 market if they\u2019re worried a 50% retraction could occur overnight. The market movers may be providing a very nice benefit here.",

            "Text": "Honestly, I do not trade, I just hold. Some people can make money trading but it\u2019s very difficult, I think more often than not people cut themselves at the knee, as it can be very difficult to call the tops and bottoms correctly. But I am not going to talk you out of trading if that\u2019s what you want to do. My suggestion to you if you are new is to maybe not start trading right out of the gate. Maybe just get some BTC or whatever you want to carry and just watch it, study it and learn as much as you can about movements and watch videos and read about technical analysis. Also diversification is great. You can hedge your losses by holding multiple coins. Like for instance currently BTC has been pretty sideways today but my LTC is charging up a bit, so I am making profits there.\n\nI know that I would not be a great trader and it would eat me up watching all my miss calls and profits I could be making if I made a better call or just held. Currently I have a buddy that is trading and he would have made more money had he just held. But if you do want to trade, yes at the end of the day you want to take your profits you made in USD from selling and throw your chunk back in at a dip and then sell, and take those accumulated profits (potentially) and just keep snowballing upwards is the idea.\n\nOne example I like to tell people is that basically from 7,500 to now (about 19,00) many people waited and waited and waited for a significant dip like we\u2019ve had in the past and they never really got one. So if many traders would have just bought at the all time high and held from 7,500 they would probably have a lot more money then they do now by waiting and waiting and buying at a higher price. \n\nHope this helps, but by all means I am not downplaying trading, there is money to be made, it\u2019s just not my strong suit, but I still study and learn everyday and I toy with the idea of trading alts in the future when I feel I have a better understanding of making profitable calls.",

I just finally bought some Bitcoin the other day.\nI just figured I'd post about it; I was wondering if this would just be seen as a foolish effort by this point, with the Bitcoin being so expensive. Yet I keep hearing how it should keep rising etc., so I figured I'd try to get my foot in the door a little bit now rather than wait even longer. I guess I'm wondering if you think getting into this now is a waste of time or if the time is still good.\nThanks everyone!",

Some people's eyes turn to dollar signs (bitcoin signs?) when they see the percent returns. \"I can certainly afford to convert all of my assets to crypto and make a bunch of money.\" But then when sending money to exchanges and getting it back out takes about a week on each end and bills suddenly arise, and maybe the price takes a tumble, now that person could be in real trouble.\n\nMy two main pieces of advice on how to give financial advice are: 1) Don't assume other people are in the same financial situation as you are and 2) for the love of god, remember that past performance is not indicative of future behavior.",

They can then use future transactions to determine in the same sort of manner at what point the output address could not have been yours.\n\nSo on one hand in general nobody will be able to tell, but it is possible to put particular transactions together on the Blockchain that result in a \"gotcha\".

That's why I bought gold originally; Bonds were (and still now) pay shit. I didn't want to 'all in' on stocks, so that was my hedge. \n\nI also got into Bitcoin because I like learning new tech. Im the dude that gets a 3d printer before they get popular, fund niche kickstarters etc. Bitcoin piqued my interest the same way. I also have bought a lot of things with Bitcoin to see what the experience is. Now for the unpopular statement:\n\nBitcoin for me has only been a novelty payment option. I've been swindled before, and if I'd used a credit card it would be sorted. TAP is way faster than anything I've bought with a live payment in the world. Last time I did that the person wanted me to stick around until a confirmation went through (2014). Just made the whole interaction weird. Purse.io was fun, but not user friendly enough for me to expect my mother to give it a go. I've lost coins on an exchange going down. Hasnt happened with my bank...\n\nSo to answer will it ever be used as a currency? Lightning is the only thing I'm interested in for that at the moment. Sure BCH isn't backed up like BTC's mempool, but its still the same old novelty payment platform. The instant micro article test payments though... I see this as a potential for another revolution. I miss the tip bots, lightning would improve on those. I want to one-click tip a Youtuber, a news article, a Reddit comment. I want to tip people that make memes. We're not there yet, but we could be.",

The tech will only be forked, the original BTC chain will live on and barely function as a currency.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT BAD, IT'S OK. You have to think of BTC as Gold. Gold has no value, it's just a heavy rock. Sure you can make some jewelry out of it, but its value is held as a reserve currency. A hedge against fiat currencies. BTC is just like gold, except it's much safer (google fake gold bars) and much more transferable. \n\nSo, what would bitcoins price be if it just replaced gold as a reserve currency? Well, Golds market cap is around $7 trillion, BTC is around 318b right now. So quick math:\n\nGold Market cap 100t\nBTC Market cap 300b\nCurrent price 19k\n\nPrice of 1 BTC to match gold.\n(7,000,000,000,000 / 318,539,890,795) * 19,000 = 417,530\n\nOr about 420k per BTC.\n\n",

As clearly their incline is quicker, if they adopt the Bitcoin adopters quickly. My motivation for this is that their responsible figures know that other coins have not solved scalability issues and they are not doing a good enough job of communicating that. While there can be reasons to increase the blocksize now... it's really not something that solves all our problems.\n\nThat being said, what they have is great, too. And it can work right next to Bitcoin. One is money, the other is fuel.\n\nLitecoin is pretty dope. Bitcoin and Litecoin are basically friends.

I was convinced that I was already pretty late to the Party and $4000 seemed outrageously high at that time. Media was reporting about \"the bubble\" as much as today. There were regular articles about \"the incoming crash\" as today. Anyway, I was convinced that the marketcap is still small given its potential. And that's still the case today. \nYou are early. Don't be afraid of some dips that will inevitably happen (one day after I bought in, it dipped to below $3000 - I wasn't happy). Don't look at the price everyday. Hodl. :)",

You will never find an unbiased forum to discuss cryptocurrencies, so you need to get used to finding things out for yourself and making your own judgements. Most cryptocurrencies have a whitepaper which is a good starting point, but sometimes the white paper is either too dense, or it's just nonsensical (I read the first like 20% of iota's whitepaper and it was a complete clusterfuck).\n\nStart with the technology, if there's no technological or network advancements then the cryptocurrency is largely useless. So as one example, Monero has some really interesting features with ring signatures that offer benefits for certain use cases. Also think about usability - as one example, I no longer hold BTC due to transaction fees (an unpopular opinion around these parts).",

Dont believe the trolls who say \"get good bruh\".\n\nNot to mention taxes and fees each time you sell. You would have to predict the future and sell at the top of the peak and then have it drop over 30% and buy low to make any profit doing this once you factor in taxes. Good luck.",

Can the price move quickly enough to eliminite the arb beore you can close your position?\n3. How much capital must be employed for the trade?  What is my opportunity cost on that capital (i.e., would i be better off if i didn't pursue the arb and instead invested in the S&P 500?)\n4. What ohter risks do you have to bear to enter the arb? For example, will I have to bear quite a bit of new counterparty risk with a new exchange?  What is the exchange's reputation and history? Whats the overall risk?\n\nAfter you evalute these factors, you can decide wehther or not the arb is worth it. ",

            "Text": "I\u2019ve been seeing some delayed \u201cecho\u201d like surges in ETH / LTC. It\u2019s as if people jumped into bitcoin, did some research, and decided to diversify crypto holdings. Since Coinbase offers those three (only), I think that prequalified them for further interest.\n\nThe tech behind ETH is not perfect, but it\u2019s cleverly different than BTC in its focus on software processing versus just a store of wealth or currency.  Unfortunately many of the ICOs that use ETH have questionable implementations or are just plain cash grab pump and dumps. I believe the market will start to filter these out and punish them accordingly as more new investors learn about the underlying tech. Hopefully ETH survives the shitcoin destruction that is sure to come as the crop is pruned. Maybe the altcoins will just get traded for a ETH and protect the root coin as the dysfunctional leaves drop.\n\nLitecoin peas a great idea, and it is functioning mostly as intended with lower tx fees and faster tx processing. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much more than a proof-of-concept and that the things we learn from litecoin can improve the scaling factors of bitcoin in the long run.\n\nAdmittedly, my thoughts on ETH and LTC are largely irrelevant in the shadow of the current market. I would not have expected this much gain on either of them based on BTCs current bull run.  I swapped my meager LTC position for BTC around $120 (LTC value) thinking it was a safe gain. I was really more testing the GDAX trading functions so I would be more comfortable placing orders, but it seemed like a good move at the time. Well, the value of the BTC that I got from that swap is currently about a 40% gain since then. Not bad in common investment gains, but that\u2019s a pittance ;) in the crypto world, amirite? Anyway, had I held the LTC it would be at $357 right now, and that\u2019s a tad better than the 40% I think. Hindsight? Money well spent to get comfortable with swaps on GDAX but I should have left the LTC alone and just added to BTC from USD.\n\n",

I would not have hesitated one bit if I was verified at an exchange. Dips like that are basically free money unless you have maxed out your potential investments (which you never should for this reason).\n\nYou just needed liquidity and needed to be there at that time. There was a huge buy wall at $18k on my exchange and everyone participating in it just knew it would bounce back to where we are no (at least) immediately.",

Also, there must be a significant percentage of coins in wallets that people have lost the keys for.

I don't know if it's exact, but increasing the block size by a factor of 100 will only give you 100 x as many transactions per second on average. But the blockchain would grow 100 times as much per day. In three days, we would have a year's blockchain increase.",

That certainly might be viewed as favorable right now in general.  However consider this... what would you do if your brother needs BTC to pay for a flight from the other side of the world because they are the only transplant match for your liver or kidney and the operation needs to happen in the next 12 hours otherwise you die?  \n\nFees being unlimited allows people to tell the network how much of a priority their transaction is.\n\nThe fees are definitely hurting adoption to Bitcoin right now.  There is a lot of exciting things coming in 2018 though that should help.  Hopefully sooner rather than later.",

When a miner successfully mines a block (and gains the mining reward) he/she/it can mine the next block immediately without having to download the block (it just mined) to verify it, giving it an advantage over the others. Because the transactions of the previous block have not yet been verified by the network it will not include any transaction in the next block it is attempting to mine so as to avoid any duplicate transactions, this would result in this new block being rejected by the network.\n\n2. To spam the network. A malicious miner may mine empty blocks to clog up the network. Kind of like a DDOS attack. \n\n3. Other reasons I haven't thought of. \n\n",

            "Text": "That is correct, but because of forks you indirectly need to report holdings. Every BTC aware tax accountant I've found says that altcoins obtained from forks (BCH, BTG, etc) need to be reported as regular income valued in USD at the moment you obtained access to them (even if you did nothing with them). That USD amount you report becomes the basis for future capital gains when you sell or use for purchase. \n\nTherefore, if you obtained access to X amount of BCH you need to report it in your 2017 tax return and it's obviously because you were holding X amount of BTC at the time of the fork. I don't like that either.",

As we know, valuable metals such as gold/silver get there value for the same reason; there's a finite amount of them. Science tells us how much gold/silver there is on Earth thus we know the intrinsic value. Finding and mining those precious metals didn't come free though. Just think on the process of mining. It's not cheap to mine precious metals. Money was the fuel.\n\nSame is true for Bitcoin. It costs money to mine. Money in the form of energy and electricity via computers solving the complex cryptographs. The very act of you buying the coins fuels the mining process via electricity in computation.

They don't give a fuck about the technology, they don't understand private/public keys, they don't understand the blockchain (+ merkle trees, etc), they don't understand what bitcoin mining is even doing.\n\nWhen I got into bitcoin there was a very different vision. It was about flipping the system on its head, allowing you to send money wherever you wanted for (basically) free. This was supposed to allow hundreds of millions of unbanked individuals to benefit from an open financial system. It was supposed to allow people in countries with rampant hyperinflation like Venezuela (I used to have a venezuelan friend who I lost contact with during the waves of violence under maduro) to get their money out of a centralist / fascist shithole (while avoiding inflation so that they could feed their families).\n\nNone of that is part of the vision anymore. The vision is to make BTC yet another asset for rich people to jerk off to and trade while those will small amounts of BTC get fucked. Who else is supposed to use BTC besides the ultra rich if the network can only process 6 transactions per second? That's ultimately the source of it costing $30 to send your BTC from one address to another, which is the most direct reason that I sold my BTC (while losing my shirt to transaction fees to do so)\n\n\n----\n\nAs a lower-level aside, the problem of small blocks => high transaction fees, combined with rising btc price => more hashpower => mining becomes more difficult over time is looming. Those two factors together will mean that if the BTC price crashes (which it has in the past and will in the future, of course), moving BTC from one address to another will be impossible without paying a ludicrous fee (imagine $100, $300 etc). This means the rich will be able to liquidate while the poor hold the bag (until exchanges like coinbase go down, at which time shit will really hit the fan).\n\nNone of the above is guaranteed to happen, but it's a very real threat and part of what's motivating me away from BTC",

That does not mean that we should be that upset with them.\n\nWe are just looking for a scapegoat here that is all. Sure, Coinbase wouldn't exist without BTC, but we would be nowhere close to where we are right now if it was not for Coinbase. Their service is professional. Quality Assurance > altruistic progress. They are a business and they are acting like one.\n\nShit, they will get their in time. And no we should not boycott bread (wallet) either... they don't have segwit. They said January 2018.

            "Text": "**Tulip mania**\n\nTulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble; although some researchers have noted that the Kipper und Wipper (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619\u20131622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis. And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

            "Text": "The price differences between the exchanges I find can fluctuate alot.  Recently we've seen Bitfinex and Bitstamp trail GDAX by as much as 2k (although i personally think this was an anomaly and was caused by GDAX's system failing).  Even right now there is a $300 difference between GDAX and Bitfinex.  Bitstamp is basically dead in the center between them.\n\nI'm sure it takes a little know-how with how to read the order books and be able to gauge the liquidity of each market individually.  \n\nThis is basically the whole point of a sell wall though.  Suppress the price in the leading (price wise) market so you can buy cheaper where the price hasn't caught up yet.\n\n\n",

Emails to customers of their controlled services (mislead them about the current situation to steer them in their direction).\n3. various subreddits (not gonna promote them)\n4. Various other business / finance focused forums.  Here is 1 example:\nhttps://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/30/business-finance-investing/bitcoins-digital-currency-1011408/index1012.html\n\nI hold bitcoin.  I hold other coins.  I am not going to tell anyone what to do with their hard earned wealth.  Spend, invest, and gamble as you see fit.  But be aware of the tactics of those who only seek to profit from your misfortune.  Be aware of their motives.  \n\n(Also eventually you will be able to profit of their moves if you understand and can predict their moves...)",

            "Text": "\"18 months\" is a /r/btc meme.  It was delayed and delayed because Bitcoin first needed Segwit activated for lightning to work.  Nobody knew if Segwit would actually get activated or not, so why would Lightning developers waste there time working on something that might never happen.  Segwit activating was a huge political drama and was by no means the fault of the developers.  They had it ready a very long time ago, it was largely miners refusal to support it that caused the delay.\n\nLightning has a release candidate of the specification that came out about 2 weeks ago.  A specification might not sound like a big deal... but keep in mind there are already 3 completely separate pieces of software that conform to that spec that are all passing 100% integration tests.  The day the specification is \"released\" those applications can launch on mainnet in mass.\n\nLightning has actually already been used on mainnet by the developers and shown that it works and it works cross-implementation on mainnet.  It is not far way at this point.  You could use lightning today if you really wanted to - but you'll have a tough time finding a vendor that is going to support it due to its non-released status.\n\nBeside that... there are other things coming besides lightning.  Schnorr signatures coming which will help reduce transaction size for multisig transactions by a significant amount, MAST is coming to give new uses to Bitcoin, ZeroLink was just announced a couple days ago which I had no idea was coming, Rootstock is in a beta phase on mainnet right now and I'm sure there are many others I'm missing.",

People who have reason to make their transaction priority can do so and those who don't need the money IMMEDIATELY RIGHT NOW can low ball the market and make room for others, and everyone else used a market standard rate. The part that is particularly fair about this is that everyone is participating in the same market without any favoritism that isn't purely math based. Yes the rich can move their money around faster but the mathematics makes no determination if your wealth is deserved or earned or more worthy than anyone else's. The market rules remain the same for everyone and everyone knows the rules.\n\nAny solution that isn't tier 2 like LN doesn't scale well with decentralization. no matter how much support it may have the math doesn't care about politics. Yes it means that we have to wait for now. Thankfully that means the early adoption window is bigger for the rest of us. As great as bitcoin already is, it is still not finished growing yet. Those of us adopting now are betting on the potential of tier 2 solutions like LN and that the market timing won't be so poor that the market moves on without us. If you think the golden age of coin is now perhaps then an altcoin is right for you and you may end up winning. For now I see the strong demand for a solution like lighting network as a very good thing and I am glad they are taking their time to do it right and thoroughly.",

If on top of that we have a solid and stable price, more and more people will put more Fiat into Bitcoin. Moving their business to the Bitcoin ecosystem.",

Also for it to work you need cheap on-chain transactions to establish and close lightning accounts.\n\nThus I view LN as a distraction until block size increases for real. Plus, I don't buy that it will be decentralized. I think we'll see a small amount of centralized hubs, which is right back to the banking system that I've been trying to avoid.\n\nIn short, I'm a proponent of slow exponential block size increase with features like LN, etc getting developed at the same time. This gives the best of both worlds (BCH and BTC's strategies respectively)",

All coins will have fees rise with higher tx thruput, but the ones that scale blocksize will be fine.\n\nOther coins like XMR, which uses ring signatures, have much larger transactions. This also leads to higher fees, but XMR is planning an adaptive blocksize + some transaction size improvements which will help considerably.\n\nThere's probably coins that are better than BCH from a technological perspective. For example, faster block mining is pretty cool (although BCH may lower the block time to 1-2.5 minutes, which would achieve that). The main advantage of BCH is it's the exact same infrastructure as BTC, so a switch can occur relatively painlessly. (emphasis on \"relatively\", because if BCH does win the tug-of-war then some people are going to lose their shirts. However after that painful period everything could get back on track. The most important thing is adoption, which is where BTC is negative currently.",

You can also create a watch list of coins you are interested in and check out their progress.\n\nAlso I\u2019m guessing you already know this if you are interested in trading, but just Incase you do t, use Gdax for trading, you can save a lot of money on fees by using them over Coinbase ",

            "Text": "Segwit adoption is going slow.  As far as \"dropping\", perhaps so, but I think it also depends on how you look at it.  I haven't done any kind of chain analysis to show anything one way or another, but consider this...\n\nCoinbase is a major player / leader of the American BTC market.  They have also been talking lately about how they are signing up like 100k users/day for the last maybe couple months.\n\nCoinbase (and some other Exchanges) do not yet support Segwit.  That means all of those new users coming in through Coinbase and transacting in and out of Coinbase are not preforming Segwit transactions even if they want to.\n\nSo here is how you can skew the stats to fit your narrative, using some obviously fake but easy to get numbers.\n\nLets say Bitcoin has 100 users.\n\n10 of those users are activing using Segwit and only transacting with people that support Segwit.\n\nYou can say this has 10% adoption level.\n\nNow bring in somebody like Coinbase and say they are signing up 1 new user each day.\n\nEach day that passes as Coinbase adds 1 new user, the support level for Segwit could be said to be declining to:\n\n1. 9.9% (10/101)\n2. 9.8% (10/102)\n3. 9.7% (10/103)\n4. 9.62% (10/104)\n5. 9.52% (10/105)\n6. etc. etc.  \n\nThis all despite the fact that there are still the original 10 supporting Segwit.  You can spin this in many ways... Segwit support is falling (on a % of transaction basis).  Segwit support is holding strong (on a # of people supporting Segwit basis), etc.  \n\nYou could very very easily say that the Segwit % is dropping because Coinbase (and some other Exchanges) are not yet supporting it.   The % is dropping because the entry and exit points to the BTC network don't support it yet.   This forces their customers to not support it by continuing to use that Exchange, or the customer must move to another Exchange.   This is way oversimplified of course as there is just way too many variables to consider.\n\nOf course also keep in mind that 99% of those new users also don't even have a clue what Segwit is.",

            "Text": "> So you think it has potential?\n\nYes. Everyone has to make their own judgement. Personally I can't handle the fees associated with the 1-1.7MB blocks of BTC. This is because I actually used BTC as a currency (at times) in the past, which means that I have a lot of unspent transaction outputs which inflates transaction size. Someone who only HODLs and only has 1 output will have a better time with fees (but will still take a small haircut).\n\nFrom a code beauty standpoint, I don't like segwit. Transaction malleability is something to be addressed, sure, but the roundabout block size increase is really ugly. It's a block size increase disguised as a block weight decrease (a segwit byte weighs less than a nonsegwit byte). I also don't like that the BTC core team is not focused at all on making on-chain transactions affordable (yes, they're developing LN steadily, but it's not the solution I want. I want blockchain transactions for all the benefits of decentralization, censorship resistance etc that I got into BTC for)\n\nSo my BTC became 50% BCH 50% XMR. We'll see how it pans out. If I lose money, whatever, at least I'm insulated from the liquidity risk inherent in BTC's sluggish transaction confirmations (I refuse to let coinbase, etc have my private keys so off-chain transactions aren't an option when liquidating).\n\nIt just depends which vision of Bitcoin you agree with. A road forks, do you go left or right? A good strategy is to look ahead, which is why I recommend that everybody make their own judgements. If you're happy with where BTC is going then there's nothing wrong with holding it.\n\n[A quick digression regarding BCH - ignore all the bullshit about Roger Ver, etc. He's inconsequential in the scheme of things and is really just a distraction measure used by BTC supporters to prevent people from looking at the differences between two 99.9% similar Bitcoin chains. The BCH/BTC debate is fundamentally about different development visions. One wants to be a p2p currency, the other wants to be a settlement layer for various 'faster' layers built on top. That vision itself isn't flawed, but I don't believe you can build a sleek payment layer (LN) on top of a sluggish, horribly expensive base layer (the blockchain with its neutered block-size)]",

If your mind is open to learning about the raw structure of Bitcoin (/ decentralized systems in general), you will be far ahead of the curve. My understanding is well above average and I still would never have been brilliant enough to give birth to BTC.\n\nIf we're just talking about the BCH/BTC debate, then look into transaction throughput of the bitcoin network. You'll find it's a linear function of blocksize * blocks per unit time. Thus, to increase tx capacity, there's only two things that can be done - increase the blocksize, or decrease block time. (or option 3, optimize transaction size, but that approach only works for so long).\n\nMost people don't understand what BTC mining is doing, or how it strengthens the network. That's a great place to start if you're looking to learn.",

I'd recommend looking at mining profitability charts - looking at the past doesn't always help, but it will give you a rough idea of what to expect. (My internet connection isn't great right now otherwise I'd look it up myself, assuming the charts actually exist).\n\n> I figure buy one and turn it on for a year and maybe end up ahead of the extra 60/month on the electric bill we're already used to paying?\n\nI mean, having previously paid for the electricity doesn't effect your profit calculation, since otherwise you just wouldn't be paying for the extra electricity. However, as a learning exercise, it could be a great lesson. Most people don't understand how mining works, so it'd be a good motivator to dig deep into it (in a nutshell, a miner randomly guesses values, then runs the value through a sha256 hash function until the output begins with the correct amount of leading zeroes. why they do this is the real important part).\n\nSo my advice is, if you're itching to try it out, go for it, but treat it as paying money to learn about mining, and if it does end up generating profit (after expenses) then buy yourself a nice bitcoin beer",

Does anyone remember Professor Mark Williams, a top economist who is so well regarded that he has been called to testify before Congress many times? In late 2013, he predicted that bitcoin would crash from $1200 to under $10 within the next 6 months [1]. After he was proven wrong, he revised his claim to say that the crash would happen eventually. I guess he was smart not to attach another date to his prediction, lest he be humiliated a second time.\n\nUntil these economists are willing to put testable specifics to their predictions (bitcoin will drop to under $X within Y weeks), or are at least taking short positions to back up their beliefs, no one should take them too seriously.\n\nIn contrast, the Winklevoss Twins correctly predicted Bitcoin's rise and become Bitcoin billionaires in the process. But they're not selling because they think it will go up much further [2]. Unlike the economists here, the Winklevii are putting their money where their mouths are.\n\nTime will tell if they're right.\n[1](http://www.businessinsider.com/williams-bitcoin-meltdown-10-2013-12)\n[2](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-winklevoss-twins-say-could-soar-20-times-trounce-gold-2017-12)",
