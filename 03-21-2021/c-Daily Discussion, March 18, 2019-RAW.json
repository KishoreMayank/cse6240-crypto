I chose $10K because that's an amount of money that I could live with totally losing, but is also enough to reap some significant gains if things go well. I promised my spouse that I wouldn't invest another penny.\n\nI want to hold this for at least 25 years. And I'm not allowed to invest any more new money into it (or my wife will kill me, ha). However I *am* allowed to reinvest any BTC gains back into itself.\n\nDuring this 25 years, I'm sure there's gonna be a couple more all-time-highs, and another couple downward rollercoasters. Is there a practical technique on how to take advantage of the highs and lows for reinvesting into itself?\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "Text": "I'm in much the same position as you, although I'm accumulating month on month.\n\nIf you believe there are going to me more ATH's and more big dips, and the aim is to maximize your US$ value around a high in the future, then the aim is to maximize your BTC holding (because whatever value BTC reaches, you get back that amount times your BTC holding). So, prior to that point, maximizing BTC is more important than maximising USD (of course, you will have to decide when \"that pint\" is, and you might wipe out in advance, but c'est la vie).\n\nSo, FWIW, here is my strategy. In recent history, BTC price has moved around slowly, but with large jumps up and down every so often (the Bart pattern). Currently, I hold BTC and I have a stop sell set at a price a bit below a large buy wall, which I adjust from time to time. If BTC price just wanders around, I ignore that, but I figure if the buy wall is breached then the price will drop noticeably further. When this happens, my sell stop gets triggered; I then set a stop buy somewhere above a sell wall (but hopefully below my sell price). When that sell wall is breached, the price pops up and my buy stop triggers and I buy back in. Rinse and repeat.\n\nTo date I'm a little up on BTC, but the important point is it protects me from big losses on big drops when I hold BTC and from big rises when I don't. Personally, I've set a minimum USD value I'm prepared to get out at, which is currently equivalent to BTC at about $2000/BTC (ie., I have like N USD invested at the moment, and I'll call it a day at N/2 USD); but I reckon that if BTC did fall by 50%, for a lot of that 50% I'd be in USD, so I'm protected and can stay in the game longer.\n\nDisclaimer: if you follow this and lose all your money, we are both idiots and I am not liable.",

            "Text": ">Same thing with lightning, how does the calculation of transaction volume go about? \n\nSee, one of the things LN devs want to have is *privacy*.  This often means that a lot of transactions will not be visible at all to most nodes.  So estimating transaction volume on Lightning will be difficult.  You just can't see them.\n\nYou can try estimating this by setting up a large number of nodes (say a hundred or so) with some decent connectivity, wait a bit until new nodes connect to you, then have each node start measuring the number of successful forwards in between two set times.  Then interpolate this by multiplying by the total number of visible public nodes and dividing by how many nodes you control and have forwards counted, then divide it by the amount of time you did your measuring.  That gives you an estimate of how many transactions per unit time are (maybe) occurring on the network.\n\nThe same will eventually be true for the blockchain layer.  Innovations like pay-to-endpoint and improved CoinJoin (both of which target privacy) will make a lot of simple transaction analyses harder.\n\n> For example, if I have a 100 sat wallet and spend 25 there are two transactions at minimum right? Aa spend (25sat) and return (75sat).\n\nWrong.  Don't think in terms of \"wallets\" or \"accounts\".  The real Bitcoin primitive is the \"UTXO\" or \"coin\".  So for example, suppose you have a 100 sat coin in your wallet.  You need to pay somebody 25 sat.  You can use a transaction to split that 100 sat coin into two coins, a 25 sat coin --- whose ownership you assign to the payee --- and a 75 sat coin (minus fees) --- whose ownership you assign to yourself.  But only a single transaction is made.",

It will probably tank again half a year afterwards. I'd like to methodically sell some of it as it rises (not all), and then inversely repurchase as it falls. I had assumed there was some kind of rule of technique on what percent to take out and when. You know, a trading technique with a name, like \"dollar cost averaging,\" \"value averaging,\" etc, but with a lump sum. Is this not the right thread to ask this question or what?",

They have to use the services of a licensed custodial provider. Up till now, bitcoin custodial providers (CoinBase, Bitgo, etc) do not have a long history of provided trusted custodial services, so may traditional firms would not trust them. Now with Fidelity (and maybe soon Bakkt, a subsidary of ICE) providing Bitcoin custodial services, there is a bitcoin custodial service run by a trusted company with a long history. So if there really is a \"herd of institutional money\" coming into the Bitcoin, they now have a place that they can safely custody their bitcoins, which might mean they will finally start buying, which could drive the price up.\nOf course, this would also mean that wall street has their hands on more bitcoin, so I expect their fuckery (fractional reserve, re-hypothecation, and who knows what else) to begin in earnest.",
