But if you are not, you should know that what you are going through right now is character building, you may feel bad right now but one day you'll look back on this as an important lesson. You will definitely do better next time there is a bull run, and more importantly, if you can handle massive losses and the negativity that comes with that - you will be able to handle a lot of the shit that life throws at you in the future. Hopefully this brings a bit of light into your world as you realize that you will come out of this moment as a stronger human than you were prior.",

Take a step back and see the perspective. If you are in a deep loss because of price drop from time of purchase, don't try to trade back your loss, it may result in sinking deeper, or you may dig yourself out. But the risk is not worth it. Simply log off, forget about it, keep going to work and allow your assets to come back and amass profits in the long term. Patience will pay off. ",

They have no clue what they are talking about reading off a telepromter. They might as well be talking about quantum mechanics, it wouldnt make any difference to them. Sometime they even have some chicks talking on disscusions. Its really funny, they really dont know what they are talking about, probably didnt even read the white paper and have no clue how the cryptograhpy behind bitcoin is calculated.

Hence you won't really find any substantial advice on here which would be worth taking into account. You can see some dudes writing \"first\" for example or some motivational, emotional encouragements which are detached from reality.\n\nThe truth is very plain. Bitcoin is in free fall and as the old saying goes \"trend is your friend\" and you shouldn't play against it. Market is shaped by very few key players who have resources unimaginable to usual redditor.  The last year's Bitcoin run might not happen again and there are many crazy freaks here who hate to admit it.",

You have to wait till crypto gets adopted by society slowly. It can take a couple of years, but sure something like etf being granted could lead to amedium bullrun. Even during the bearmarket between 2013 and 2016, there were periods where it went up. Don't forget that average joe boosted the price at the end of 2017, and he's nowhere to be seen right now. So either institutional money comes in or average joe comes back, both are highly unlikely in short term. ",

Hence you won't really find any substantial advice on here which would be worth taking into account. You can see some dudes writing \"first\" for example or some motivational, emotional encouragements which are detached from reality. \n\nWow finally someone who won't be bearish and not be spreading the FUD.\n\n>The truth is very plain. Bitcoin is in free fall and as the old saying goes \"trend is your friend\" and you shouldn't play against it. Market is shaped by very few key players who have resources unimaginable to usual redditor. The last year's Bitcoin run might not happen again and there are many crazy freaks here who hate to admit it.  \n\n\n....\n",

Cloud mining is going to die. It was a scam anyway. Lazy people making money off someone else. Project token bullshit coins are going to die. They have no real world use case. \n\nThe big question I have on this cycle is are we going to see eth etc and XMR make it? In 2013 only Litecoin was left standing and I'm sure it will be again. I'm thinking there will probably be a small handful that will also be left and those three above are where I would bet but there's no telling how low they will grind.

Are stock shares finite in total supply or rate of issuance? No, they can be diluted very easily, you trust the owners of the business who are human beings to both manage the supply of shares and also actually make the company generate value to justify buying them.\n\nThere is no guarantee either that getting yourself more USD over time is going to be a good idea. So yeah, we must all figure out how we allocate money, and determine what is sound. \n\nIt's not that hard to get more money when you want some, people should not rely solely on investment for their survival. But for those who are clever and possess some foresight, it's a powerful tool, that's all. Only for a fool would it be life and death, not worth getting emotional over either. It IS character building to endure hard times without sacrificing your beliefs and principles. If your beliefs are entirely wrong, life will make sure you absolute know it. \n\nBitcoin has accomplished great things already, and it will not be stopped, not by sellers, not by shadowy enemies, not by the \"competition\", or the miners, or the services, not by Governments of all countries put together, not anyone has the power. It will keep going. That is a far better value proposition than Movie Pass.",

If people are dumping their alt coins and scared things are just going to keep going lower, on some exchanges all you can do is go to tether. I would say probably 8 out of 10 people are convinced Bitcoin is going to go to at least 5,000 and all of the altcoins are going to go lower. Ironically that's what I would expect at a bottom even though that's not what I'm suggesting. Anyway if people are dumping all of those coins it doesn't make sense that they would need to print more tether. \n\nThe number one reason I personally don't believe the tether conspiracy theory is because it's not that profitable. It's more profitable for them to keep up trading volume and keep the system Square. The one time we may have had some tether manipulation was that 6 week period From November 1st until January 15th. If you look at the curve it is pretty unnatural, but then again a ton of people could have came in at that time since Bitcoin was on TV every hour",

Tethers are sold at a huge discount, say 10 cents on the dollar.  With the understanding that it's not redeemable.  Tethers can then be used to buy other coins, which are then cashed out on other exchanges.\n\nc.  To keep the momentum, the price of BTC needs to be sustained (at say 6k).  When the price starts to go below that, more Tethers are printed for the sole purpose of wash trading and pumping up BTC.  In the wash trading process, the newly printed Tethers are dissipated into the market.\n\nRinse and repeat. ",
