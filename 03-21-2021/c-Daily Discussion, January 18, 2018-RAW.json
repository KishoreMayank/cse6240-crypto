We need to be unified in giving it the time to mature (SegWit adoption, Lightning Network, etc).  Remember this lesson Noobs: crypto has wild price fluctuations as institutional money attempts to manipulate and destroy our marketplace. Don\u2019t let them bully you into selling! Wall Street has deep, deep pockets and they are not truly afraid of crypto yet. They will lose 5% of holdings just to murder BTC and all the cryptos.\n\nRemember:  \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\u201d\n\nGreed makes us lose sight of the cause. I started HODLing because of a belief in the people and decentralized asset control. Bitcoin is not at that ideal and probably never will be - but it is better than the corruption and institutionalized, organized, and legal manipulation that has plagued our systems for a long time - even well before the 2008 crash.\n\nThis is our chance to get back some of our own control and power over our own economic futures.  Don\u2019t let them divide you. Be happy for ANY crypto that does well.",

People, you need to understand, everything as unregulated as this will have manipulators taking advantage. If you could manipulate the price, you would too. Regulations etc. are good for BTC in the long run. Also, bitcoin is by far the most distributed among all the cryptos. People are holding small fractions of it all over the world. It is the most difficult crypto to manipulate. As for the price, think of it: If you were a new investor looking to get into the market, would you be willing to do it now? Would you not rather wait? \n\nI am waiting for more countries to ban ICOs and all the shitcoins. There are those that have such low volume of transactions, that two people can transact amongst themselves and raise the price by 500%. Those need to go. Have faith in BTC. \n",

Just wondering whether the veterans of you can tell what made Bitcoin recover yesterday.\n\nApparently, it initially fell due to FUD because of those regulation announcements. So my expectation was that we need something concrete to happen to make it rise again (some announcement or event).\nAll charts show that those drops apparently happen every January. Therefore, my question is: What made Bitcoin recover in the recent years? Was there a concrete trigger or did it just kind of happen?\n\nWould be really helpful to get a feeling for \"is the worst over?\" or \"what needs to happen to end it?\".\n\nThanks! ",

However, this points to either a partial spend or change going back to the original legacy paper wallet.\n\nCan anyone explain *why* this happened?",

In 2013/2014 after it's drop following the high, it retraced 84.7% of it's value (we saw that in the last couple weeks when it hit $17k again) before falling. The next high in 2014 was at 61.2% of the ATH, for the current ATH that high will be just below $12.2k.\n\nEdit: Just as a prediction, final low will hover around $4.4k with the lowest being at around $2.7k, that is if history repeats itself.\n",

            "Text": "Sorry, I cannot agree with what I read here. You were right to sell. You felt it was the right thing to do, nobody knew at what level BT would recover. You saved part of your money, took your losses. That's right.\nThink about the people who bought around 19 K! They have not been able to recover so far and they do not know if the BTC will ever reach again that level.\nNow, there are several things you should consider:\n- Diversify your assets. BTC, ETH and maybe stocks.. Some are more dynamic than BTC.\n- Watch the market, see how it evolves and try to find some patterns. \n- Then buy when you think it is at the lowest. Buy with a fraction of your K. Wait and watch again. If the market continues to go down, you can buy again with another fraction of your K. If it goes up, wait until you think it reaches its top and sell fraction by fraction to optimize your benefits.\n- Be careful of transaction fees. Your benefit should exceed the cost of the transactions of course!\nAll this is about trust. If the market trusts a coin it will show it. Be rational, follow the market then anticipate it and you will cover your losses and even make benefits. :-)",

Back then also WallStreet and big money was not as involved as it is now.\n\nI feel people who want to game the system are moving in, especially with the lack of regulation. This is so they can make a quick profit before the government is forced to intervene due to too many idiots holding the bag after the crash occurs.",
