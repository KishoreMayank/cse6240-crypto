But he said his bitcoin investments were made with his personal money.\n\nIn December, Lasry expressed regret about not buying bitcoin sooner, saying he should've bought the cryptocurrency when it was at $300 just a couple of years ago.\n\nBitcoin was trading up 1.35 percent early Wednesday at more than $7,400, according to CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin has struggled to regain footing after nearing $20,000 at the end of last year. The cryptocurrency has lost more than half its value in the first half of this year, according to data from Coinbase. However, the price of bitcoin spiked Tuesday, with pundits saying the price jump had more to do with technical levels than any other catalyst.\n\nLasry expects bitcoin will have the most benefit for investors out of all the cryptocurrencies, saying \"the reason why I like bitcoin is because it's the one everybody is going to come to.\"\n\nIn addition to running Avenue Capital as chairman and CEO, Lasry owns a stake in the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. He spoke to \"Squawk Box\" from the eighth annual CNBC and Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference.",

Less space is taken up because transactions can be moved off-chain, but the benefits of ln long term will drive adoption and eventually we'll reach an equilibrium point where there are just enough on-chain transactions such that the fees are acceptable to most users, and whatever commensurate level of LN usage that means. \n\nRealistically, in the short term it will free up some space on the blockchain, but I wouldn't expect this effect to last long. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, both in terms of features and adoption. ",

            "Text": "> I've also read that it will be possible to open a custodial Lightning account (PayPal-like), buy Lightning BTC with fiat and spend from that account without any transaction appearing on-chain - is that correct?\n\nNope, not correct, I think there's some linguistic gymnastics going on there. \n\nThat's not 'possible' in the sense that lightning doesn't do anything to support or encourage people to use custodial wallets. Like asking if it's possible for someone else to let you store your water in their cup. The cup isn't really the important part of that arrangement.\n\nCould you hand dollars over to someone and have them manage a lightning wallet on your behalf? Sure, but it would involve on-chain transactions at some point, because a lightning channel is created on-chain, so the custodial wallet provider would have to, at some point, in anticipation, or in response to your involvement, create channels, and that'd be on the blockchain.\n\nIn case my subtle sarcasm didn't make clear at the start though: DO NOT FUCKING EVER DO DO THIS DON'T DON'T DON'T. This is a terrible idea. \n\n>If so that would seem to be a natural regulator should on-chain transactions become expensive.\n\nThere will be a point, some level of high adoption of lightning, that will entail a lot of on-chain activity, and that will cause on-chain fees to go up. Lightning doesn't make this challenge go away, it just vastly increases the amount of transacting that can be done without reaching this saturation point. ",

But that's not guaranteed, and it's also possible that intra-ath prices can be lower than what a person bought their btc for for an extended amount of time. There'll always be someone that buys the peaks. I've been travelling many times, where I've had to get local currency, and been stuck buying when the exchange rate is really shitty for me, but that's the time I need the currency, so I have no choice. Bitcoin will be no different.",

I never said anything about whether blackrock offering crypto investment services to their customers would be a good or bad thing. And if you think a FS provider offering crypto investments to their clients is \"taking over your space\", then you've no idea what you're talking about.

It's like the same cycle playing out all over again. \n\nThe best time in the world to buy any Equity or commodity is when everyone hates it.\n\nThe part that cracks me up is the news is freaking Bliss right now. I mean it's really bullish and you still have an overwhelming amount of people scared out of their minds. That's about the most perfect trade setup a person can ask for. I have been buying the living shit out of Bitcoin with all my extra money the past month. It was just ridiculously obvious. The big question right now is are we going to continue this lower high pattern or are we going to get into the northern hemisphere and trade on the 200. \n\nAug10 is d day",
