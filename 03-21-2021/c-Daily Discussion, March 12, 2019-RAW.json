The entire process takes 30 years or so to complete and never really stops evolving. \n\nThe takeaway... once bitcoin regulation becomes clearer, there may be a steady northward movement in bitcoin price for decades, and we may only have another year or so to really accumulate at these prices. The opportunity for payoff may be the biggest one of this century, so very unlikely to every come along again in our lifetimes. Food for thought!",

I\u2019m buying more as we hit that line of rising support, That is still going higher over time while the 200 day goes lower over time.  Meaning we are going to break out if this keeps happening. \n\nWhen I see a pullback, it\u2019s a btfd gift for the last 3 months and will continue to be. I think of this song I made in December on every pullback:\n\nmany bears, many many many many bears, wish death on bitcoin.\n\nLord I don\u2019t cry no more, I just look to buy some more, have mercy on me!\n\nHave mercy on my soul, so when Bitcoin is Gold, don\u2019t come begging to me! -Bitty Cent Remix, now lets win this market Bulls!\n",

I welcome you to follow us on our social media accounts and to check us in the future as we release more characters. \n\nI won't babble on for days here as the project page covers most aspects but I will be on hand through reddit or any social media platform to talk and answer any questions you may have.\n\nJust for the record - I do understand that you can't use Cryptocurrency to support via Kickstarter which is a big shame and hopefully one day that will change. In the future, our shop will be fully integrated with crypto payments but for now please don't let that put you off supporting Blocko.\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1261956944/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto-vinyl-toy-figure\n\nThank You\nMr_Blocko\n",
