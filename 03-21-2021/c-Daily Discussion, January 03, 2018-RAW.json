They also don't care about the compression methods on streamed video, what type of disc their media comes on, whether their screen is OLED or LCD, etc.\n\nThey will \"care\" about these things by proxy when big movers make their choices, and then the consumer sees it as smart to buy a Blu Ray player instead of an HD DVD Player (very broad example there) even when it made absolutely zero practical difference to the vast majority of users.\n\nThe small percentage of people who are earning, moving and storing vast sums of money on an international basis have a lot to care about when it comes to decentralisation. That's a good reason why decentralisation is important, not because the masses are crying out for it. ",
