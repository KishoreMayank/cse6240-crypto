The first cars were NOT nearly as efficient as horses. But we saw what they could become and stayed the course. That's how things evolve people. NOT by looking around today and saying \"oh look nobody uses Bitcoin to buy from retailers. Oh well let's give it all up\". That's what complacent closed minded people think, but thankfully we have innovative thinkers and many who support forward movement. I believe that Bitcoin and crypto have a gigantic role in future society, and while it needs time to materialize, it's not as far away as many may think. ",

I got a 20% discount for using Bitcoin plus a further 10% discount for using Bitcoin for two orders in a row (I could also have used Ethereum on this site).\n\nI purchased the necessary amount via Coinbase using my credit card for a 4% fee, reducing my discount to 26%. Sure that's annoying but it's also fast as CC purchases are available instantly.\n\nThe transaction cost me USD$0.11.\n\nThe third-party \"coin payment\" site that my aquarium place uses detected the payment on the blockchain less than five minutes after I sent it, saying \"payment received pending confirmations\".\n\nI then got confirmed as paid in something like 15 minutes.\n\nCrypto works, in the right context, for buying stuff. Coffee? Not so much. A fancy pump for your fancy aquarium worth about USD$200? It works really well.",

You need (at least) two people to start a multsig address, atleast one person needs to put in initial funds. Transactions then happen off-chain.   \n\n\nMy question is : Can i refill the multisig address? All posts and videos i've watched talk about initial funds, but none ive seen or read talk about refilling. When initial funds run out, do i need to restart a multisig address with new funds, or can i refill? I imagine the refill needs to be validated on the chain though.   \n",

Bitcoin adds unnecessary steps to the process. You have to convert your fiat to Bitcoin, you have to navigate the payment process system, you have to track any potential losses or gains every time you buy and sell your Bitcoin for capital gains purposes. It doesn't matter how many coffee shops or taco stands start accepting Bitcoin, making purchases just adds too many complications with no clear upside. ",

Nobe bank is going bankrupt. Bitfinex announced they switched to HSBC but I have doubt about that.\n\nUltimately, the gap exists because people can't arbitrage it. People can't arbitrage it because they can't withdraw their fiat to their bank account.\n\nI don't recommend people to trade on USDT exchanges. Move your funds to Gdax, Gemini, Bitstamp or Bitmex (since fiat withdrawals are not working, you will need to buy coins on the USDT exchanges, transfer them to non-USDT exchanges, which will tend to exasperate the gap but at least your money is safe).\n\nI personally hedged my entire stack for this reason. If Bitfinex/Tether (they are really synonym of each other, same governance) goes down, then all hell will break loose. I plan to close my hedge if they show their HSBC banking relationship is working (you can tell that when USDT moves closer to parity).",

But what's even more remarkable, and lessor known, is that storage capacity doubles every 18 months. It's not uncommon now to find smartphones with 128GB. This trend is going to continue into the foreseeable future, and that's why the blockchain size is not a big problem today, nor will it be for quite some time. Good question though.",

            "Text": "The incentive for the average consumer is simple - you can buy online without risk that someone will steal from you.\n\nBitcoin is a **push** payment system. You decide what you want to buy, then you push the payment to the seller. Just like cash. The antiquated system it's replacing -- credit cards -- is a **pull** payment system. You give the seller access to your account, and they pull out the right amount. You hope.\n\nHere's a real-world example. I buy equipment online from [Newegg.com](https://Newegg.com) several times a year. Before they started accepting bitcoin, I kept a credit card on file with them to make purchases. Afterwards I deleted the card info and started paying exclusively with bitcoin.\n\nLess than a month ago, Newegg announced that they had fallen victim to a security breach and credit card information for many of their customers had been stolen.\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/19/newegg-credit-card-skimming-hack/](https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/19/newegg-credit-card-skimming-hack/)\n\nBecause cards are a **pull** system, the thief can start charging those cards immediately. It's up to the merchant to secure the card info, and up to the consumer to dispute charges and hope they can get their money back afterwards.\n\nBecause bitcoin is a push system, money only leaves my account when I say so. There's nothing for a thief to steal. A hacker can steal from Newegg, but they can't steal from its customers.\n\n**This feature alone makes bitcoin better that credit cards, right now, today.** The other inconveniences you mention are technical or regulatory and will be resolved sooner or later. It's just a matter of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

People spend over a hundred grand on old comic books. Millions on old cars. Bitcoin is the first successful blockchain project and it has some very good roots. People are going to want part of that if for no other reason just to be part of that. I do. So do a lot of others. You start getting people to realize what they have and not sell at these lower prices. What happens? The price runs higher. Traders don't really care if they are buying .1 Bitcoin or one Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin. In fact most people don't. If that price started going on and upward trajectory again it doesn't matter what the price is. It could be $50,000 and people will buy that all day long. The gamblers only care about if it will be 51000 next week or month. \n\nIf those of us who owned a Bitcoin just decided we were not going to sell it until at least $50,000 that would happen. The supply would begin to dry up. This is what usually happens around the halving. That reduction of supply Works its way into the market in the following few months",

You're not liable.\n\nNow, Newegg is a reputable place, but paying with a credit card gives you much much more protection against shady retailers on the internet. If your order wasn't as described, never arrived, etc. etc. etc. you have recourse with the trusted third party (your bank) who is your advocate. Seriously. If you have a legitimate problem with an order, 99.9% of the time they will side with their card member.\n\nLet's say you paid with BTC, your order arrives, and oops, it's just a bag of rocks. Shucks. Nothing you can do except leave a bad review hoping that others will see it and avoid your mistake.\n\nThe worst part of having your CC information compromised is making a phone call to customer service and waiting for your bank to overnight you a new card. The added protection and reversibility far far outweighs whatever advantages a \"push only\" system has with consumers.\n\nEdit: Also, should your bitcoin wallet be stored on a computer with access to the internet? Using a credit card doesn't carry any risk of someone emptying your savings account. ",

Also, the past bullperiods were in periodes when nobody really knew how much real value crypto had. When things go up in those speculative periods, you can get mass hysteria. In a few years, we will know more about the true value of crypto, so i don't expect new mass hysteria. I expect btc to reach a value of Lets say 20.000 in a few years. Pretty much the same pattern as online businesses in the 2000s. 20.000 in 5 years is still a very good investment if you invest now and i doubt any other market will reach 120 percent gains in a period of 5 years.",

Credit card companies try to conceal that fact by charging their transaction fees to the vendor, who then pass the cost along to you in the form of higher prices. That's why many vendors offer a discount for customers who pay in crypto.\n\nNow let's talk about that lovely consumer protection that the card companies provide. The shady vendors who may send you a bag of rocks are the ones who are most likely to sell your credit card info to the highest bidder. In the much more common scenario of buying from an established vendor (like Newegg), you generally don't need fraud protection. Newegg is not going to defraud you - they have too much to lose. And even if they do, fraud is a crime... call the police! Why pay extra to a credit card company for protection you don't need? ",

I have used most of them and let me tell you, there was no incentive for anyone to use them if they didn't have to for work or were not an enthusiast. But it's how things start out.\n\nLook, I think it's common sense that more users and wider use will legitimatize BTC (Probably LTC) as a currency, investment and as a store of value. I hate typing out shit that everyone already knows, but as a currency:\n\n\\- Transactions international or local, incur limited or no fees.\n\n\\- Banks are not needed for transactions\n\n\\- Bitcoin/Litecoin can be exchanged into other currencies efficiently and function as a global currency. With more and more people shopping online, this is a big one.\n\n\\- Business doesn\u2019t have to pay for processing sensitive information from customers, such as credit card numbers\n\n\\- Perfect math maintaining the ledger and no accountants to pay\n\n\\- Bitcoin/Litecoin accounting transparency - No need for businesses to produce documents about activities\n\n\\- No cost of fraud risk for the merchant because Bitcoin/Litecoin transactions become final once confirmed\n\nNow as far as incentives for the customers only, I mean that's an easy one. Imagine scanning apps to pay.. we kind of already are on that road. Once crypto becomes efficient and adoption increases it could be a pretty easy transition. Nobody \"ASKED\" for the tap feature on credit cards right? It just showed up and we used it cause it's convenient. I believe Bitcoin has the ability to go way beyond anywhere that FIAT can go in terms of future convenience that aligns with future tech. It's far more adaptable and  scaleable  than anything we have today.\n\n**EDIT**:  FYI I still see Litecoin as the currency for smaller purchases and Bitcoin as the investment and store of value.",

So I am relying on this site to calculate capital gains and generate the necessary forms for tax preparation, all for a reasonable annual fee.  I just consider it an extra cost of tax prep. Not really that much effort as it would be if I tried to do this from scratch with spreadsheets. \n\nIt would be nice if I could get the API to easily and automatically upload all transactions from exchanges and my wallets to my tax account without any involvement from me. Maybe this is already possible and I am not aware.  This would alleviate this main inconvenience that I think is a hurdle to mainstream adoption. \n\nBetter yet, how can we get the government to change its stance on tax treatment of bitcoin entirely?  The USD is not subject to capital gains. If bitcoin is a currency, then why shouldn\u2019t it be treated similarly to the USD? ",

            "Text": "I understand your premise, but regular consumers by and large absolutely do want the protection and convenience of using a credit/debit/charge card. Obviously VISA has to make money, too, but that's just part of being a business. They are providing a service that people want, and they get to charge a fair price for it. Luckily there's enough competition in the market that their pricing has to be competitive, and newcomers like Square are forcing them to adapt. \n\nSo in your scenario, I order a GPU using Bitcoin from a shady vendor on the internet and receive a bag of rocks. I should now call the police and have them deal with it? I'm sure they will be able to compel the seller in who-knows-where to refund me my $300 worth of BTC.\n\nI'll give you another scenario... a few months ago I booked a hotel using Expedia. For some reason they decided to charge me twice. I had to call their customer service number 5 times trying to get it reversed because they kept putting me on hold to \"research\" the issue and then disconnecting me. At this point I was frustrated enough that I called my bank, explained the situation, and asked for them to reverse the second charge. Easy peasy. \n\nIf I'd paid in BTC, I'm entirely at the mercy of Expedia to refund me. I have no recourse aside from leaving a bad review and talking about it on the internet like I'm doing here, lol. ",

There is a reason iPhone is the most dominant phone now and blackberry is all but defunct. Your comment about not needing one unless you were and enthusiast or needed it for work is off base as well. One of the early criticisms of the iPhone was that it wasn't business friendly and many enterprises held on to their blackberries for the time being.\n\nMost of your solutions are from a perspective of the company and come with their own downsides such as AML and KYC compliance and will create additional complications with capital gains.\n\nAs far as your customer incentives scan to pay is already a thing. Most retail purchases in China are made through wechat by scanning a QR or barcode. It could easily be done here as well with less complication using fiat rather than adding unnecessary steps with Bitcoin. ",

I could give you a hundred examples of technology that people kept working on and it became game changing to society... even though so many could not see the potential because they looked ONLY at the current state and not at the potential of what it can become. I guarantee you, this is what you are doing right now. And so what? There's no law that requires us to have the same opinion.",

What I'm saying is that I would much rather prefer to focus on all the potential of Bitcoin and the blockchain it runs on. I too read articles as we all do, and I enjoy learning about developments that are painting a clear picture of Bitcoin being used on a main stream scale. \n\nI find it interesting and I occasionally post about that stuff on here. Yes, I sometimes talk about the coin price and how something like bakkt can fast track Bitcoin from an investment perceptive, but mostly I talk about adoption and advancement of the bitcoin blockchain.  Recently I read that along with the efforts to layer and scale, they are now looking at ways to implement smart contracts on Bitcoin's chain and the idea of what may happen in the years to come is fascinating to me. If you truly believe that tether will halt all that progress that's your choice. I personally think that a fall of tether would not stop bitcoin anymore than Mt Gox did. It may create a setback, and disrupt the entire crypto space. It may even cause bitcoin to drop to 4k temporarily, but I see a future where millions of people use Bitcoin to purchase online, store value like a savings account, invest even as a hedge or high risk portion of portfolio at first, etc. \n\nOne last point. As we move forward, more and more platforms will allow the shift between FIAT and crypto quickly. Tether is a trading tool first and a temporary fill-in for FIAT. Are they hiding something? Is there a shady reason for not providing an audit of their currency reserves? Who knows! We can talk about it all day but we won't have an answer.",
